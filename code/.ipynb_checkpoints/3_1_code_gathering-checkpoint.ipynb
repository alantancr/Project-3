    "\n",
    "As the world gains access to internet, forum moderators faced difficulty in handling large amount of spams or misclassified post. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to perform research,building and implementation of a NLP classifier model. The model which we have created is a binary classification model. This will be a proof-of-concept for the management of online forums. Upon successful POC, this project could be further taken into a scalable project for multi-class classification with sound budget."
