1,mentalhealth,1,"Both of my parents have died in a car accident early in December. I'm gonna make this post quick. And simple. Both of my parents one aged 40 one aged 35 died December the sixth 2019. I was born on June 21st 2005.

Ever since there death I felt severely empty. Like a big chunk of my life has just been thrown out the window and completely obliterated. I didn't know what to expect or how to feel. I was just trying to get in a safe space for a while to collect my thoughts about the whole ordeal. 

This is only the beginning of my problems. I have been an interesting snowflake all my life. I have ADHD. I want to be a famous horror writer/ videogame developer.
But the thing is. Sometimes I just give up out of nowhere and I start to fear something that isn't actually there.

And I lie to myself to keep me sane to keep troubling things out of my subconscious. I don't know if it was healthy. But it worked for me. As long as my family didn't know about my problems. I was happy. 

But. The day that I heard the news. I was very accepting of it. Just wanting to get grief over with and carry on with my life. Me and my parents had a very peculiar relationship to say the least. They weren't the best parents, and they weren't the worst. They were alright. They did some really cruddy things here and there but not too often. I didn't hate my parents. We just were never really that close. 

I've had depression even before my parents died. Insomnia and depression. Seem like a bad wombo combo that will lead to the eventual kapow huh? Well not exactly. I have a set of rules I always must follow and hopefully I'll keep them.

1: Never hurt yourself on purpose. That does not help anything long term. You're just causing others and yourself more and more pain  than that is needed.I

2: Help if you can. You don't always need to help, but if you are able. Do so.

3: Be a good person. 

Now. Let me delve into living in a world where the people I knew since birth weren't around anymore. The first week was just a rollercoaster honestly. I had the mindset and belief they were just on vacation and were kidnapped or something and they had to say they died or some stupid crap.

But I knew. I knew they were gone. And I at least could have done more. Could have said more. But. I didn't. Another thing i would like to note. Is that I think I have two personalitys that shift and sway at random. One day i am happy and outgoing and the other I am anxious about everything and want to be secluded.

I want to explain so many things about what makes me me. From my very odd music taste to how I view the system of life. But the point of the matter is. After the death of my parents. I am feeling like I am becoming a new person. That I just don't want to become.

While my parents were alive I had this dream where when I turned of age I would leave and be on my own and be famous or something. Something would work out that's all I knew at the time. But guess. Life. Had another outcome for me.

I mean. Life's tough. But uh, buddy life. You seriously had to throw the big double death bomb at me at the age of 14? Uncool comrade. Uncool...

Jokes aside (which I normally do to make myself more calm and accepting of my dire mental state) 

Yeah. I don't think I'm gonna turn into a psychopath or end my life anytime soon. Because hey! I at least know that if I go out. I wanna go out in the best way possible.

2,mentalhealth,1,"Does anyone get anxious because of time being limited It's been like this for the past few weeks, i keep getting anxious everytime i do something that kills alot of time (e.g studying, playing games, exercise, especially sleeping).

Today i also experienced the same thing, basically i had already planned to take a nap until 8 pm, however i overslept until 10 pm and due to that my plans of wanting to continue drawing, and finishing homework couldn't be done. Add the fact that i had to learn a subject for the test tomorrow, and you get a mixed soup of emotions that i couldn't comprehend

It just feels like time is very limited so i would want to use it to the fullest. But because of this mindset i keep feeling like sh*t everytime the plans i have for the day is unable to be done. It really feels terrible, and most of the advice i keep getting is to let go and not make it such a big deal.

I just want to know how to handle this, or maybe if anyone has the same experiences? So far the only solution i had was just to cut my sleeping hours from 8 to 6 hours, but idk if thats ok since im still a 17 yr old teen.

Any advice helps..

5,mentalhealth,1,"I am 22, and still think like a child. I don't see anywhere close to my peers in thinking in terms of thinking like an adult and making decisions. I understand that all of us are in that stage where everything looks hazy and a little scary. But my real problem is that I think like a child, I dread mistakes. I want someone to give me the answers and teach me what to do next 
eg.

- teach me how to make jokes
- teach me how to have fun
- teach me all things about life

When I look back on the past years. I observe, that I never loved myself for who I was and was always trying to be better than everyone and never had any real fun after all. But now I have accepted my brusies. But at the same time, I don't see how should I be able to chance my thinking from that of a child who wants to be spoonfed to a good reliable responsible adult that can make good decesions.

Some shortcomings I have observed in myself are -

- Don't have good memory
- Doesn't observe a lot of things
- Doesn't think on my own, want someone else to tell me the answer like a school/ college kid
- Is not creative
- Don't hold strong opinions based on observations, more based on what I hear from others and less of my own thinking. Accept easily what others say. Make ideas out of intuition on think grounds.
- Has trust issues
- Has been a sad sad person for the past 22 years. Now I am neutral. Trying to be happy.
- I have overthink about everything. Worry a lot on the worst thing that will happen. Have changed to not caring about everything.
- Am an extreme person. Where I extremely care about something or don't care at all.
- Constantly compares to everyone. 
- Think I am extremely judgemental person.

I think all of this was started from me not loving myself. Now that I have accepted who I am. And am trying to chance myself actively, but at the same time I don't see how do I go about changing my kid like thinking... or become more responsible/ creative...

I am trying my best to improve for whom I love.

8,mentalhealth,1,"Missed so much school they're threatening me with juvie. Can't bring myself to care about it or anything. I've skipped so much school, mainly because my brain is sick. In November I had a manic episode along with the loss of a romantic relationship and straight up didn't go to to 75% of school that month. I can't even remember what I did during the hours I skipped, I just recall having sudden moments of clarity and realizing I had no idea where I was. I suffer from bipolar and DPDR (Depersonalization/Derealization) pretty heavily and I guess that's what happened. Now the school is threatening me with juvenile detention and my parents with court if my attendance doesn't improve. And honestly? Fuck them.

I just can't find it in me to care about school, or that I'm ruining my life, or that my brain will keep trying to kill me. It's not that I don't care, it's that I literally cannot. I've been through so much horrible shit, survived 6+ suicide attempts in the span of 4 years, succumbed to (and fought off) a drug addiction last year, and I just want a break. I have tried talking with the school seeking help and they never *help*. I don't cause issues for anyone but myself so they always forget about me.

I highly doubt I'll graduate at this point. I've seen other kids get put into specialized classes, coddled, all to help them graduate, kids who aren't doing nearly as bad as me, and I'm still left behind and forgotten. I simply don't care about graduating anymore. I'm not even suicidal right now, and I haven't gone back to drugs, but I just want a long rest because this is all so tiring.

Everybody holds me to the same standards as every normal person, but I'm not normal, I am extremely sick and to expect me to do as well as them is a cruel joke.

9,mentalhealth,1,"[DID] My [25FtM] alternate has been ruining my life For the last 2 years (probably longer, but most noticably in the last 2 years) I have been having a resurgence of my DID, but much, MUCH worse than anything I could have ever imagined.

For a bit of backstory, I have been struggling with this since I was about 2009-2010, with it becoming a fully fleshed disorder by 2011. I got no help for it, and in the first year gained two separate alternates. One coming after my rapist older brother was moved into my apartment at 16, and one at 19 for reasons I still am not really sure of. 

The first one, Riley, would scratch words into my arms and hated me with a passion I will never understand. He fell in love with my ex and then when we broke up he blamed me and hated me for ""making her leave"". He was antagonistic towards me til the end but stopped being violent when he fell for my ex.

The second one, Pim, played weird mind games with me, and had fun figuring out how to manipulate my perceptions. I was convinced to be intimate with people I was not interested in at all, and left to feel violated and confused afterwards as to why I had decided to do so and why I felt so violated if I chose this. When I found out later it was her I felt sick to my stomach, and it's something that still bothers me to this day.

After that, I moved in with a manipulative abuser who convinced me I needed to keep my alternates, even as they multiplied to a split of almost 20, because integrating was ""killing"" them and got me *so* convinced that this was true that I had psychotic delusions about it that left me scarred as hell. I went through 18 months of torture before escaping to live with someone who ended up just being a different brand of abusive in 2015. Though, when I moved out and into my own place with that partner, strangely enough my alternates ""went away"" --or rather, so I thought. I thought it was strange at the time, but I was so happy to be rid of them I didn't want to question it and ruin things.

By the time 2017 had come around, I was so destroyed by abuse I was dissociated a majority of my day. When my ex would hurt me, he would immediately give me weed and get me to smoke with him. Because I smoked for the pain of my fibromyalgia, this created a chain of events that led to me basically smoking all the time by the time we broke up.

I was in a whole new relationship and *still*, until January of 2019, I had been smoking all day every single day. I found out last January that I had been abusing my partner at the time, and it came as a genuine shock to me. I apologized, as this person had never given me reason to question them on making such a serious remark.

My ex had trauma related to her ex wife claiming to have DID, so I felt insecure throughout our relationship about even bringing it up because it would create a very thick air that was hard to get through every time. By the time I was told this, I had convinced myself that I was DEFINITELY not dealing with DID anymore. So, naturally I concluded that I was just a horrible person, who for some reason is so horrible I hurt someone I love and don't even remember it.

I went to an inpatient facility after telling the staff at the hospital that I saw myself as a threat to myself and others, and spent nearly a month in the hospital trying to figure out what I can do to stop dissociating and take better control of my life. I went into Electroconvulsive therapy for 7 months and came out of my first session on January 25th feeling like the day had become much longer than I remembered. That was when I realized I had spent all of 2018 only being aware of 6 to 8 hours of my day at a time. I have no idea what happened in interim hours, but I was verifiably Not Present, because what I felt that day was a level of clarity and presence I had forgotten I could feel. I use it as an example to check myself even today. That day, I realized that I still had DID.

All year I have been living in fear. I am barely around my friends, and when I am, I am significantly more reserved and feel like I don't deserve to be around them. I feel so damn helpless to this disorder that has haunted me for a decade, and I am hoping this year I can get proper help.

Problem, though.

My SPECIALIZED TRAUMA THERAPIST doesn't think that DID exists, and has pretty much been ignoring that part of my diagnoses even though that is why I am seeing this particular specialist. I feel disregarded and pissed off, and most of all? I'm scared. Does someone else really have to be hurt by my hand for someone to do something?? I am already living with guilt over not even KNOWING what all has been happening and feeling irresponsible, but even when I'm trying to take responsibility it feels like I'm being left on my own.

10,mentalhealth,1,"Doctors appointment gone wrong Hello everyone , I’m going to tell you a small story that has completely destroyed my hope in our mental health system.

I am now 18 , but ever since the age of 14/15 I have always been sad , I’ve always been a sad kid , but the more I grew into myself the more I literally grew into my self , I pushed people away with age , I secluded myself from fear , I denied invitations
from sadness and hid my feelings from the world.

As a 18 year old boy in this day and age , with the amount of mental health promotion there are in my city and schools , I thought that it wasn’t an uncommon thing nor was it something to be ashamed of . hitting the lowest point I’ve ever been drawing near to suicide and crying to my myself over nothing, I felt it was the right time to go to the doctors , I hid it from my parents and co workers , from all my teachers and my very little group of friends, I didn’t want it to be public. 

So after many days of anxiety building up before and thoughts of cancelling the appointment, I forced myself to go to the doctors, in I went , sat , on my own; 15 minutes go by and the tv screen shows my name , I started sweating vigorously and shaking uncontrollably as I got up , and made my way to the doctors office. I was approached by an older lady, very colourful , very kind . We shook hands and we both sat across from eachother , she started by introducing herself , and we casually spoke for a minute or so.

Then she started asking questions , deep ones , personal ones , up settings ones , after pouring my heart out to this women , crying , as a teenager , she told me she doesn’t believe in mental health prescriptions for people my age , and told me I am perfectly fine , and how due to my age , I’m over reacting , I left the doctors with another booked appointment and a tissue , as I left the building I just broke down into tears , trying to roll a cigarette to calm my nerves , i realised how much worse I felt after the appointment then I did before.

 a few months have passed now and I never went back to the doctors , My mood has got better but I still have very dark days , but I had hope for that appointment, to be insulted and to be labelled as a kid , it destroyed all my hope for young people’s support for mental health.

I’m a sophomore in high school and, as imagined, we get a lot of work and in return, have a lot of stress. 


My grandparents don’t believe in mental illness. I know for sure I have some undiagnosed mental illness due to how badly my mental state has deteriorated over the past 2-3 years. They say “it’s all in your head” unironically and day to just get over it when I try to open up about it and ask for help. 


Recently the second semester started back up and I failed the first test of the semester. I didn’t turn in a single 15 point assignment in another class. This brought my grades down to a 58% F and a 68% D. I haven’t been able to bring up the grades because of how horrible my attention span is and my time management. In addition to this, I have a sport I play in that goes from 4-6 and I need to rest for at least a half an hour before I can actually do my homework. I try to do my work without any distractions, like my phone, but I just end up falling asleep or staring at the screen as if it’s going to do it on its own. 


My grandma isn’t the least bit sympathetic in how bad my mental state is at the moment. She tells me I have nothing to be stressed about. She tells me that I have too many problems and should just quit. She doesn’t let me have a single mental health break throughout the entire school year and only considers weekends and mental breaks. She also threatens to take away my phone or slap me whenever my grade goes down a couple points. 


She really isn’t helping and is making it worse. The only thing that’s kept me from relapsing again is painting and she wouldn’t let me do that today because of my homework.

15,mentalhealth,1,"What just happened to me? I've been dealing with a lot of things the past few months.

A mutual-ish breakup, best friend unintentionally hurting me, starting to date the best friend, her ending it without warning after what I thought was a wonderful month and a half, and getting overwhelmed at work. Now I'm kind of simmering in sadness and drowning in emotional pain and exhaustion from the best friend stuff mostly.

So today after a rough day at work I started thinking about my relationship stuff and all the hurt I feel from everything. I tried to distract myself with other thoughts and play my new Spotify playlist but I just kept getting flashes of things I missed from my previous relationship as well as nice moments with my best friend (among other things). It reached a peak and I started to cry and dry heave, both slowly building up and uncontrollable. I've had an anxiety attack before but this next part is odd.

I let my music play loudly in my car during my commute as I freaked out (yes, I know driving like this is unsafe but I control the wheel very well) and let that die out. Not more than a minute later after I sniffled for the last time, I started to feel great . Like... *really great*.

All my worries and demons went away for the remainder of my half hour freeway commute. I started to dance in the driver's seat more than I usually would. I was bouncing and rocking all the way to my playlist as if nothing happened before. This feeling of delight and high energy completely overtook everything else I was feeling. I drove with the windows down and the cold night wind hitting my face made it feel like I was flying. As I worked out, it slowly went away and I went back to thinking about all the shit that made me feel down in the first place.

I've yet to get officially diagnosed by a professional but did I just get a manic episode? Bipolar disorder runs in my family supposedly and I HAVE gotten steady, consistent symptoms before so I haven't ruled it out.

24,mentalhealth,1,"I was raped, and now I have an STD to show for it. Already had very bad self image/self esteem issues, pre-existing behavioral issues from trauma (paranoia, social anxiety, etc.), and worsening anxiety and depression. This all has made it very hard for me to interact with others, make friends, start relationships, etc. I'm extremely lonely. So after a while i turned to online dating bc I had no luck starting any sort of friendship/relationships in person.

A couple of months ago, I was raped when meeting my very first tinder date. It was a horrible experience. I remember going home and scrubbing my vagina mercilessly while crying. Wasn't a catfish (not entirely anyways), he looked like his picture and was still relatively attractive.. but he had extremely bad hygiene. To spare details, it wasn't ""oh i'm definitely about to catch something"" gross, it was ""This is probably gonna give me the worst yeast infection I've ever had"" gross. In fact I don't even remember seeing anything that was really reminiscent of an STD/STI (I know people don't need to have symptoms to have something, but i'm just trying to convey how this possible dilemma just didn't occur to me). I lied about how it went to people who knew about the date, just said it was really bad consensual sex. I just already felt really disgusted with myself and worthless, I was scared for anyone to know. found out later that he had allegedly raped other girls. I stopped talking about it all together after that out of fear that people would either look down upon me for having consensual sex with a rapist or put 2 and 2 together and realize he had actually raped me. just tried to repress it to the best of my ability and hoped it would never come up/i could move on.

Until recently, anyways. I just found out he gave me HPV. admittedly, it's one of the better possible outcomes i could have had in the regard of STD/STIs, but god have I hit a fucking mental low. I already felt unlovable and cast out by others, hell i was even so desperate to fill the void of crippling unwanted-ness that i kept using tinder after the incident anyway (no hook ups or anything occurred, met up with one other dude that i actually had a really nice date with but i don't think he felt the same way. i've since given up and deleted the app) but now I feel absolutely fucking disgusting and filthy. I can't look at myself anymore. Not only that but just thinking about my situation/feeling the discomfort of my warts consistently puts my into a PTSD like flashback of getting raped. I thought my already declining mental health was torture but this is really just making me feel extremely stressed and suicidal. I keep thinking about how my love life and respect is potentially gone, I don't know if i'd ever really be comfortable having physical contact with anyone in anyway anymore, and dealing with the possibility of reoccurring warts/cervical cancer.

The panic attacks that arise from these thoughts give me a lot of stress to the point where I become sedentary and cant get up without calming down.

27,mentalhealth,1,"Coping with feeling empty etc I just moved out of a sort of foster home facility where I've been living for two years. I still receive support, but I no longer live with housemates.

I initially moved away from my parents because it was no longer safe to live with either of them (they're divorced)

I was abused when they were still together, still abused when they split up, abused when one of them got a new partner, and abused when I moved to the other parent.
This basically included all kinds of abuse apart from sexual abuse.
This all happened over the span of approximately 10 to 12 years, and during that period I also got sexually assaulted while entering the building my therapy was. (I told my therapist, I was crying and horrified, she went out to look if he was there. He was, she knew who he was, he denied. That was the end of it. Makes me wanna scream looking back like wtf!)

This all seems to have accumulated into one big ""monster"" of sorts.
My parents are still financially responsible for me (law here), and because of that I'm required to stay in touch with them. Staying in touch would be okay on it's own as I want to stay in touch with the rest of the family. But they now have power over me and use money to force me to do things I can't. 
I'm on the spectrum and recovering from several years of a severe anxiety disorder, so my energy is limited. I can't work, so I can't get financially independent and not need their monet anymore.
I have suggested to them that they could object to supporting me financially due to me not living with them anymore, and that I would be okay with that and that I believe that would lessen the tension between us, they refused.

Currently I feel empty, unhappy and lonely for most of the day. I'm pretty much disinterested in all my hobbies etc. I feel weird and like this is simultaneously my worst episode over but also feel like I'm ""coping"" in a way, even though I feel like shit. Days pass very quickly and I think I might be dissociating or experiencing depersonalization.
I have experienced neither of these symptoms before, as far as I can recall. 
I also have increased urges to self harm, and to do it differently from the ""mild"" way I've always done it. This is also something I haven't experienced before.
I'm also experiencing general feelings of unsafety and being unwanted etc.

I'm considering getting therapy to cope, suggesting the possibility of having CPTSD or at least something with similar symptoms. But I have lost a lot of faith in therapy after ages of waiting lists, being treated like a child, or being forced to do new experimental therapies while I just wanted to get CBT.
I live in a small town and therapy will require me to travel, which sucks because of aforementioned energy problems. 

Does anyone have any general advice regarding therapy?
Any advice to help me make myself feel better?

I could talk to foster home staff but they have turned out to be too untrained to help me in previous times of struggle, and talking about it face to face is very difficult to me. They are already offering me all kinds of unnecessary help for things I can actually do, and then fib around when I ask them for help I do need.

28,mentalhealth,1,"I don't know what's wrong and it's frustrating I'm mostly curious as to what others think, and I value advice. I'm 20, female, and in college. 

I have had a problem that keeps getting worse. To put it simply, it is impossible for me majority of the time to stay awake in class and lecture settings. I'm not talking like, ""Uh oh, stayed up too late and now I'm nodding off in class."" I mean, it hits me like a truck during lectures. I'll be sitting there, trying to take notes, and then I'll get extremely drowsy and fall in and out of sleep for 30 minutes before being fine. I don't put my head down or anything, and I really don't have a choice. I also dream pretty vividly during these times. The only thing I can do to stay awake is go on my phone, but then I'm not paying attention. My sleep schedule at the moment isn't fantastic, but I am still getting between 5 and 10 hours of sleep each night. This was happening when I had a more solid sleep schedule, and was happening on days where I only had one class in the afternoon, and I wasn't even waking up early. 

I think it is worth noting that I do not use alcohol or drugs. I also had a blood test done a few months ago and have no deficiencies or any other issues. I have no known medical or mental conditions. 

Along with the falling asleep, getting started and staying focused on schoolwork is getting increasingly difficult for me. It's at the point now where I will sit at my pc and essentially do nothing from 7pm to 4 in the morning when I have an assignment to work on or studying to do. And when I do get started, I have a really hard time focusing on it. I am like that with other things that I like. For example, I like playing video games but find it really hard to open a game or keep playing it unless I have another person playing with me.

I also genuinely like school, and very much enjoy my majors, bio and psych. I just can't will myself to study properly or keep up with schoolwork. I've always had a problem with that I suppose, but highschool was easier to skate through. I did overload my schedule to get as many college credits as possible in highschool, and was relatively successful.

I'm just scared, I guess. I told myself that I would straighten up and put real effort into my classes since highschool, middle school even, and each year my sleep and focus has gotten worse and worse. I'm on academic probation because last semester was a disaster, and right now I just don't think I have it in me to pass my classes, even though I want to finish college. 

I talked to a school psychologist last semester, and she was helpful, but couldn't do much for me because my problem isn't seemingly emotional. And I agree with her. I'm generally a positive, happy person. She actually suspected I might have narcolepsy (not the fall asleep without warning kind, I know when this is happening), or possibly some kind of ADD, but wasn't sure about either, and I would have to go to a psych off campus to figure all that out. 

I was hopeful that this semester would go differently, but when that first week rolled around and I was out in my first class, it frustrated me, and kind of made me just want to give up on it all. I've lied to myself too much, and at this point I don't feel like I'm cut out for college. That bothers me, because I know I could do well in my classes if I could just stay awake and focus on the coursework. I also don't think it's necessarily laziness either, because why would I sit up all night doing nothing to avoid homework rather than sleep?

A few other things: I'm almost constantly tired. I do things, hang out with friends, but if I am given the chance to take a nap, I can sleep at any point during the day. I do not fall asleep while driving or eating, occasionally I will choose to while watching movies. People can be talking to me and I straight up won't hear what they said or majority of what they said. I'm usually not too bad when in an actual conversation, but it's bad enough that my mom often asks if I heard what she said when telling me what things have to be done. And then she has to repeat it, sometimes several times. I am horrible with time management, and usually just barely make it to where I'm going on time, a lot in part due it being difficult for me to wake up in the morning.

Am I over analyzing my other behaviors, or was my school psych possibly right about there being some disorder? I am almost convinced to see a psychiatrist, but I am doubting myself. I definitely think my falling asleep in class is too extreme not to be a symptom of something else, but could the rest just be me being burnt out from school?

29,mentalhealth,1,"How do I talk to my doctor about my mental health? I’ve got an appointment about 10 hours from now. I’ve been dealing with my problems alone for several years now and have tried my best to “stay in character,” (my way of saying ‘act normal’) but I’m finding it increasingly difficult to do so now. I’m a 20 year old college student studying accounting and my education and learning accounting has always been my priority, but now I can no longer do it effectively nor efficiently. I can’t focus. Information isn’t sticking. I don’t want to do anything. What I found to be so simple is a difficult task for me now. I can no longer just “push through” and ignore my problems and focus on the bigger picture. I know I need help at this point and it’s bad. I’ve known for too long that I needed to speak to a professional, but I didn’t think it would be so soon and I don’t want to have this talk with my doctor at all. It’s not because I’m uncomfortable with her; it’s because I don’t want to talk to anyone about it. Hell, I can’t even talk about my feelings out loud in the mirror without breaking down. I write about it, but it’s far too long for a quick appointment. Only three people in my life know about it, but I never go into detail because it’s just dark stuff that they aren’t equipped to handle. I know I need to see a professional for this.

30,mentalhealth,1,"i (17 m) have an imaginary friend im really only here talking about this because i want to tell someone about it and im afraid my friends will think im crazy if i tell them

this may be a bit long because i have a lot to say. i dont really care if anyone even reads this or not i just need to get it off my chest. it might also be confusing because im just writing stuff as i think of it and i doubt ill actually proofread it

my friend's name is cal. it didnt use to be that. i think he started as gabe but his name changed multiple times a day. it was always still him though. we are both just really indecisive. cal seems to have stuck for a few weeks now though so i guess thats what we're going with

most of the time we just chat in my head since i have family members living with me and i dont want to seem insane to them. i do prefer talking to him outloud though so i will as often as i can. i think he likes it better that way too.

hes almost always there either freaking out about whatever show or movie we are watching or cracking jokes with me. ive talked about him quite a bit to my other friends but i always make sure to leave out the part that hes not really ""real"".

now that i think about it i dont even really know if ""imaginary friend"" is the right thing to call him. and imaginary friend would be perfect and i would decide who they are and what they think. i dont have that control over cal though and if i did id be much happier to just let him be his own person anyways.

he doesnt really know much about anything since he only knows what i know education wise. he hasnt been around long either and ive had so much fun introducing him to all the things i love. he doesnt always feel the same way about them but thats to be expected from time to time.

he actually just saw snow for the first time a few nights ago

we dont have the same opinions on everything. especially not the little stuff. like his favorite color is yellow and mine is purple and/or blue. he doesnt always like the stuff i watch or read and i dont always enjoy what he enjoys.

hes exactly like any ""normal"" friend except hes always there and not real.

i dont know why he is here even. i dont think im lonely. i see my other friends pretty often. almost every weekend and some weekdays. all i know is that since he showed up ive stopped having panic attacks. and he helps me treat myself better. encourages me to clean my room or shower. even just reminding me to take my pills so i can sleep at night.

i dont think id be where i am now if it werent for him. for the first time since i can remember i can genuinely say that i want to stay alive and that is so amazing to me that i cant just keep it all in

if you for some reason ended up reading all this then cal and i both want to thank you so much.

we hope you all have an amazing week

thank you",m imaginary friend im really talking want tell im afraid friend think im crazy tell bit long lot say dont really care read just need chest confusing im just writing stuff think doubt ill actually proofread friend s cal didnt use think started gabe changed multiple time day just really indecisive cal stuck week guess thats going time just chat head family member living dont want insane prefer talking outloud think like better way he freaking movie watching cracking joke ive talked quite bit friend make sure leave he really real think dont really know imaginary friend right thing imaginary friend perfect decide think dont control cal did id happier just let person anyways doesnt really know know know education wise long ive fun introducing thing love doesnt feel way thats expected time time actually just saw snow time night ago dont opinion especially little stuff like favorite color yellow purple blue doesnt like stuff watch read dont enjoy enjoys he exactly like normal friend he real dont know dont think im lonely friend pretty weekend weekday know showed ive stopped having panic attack help treat better encourages clean room shower just reminding pill sleep night dont think id werent time remember genuinely say want stay alive amazing just reason ended reading cal want thank hope amazing week thank

37,mentalhealth,1,"I never had a purpose and it's hard to keep going I don't know if this is the right sub, but is the closest I could find, sorry if this isn't right.

So, I'm feeling depressed for a some years now, locked in my room, barely showering, bad eating habits and generally bad. I've been going to therapy for about a year now and I think it helped me figure out a lot about myself.

I always thought I felt like this because my family, since they're unsupportive and even toxic sometimes, so I didn't get to experience good things and felt too stressed to the point of breaking down.

But the more I get asked about what I want or try to talk about what I can do, I can't think about anything, and it's been like this from as a far as I remember. I always wanted any situation to end so I could be free from it, I never enjoyed things most people do like food or music or whatever, I feel like I always felt empty and tried to do whatever other people were doing so I wouldn't be left alone, but I never really felt good from it or felt like I was a part of it.

I never wanted anything. Money, a house, a car, a family, a relationship, travelling, everything other people desired just seemed empty to me. Honestly, even things like helping people or doing something for a bigger cause doesn't motivate me.

I'm not sure if I should continue going to therapy. I don't really want to live a ""normal"" life. It's like I don't care enough about myself to keep trying because if I do try, it'll just be me pretending all over again.

I wish I could find something to enjoy and be passionate about, maybe even dedicate my life to it, but I haven't found it in 23 years and the future doesn't look too bright.

38,mentalhealth,1,"I quit my job After 10 months of working my ass off, last Friday I decided to leave my job at FedEx Ground as a package handler. Since March 4, 2019, I never called off or showed up late. I took a few PTO days once every few months and took a Vacation in the middle of peak season to see my sister in Vegas, They liked me so much they let me do that. But I have not been happy for a long time, the day before I quit was the tipping point because I got sent home early.  I'm heartbroken because it took a lot out of me to make this decision, but I think it's the best thing for me to do right now. When I start having thoughts in my head such as ""Man I hope I get injured on the job"" or ""I hope this Uber crashes so I don't have to go into work today.'' I think that means its time to step away. I am having regrets about making this decision but at the same time, I am sick and tired of this job. I feel like I am being mistreated, why would they keep me on the clock during break time when they're cutting hours? I worked in the Unload Section during the late afternoons and evenings (Normal days). I worked my way up and learned how to use a pallet jack. Some days I had a radio to call off trucks that were empty. I became full-time last June and was an employee of the month in June. I hated this job from day one, the first week was hell I remember having a panic attack on my second day there. But after that day I stuck with it, they moved me to the lighter boxes. I had a guy that worked there that always looked out for me before he got a promotion. The work became easy and easier it was hard being in those hot trucks during the summer in a 90-degree warehouse but I stuck with it. I saw so many people come and go. A lot of people bitched and complained about the pay but I never cared. In late August  I got moved back to working with all the heavy boxes over 70 pounds we call those IC’s. My buddy who uses the pallet jack to take pallets full of boxes of furniture or mattress got fired. He was the Fourth pallet jack guy to quit or get fired or promoted. The Managers tried to get me to use the pallet jack but all I wanted to do was Unload these heavy boxes. After a while I was like screw it, I’m going to have to learn how to pallet jack if I want to move up. Now I have mastered it. I have had to deal with a lot of workplace drama but all my co-workers that are full time like me love me like family. I feel like I have let them down, I really did not want to quit but I had to for my own mental sanity. The section I worked in, changed managers all the time after July. Some were better than others some would not let me do my job, some of them won't give me any help. The current manager takes advantage of my hard work and dedication to the company. This guy yells and doesn't let me take a break when I should be off the clock. Even though they have been cutting my hours after Christmas because they want to save money. He also makes me stop with what I am doing and moves me into a different section and when I come back to my usual place it's a fucking mess. (New Year's Eve was a blast \*sarcasm\*)  It's been a few days now since I got kicked out of work last Thursday after making a stupid decision to try to unjam a truck door with a pallet jack I wasn't thinking I should have waited for maintenance but I did not. After having a mental breakdown once I got home. I decided to not come to work the next day. I have not been back since I feel weak, I feel like I have let people down. There is so much more to my story, I did not take this job for granted even though I hated it. I spent 8 months unemployed and this was my first gig after dropping out of college. School is a whole different story. I am scared because I don't know when the next opportunity is going to come. I have applied to a dozen similar jobs. A temp agency is helping me find a new job now. But I am just anxious. I want to start working again but I think I need therapy but I am scared to ask for help. But I need to work, I want to have enough money to move out of my parent's house before they move to Vegas. For anyone that takes the time to read this thank you!

I spent 5 months in hospital with my daughter. Her father slept with my best friend over 15 years and they were actively smoking meth behind my back.

Still, when I relax and I'm on my own (or with my husband), I act like a child. The tamest thing would be that I have a ton of stuffed animals which I cuddle with on the bed.

55,mentalhealth,1,"I want to share my story. So, for the last few months (I’d say it started in August and gradually became worse) my mental health was very bad. I didn’t want to talk to anyone, I lost interest and didn’t get pleasure from anything I usually enjoy, my grades slipped, I felt like a bother to everyone, and basically just felt like a crappy and pathetic human being. Did I think about ending it? Yes, although I didn’t have the urge to act on it. They were just passive thoughts. The thoughts crossed my mind several times a day and I felt like I was going insane. Like I was constantly on the verge of a full in breakdown, and would blow up on the next person that annoyed me. I gave up on important aspects of life and it sucked so much.

The thing is, I thought I would never get past it. I had accepted that I was just going to be a failure and that nothing really mattered because we all have the same fate anyway. Besides, I think a part of me thought I was going to end it early anyway. Why try if that’s the case? Those months were the hardest of my life.

Turns out I was wrong. Not about those months being the hardest - they definitely were - but about me never getting through it. See, I was in such a pit of despair and hopelessness that I didn’t there would be a point where things would change. However, about 2 weeks ago something just changed. My whole outlook on life is different. Sure, I could go on believing what my brain tells me. I could keep believing that I’m worthless, annoying, a bother, and stupid as crap. Truth is, someone could tell me good things about myself as much as they want. That won’t change anything. What *will* change things is me choosing to believe it. 

Am I saying I am completely 100% better? No. I still think those things about myself sometimes. I still have the urge to give up and say heck with this. I’m just better at fighting it. I tell myself that it is just my brain messing with me. I want to be happy and nobody can truly make that happen except for me. Sure others help, but ultimately it comes down to me. Me sitting around telling myself negative things about myself won’t help. I feel happier now. I also feel as though I’ve changed. Matured more even. Going through those dark times has helped me appreciate life more.

The point of this wasn’t for me to tell you how much better I’m doing. The point is, if I can getter better after going through that (and trust me it was hard) I believe all of you can too. It might be harder for some of you but I believe in you. You can do it. Don’t drag yourself down. You’re a great human being. I know the fight is hard and you’ll want to give up, but you can’t. You’re strong, capable, intelligent, and you can get past this. I know you can.

56,mentalhealth,1,"do i have a lack of empathy? For the moderators: I already got a diagnosis, and i am not looking for this post to be used along the lines of a diagnosis of a personality disorder or other disorder, this is just a personal opinion and not medical. i am just asking to see if i have empathy or not, as i have no sense of self to determine it.

For everybody else, i am a 21 year old male. since i was little i have not had the ability to understand when someone has said ''put yourself in their shoes'', i am able to try and think of their circumstance but i cannot feel or experience the feeling from their perspective, instead it comes back to me and i put myself in my own shoe and think what i would do in that experience, i do not detach from myself and psychically be able to feel what it is to be the other guy, i can try imagine and think ''that sucks'' but there is no true feeling. If someone says they were raped or etc, i would feel emotional and want to console the person, and i would absorb all of their emotion into mine, and feel their pain, but i could still not imagine what it would feel like to be them or to be another person. Mind you i would only react if this was IRL, if someone said that on the internet i probably would feel shitty but i would not care, i would feel somewhat personally attacked because i always want others to see that i have it the worst

Many times i will also feel no remorse or guilt when attacking certain people in arguments, i am unable to admit or see that i have a problem or able to see i said anything wrong, instead i hold the other person accountable. I think some people deserve it and see some people as weak and deserving of my wraths, and i am completely unable to feel any guilt in those situations or empathy.

However if i am on good terms with a stranger or sibling, i would be able to actually care for them and go as far as offering them a place to stay, because i feel sad about their situation.

59,mentalhealth,1,"saw my psychiatrist today and need advice i (17f) was officially diagnosed with and medicated for depression at the beginning of 2019 due to a mental breakdown but all my emotions and feelings had been building up inside me since i was like 12/13 and in middle school.

i really hated myself because i couldn’t live up to my expectations and i couldn’t get myself to be as academically successful as my smart older sister and even though i’ve been on varsity field hockey since freshman year the sport makes me feel really bad about myself and really anxious because i’m really afraid of messing up.

a lot of the anxiety and depression itself had to do with the college application process because i didn’t think i’d get in anywhere good.

however i was just recently admitted to my “top” college which is only my top because i forced myself to settle with it because i didn’t think i was good enough to try to get into a better school and because a lot of my day-to-day problems stemmed from this process, i’ve overall been less stressed and anxious and there aren’t any major events that i’m feeling anxious or sad about.

so i met with my psychiatrist today to talk about my medicine dosages and she and my mom and i agreed to slowly start waning off of the medicine because it seems that i’m better and overall i think i am doing better but i feel really weird because for like 5 years i hated myself and my life and the idea of suicide was somewhat comforting to me that it’s a way i can get out of the suffering and now all of a sudden i got into college and i can stop taking medicine for it. i don’t really know if this is making sense to anyone but if anyone has gone through this or had the same feelings as me please let me know. there are not major stressors in my life for me to talk about with anyone like my therapist or my psychiatrist so i think overall i’m doing better but part of me doesnt want to help my depression because i’ve dealt with these emotions for so long that it’s a part of me. if anyone has any advice or anything to say please do i don’t really know what i’m trying to say",saw psychiatrist today need advice f officially diagnosed medicated depression beginning breakdown emotion feeling building inside like middle school really hated couldn t live expectation couldn t academically successful smart older sister varsity field hockey freshman year sport make feel really bad really anxious m really afraid messing lot anxiety depression college application process didn t think d good just recently admitted college forced settle didn t think good try better school lot day day problem stemmed process overall stressed anxious aren t major event m feeling anxious sad met psychiatrist today talk medicine dosage mom agreed slowly start waning medicine m better overall think doing better feel really weird like year hated life idea suicide somewhat comforting s way suffering sudden got college stop taking medicine don t really know making sense gone feeling let know major stressor life talk like therapist psychiatrist think overall m doing better doesnt want help depression dealt emotion long s advice say don t really know m trying say

My mum first got leukaemia when I was 5, parents divorced at 6, most of my grandparents died young, mums leukaemia came back a few times. Trying to tldr my life, but was traumatic. Abandonment issues, suicide attempts, psychosis, drug abuse, homelessness. However, amongst all the pretty messed up and confused memories I have a lot. Silly things, childminder, mums job, being told to be quiet due to my dads nightshift, wallpapers, playing at parks, good memories even before and out with the trauma I went through.

(Ex heroin addict, now clean of all opiates, prescribed or not for over 4 years) danced the drug dance with anti psychotic, anti depressants that either put me ""up"" or ""numb"". Had a heart attack 6 months ago, can only guess smoking, diet or previous lifestyle, had to come off my anti psychotics due to my heart.

61,mentalhealth,1,"amazing apps that help me soooo fcking much i think you should try the ***HappyNotPerfect*** app, they have amaaazing emotion guide meditations and things called daily routines. when u do a daily routine, you start off by selecting how you feel (wobbly, weird, frustrated, overwhelmed, i don't know, etc). Then there is a paper bag breathing animation which you breathe to for a couple minutes. then you write on a little notepad what the problem is. They'll ask you things like ""putting this anger aside, what are you **still** grateful for?"". You'll also get a quick mini game to stimulate the mind. Finally, there's a quick 3-minute dive-in session tailored to help you feel better a little (tailored to your emotions). it helps me so fucking much. the app is free but i paid the full version to unlock **all** their longer guided meditation sessions, sleep guided meditations, sounds, asmr, etc.

also you might wanna download ***Noisly***. it's also free. you can play nature sounds that play on forever. you can also mix different sounds, e.g. you can turn on bird chirping noises + a small river + a person's footsteps. it's amazing. again, if you pay for the full price, you're getting a **LOT** of options, but it's worth the shot!

My mother has been a big drinker of wine for as long as I can remember. I’m 22 now, and this has been going on since my very early childhood.
My mother drinks white wine, and drinks roughly a whole bottle (probably more) a night. Most nights. For 22 years. She starts drinking at about 5pm and doesn’t stop until the early hours. She’s usually fairly drunk, slurred speech, stumbling around. I absolutely adore her when she’s sober, and I absolutely hate her when she’s drunk. 
She’s gone through two phases of “quitting” the drink, both of which lasted for about a month, and then she just goes back to drinking again. As I write this she is sitting drunkenly in front of the tv slurring aggressively at me because I’ve asked her to turn it off and go to bed. I’m sick and tired of her being drunk every single night. It’s seriously damaging for my mental health having to go through this. It’s been a huge part of my childhood and now I fear that as an adult this could really fracture my relationship with my mother.

69,mentalhealth,1,"After five years of suffering and one year of trying to get a diagnosis, I finally met with a psychiatrist. I went in hoping to finally be diagnosed with depression, as that is what I've been primarily experiencing for these past five years. I met with the psychiatrist's resident and she was lovely. I opened up about everything I could think of and she asked useful questions to gain more information. Afterwards she met with the psychiatrist and they discussed the notes she took so they could come to a conclusion. Then I met with the three of them to discuss a game plan.

I have been officially diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, but also Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Apparently worrying about everything 24/7 is not normal. Who knew. Anyways, they also upped my dosage of citalopram and started me on aripiprazole.

71,mentalhealth,1,"A million posts, saying what they feel, but not saying anything new. So, I’m gonna go ahead &amp; start this off by saying that I include myself in that title - I’m gonna vent/rant about my life &amp; my feelings towards it in a way that everyone else here seems to have done already, so don’t expect anything entertaining or eye-opening. 

I’m a 19 year old from the UK. I’m an “able genius” and I was targeted with 4 A*s at A-level (maths, chemistry, further maths, physics).  Yes, I referred to myself as a genius, die mad. 

My main problem is that I have pretty much no feelings &amp; no opinion about that. I could’ve achieved those targets, but I was so un-motivated that I never showed for college and that included my exams, I just couldn’t be arsed with it because not-so deep down. I feel like everything is worthless; I’m a hardcore atheist &amp; a complete nihilist to go along with that, I know that life has no meaning, I know that anything I do will not ultimately matter after I’m gone, I know that there are people who feel that way and just say that you should live for the positive feelings or kill yourself for the opposite. I have no opinion, I don’t dislike being alive, I just can’t be bothered with it; I don’t hate anything, I just don’t like it either. 

It’s gotten so bad, this mindset, that I’m going to university to study cosmology, astrophysics &amp; particle physics &amp; I don’t feel like I can be arsed with it, I don’t want a job, I don’t want to be jobless, but honestly, I couldn’t give less of a shit as to whether I end up with one or not; whether I pass or not, whether I die in my sleep or not. 

Everything just feels shallow and empty; my hamster died, I was disappointed, my dog died, I was less than pleased, my grandmother died, I was sad for all of a day. 

I’ve been in a relationship for 5 years, I don’t love her, but I act like I do because it makes her happy; I’ve got loads of friends, some I’ve known for 15+ years &amp; I don’t like any of them, nor do I care about them; I’m just hoping, seemingly in vein, that one day, I’ll actually feel something towards my life, a kind of lasting happiness - not the rush I get from playing video games, the twangs of sadness I get from hearing of peoples deaths, I mean, I want to feel something that actually resonates with me, something that changes my outlook on life - I just don’t care and I don’t know if that means that there’s something wrong with me, I don’t know if I care about not caring, but I do know that I’d like to experience actual happiness or actual sadness; just anything that makes me change my behaviour, or how I think, or how I act; I just know that being so empty and uncaring will make my life end the way I’ve always felt. like I can’t accomplish anything with intrinsic value, not will I ever do so.

I understand that they are family and I must ""love"" them, but I just don't. People don't understand how I never miss my family, or never want to call them up and ask how they are, I simply don't care, which is the opposite of my mom, who is always wanting to check up on me and ask how I am.

The few people that I have been able to connect to, I deeply love and cannot picture my life without them. My best friend Connor, who is basically my brother, is currently the only person that I really feel any sort of emotion and love for.

I have never felt any sort of empathy for other people unless I am extremely close to them. I don't care when I hear about someone dying, I don't care about starving people in other countries, I don't care about social issues that don't involve me, I understand their importance, but I just don't care because it doesn't effect me and I hate it.

It's almost like I've been a robot my entire life. I don't really show facial expressions, I'm unable to laugh or find things funny, and again, I don't care about the people around me. Honestly, I've come to hate people. I can barely go outside without getting annoyed because in my brain everyone else is stupid. I have no aspirations, I'm currently working right now, not going to school, and have no dreams and can't think of anything I'd want to do with my life.

Honestly, I feel like I'm some sort of sociopath, maybe not 100%, but varying degrees of it. I don't fantasize about murdering people, and never would, but I do know that if I did I wouldn't feel an ounce of guilt about it. All I would care about is the consequences and jail.

I know this is long, and basically me just ranting, but I was hoping some of you would recognize symptoms and be able to direct me to help. I'm tired of having no feelings, not caring about a single soul except myself, and overall just feeling a lack of consciousness inside of me. I've read about Anti-social personality disorder, and the symptoms are 90% what I experience, so that's what I've been thinking I may have.

I'm at a point in life where I truly don't know what to do. In the past calendar year I've gone through having cancer, raising two newborns (they're just over 13 mos. Apart), helping my wife with postpartum depression twice, trying to work enough to put food on the table while dealing with the exhaustion of recovering from chemo treatments, etc. 

Our newest child isn't sleeping at all, she's up day and night leaving both my wife and I majorly sleep deprived. Its straining our marriage, and we get absolutely no time together. 

My family consists of a bipolar brother, a ""mother"" who abuses prescription pills to the point of not knowing who I am, a father who's mailing it in and just doing whatever it takes to make it through the day, and finally, a major alcoholic brother who called me two nights ago with a gun to his head. 

I try to get them all the help they so badly need, whether it be therapists, or AA, or committment to an inpatient unit, but they all refuse the help. They continue going about life in denial.

80,mentalhealth,1,"How do I stop dissociating, and start remembering? Hello, I have derealisation/depersonalization. I am new to this diagnosis, since I was young I've been living with a mental illness without a name and it feels great to finally get a label for it, but also scary. My therapist thinks there is more to my illness than a dissosiative disorder, she thinks I have mood disorders that revolve around 'cycling', which basically means my emotions are constantly changing (unusual and fast changes without reason, unrelated to bipolar disorder) and I have no control over it. 
I have never experienced any physical trauma (that I can remember). The only trauma I think I could have is from being mentally ill, and suffering through anxiety. I know in most cases people with my illness have experienced trauma, but I havent. 
 Every day wake up, go school, sit in school for 7 hours, go home, sleep, repeat. I'm in a constant loop, and I don't know how to break it. I've recently started to draw and paint again, but this doesn't really help me anymore. 
In my classes (mostly in boring classes, but I notice it in classes I enjoy as well) I find myself staring off into space, and then waking up. I am failing my a class because I 'day dream' so often in this class. I think I'm really close to giving up, I haven't found any method of relief and I just want to do well. 
Even if I am paying attention I gain very little from the class because I csnt remember what happened, I've heard some people use the analogy that having dissosiative disorder is like being drunk, saying it's not that youre forgetting but that your brain isn't all there, and that your brain isnt taking notes on what going on (like being blackout drunk).
I just want some sort of tips to help me stop dissociating, to improve my memory, and help me control this.",stop dissociating start remembering hello derealisation depersonalization new diagnosis young living illness feel great finally label scary therapist think illness dissosiative disorder think mood disorder revolve cycling basically mean emotion constantly changing unusual fast change reason unrelated bipolar disorder control experienced physical trauma remember trauma think mentally ill suffering anxiety know case people illness experienced trauma havent day wake school sit school hour home sleep repeat m constant loop don t know break recently started draw paint doesn t really help anymore class boring class notice class enjoy staring space waking failing class day dream class think m really close giving haven t method relief just want paying attention gain little class csnt remember happened heard people use analogy having dissosiative disorder like drunk saying s youre forgetting brain isn t brain isnt taking note going like blackout drunk just want sort tip help stop dissociating improve memory help control
81,mentalhealth,1,"TW: Suicide // My friend tried to kill themselves and I saw it. This is actually something that happened about 5 years ago, but it's just only occurred to me that I never dealt with it. Especially as it was kept secret at the time, and I never really talked about it when it was all over, so if it's OK I just want to get this off my chest. Maybe some of you understand and need to know you're not alone too.

One night a group of us went out for my friend's birthday, and 4 of us ended up back at my place. We were talking and laughing and making jokes and the birthday boy played my ukele (very well actually) late into the night. It was that happiest I'd felt in a while, I'd actually attempted suicide myself a few weeks prior but I was working on my shit. No-one knew about it. 

One of the group went to use my ensuite bathroom. We all carried on for a few minutes and then something felt really, really wrong. For some reason, I remembered what I'd tried to do and that sent me into a weird panic. I ran over to the door and just started hammering on it. We'd been drinking, so I don't think I realised how crazy I must have looked and I was sure my friend was in danger. I was shouting his name but he didn't answer so I yelled that I was coming in and shoved my way in.

My friend had hung himself up inside my shower using his jacket for a noose. He was struggling and his face looked totally different, like he was someone else. I screamed and threw myself in there to get him down, but I clearly remember that his hands came up to meet mine and he helped me untie it faster, I could barely reach him. 

The friend who's Birthday it was came rushing in when I screamed, but our other friend was trapped in my room because she was sat on my bed too far away from her wheelchair. I vividly remember the sound she made as she screamed and cried and begged us to explain what had happened. I just kept repeating his name over and over. It's all I could say. 

Between us, we got him back into my room and he wouldn't speak. She was distraught with worry but he wouldn't talk to any of us. I asked him if I could please tell her and he nodded. I told her that he was trying to kill himself. She fell apart. I think we all did.

We got ready to take him to hospital and at the last moment he got up and tried to leave. He said if we tried to take him, he would leave my flat and go kill himself somewhere else, but if we left him alone, he would stay and not do it again.

It's one of the toughest decisions I have ever made. We knew we couldn't make him go. He was too big and strong for us to in force into a taxi. I checked his throat to see if he'd done any noticable damage and asked him a load of questions about whether he was breathing OK. 

Eventually he calmed down with some persuasion and he stayed at my flat. He made everyone else go home (otherwise he would go kill himself). 

I talked with him and gave him a huge hug. It started to get light out and I bit the bullet. I said that I think we need to tell someone what he's feeling, so that he can talk to them and get some support. He threw me onto my bed and my head banged against the wall. He stormed out of my flat before I had chance to stop him. He yelled that if I told anyone, if any of us did, we knew what he'd do and it would be on our hands. I followed him out into the street crying and begging him to come back inside so we could talk. I was barefoot and it was raining and it hurt like hell to walk on the stones but I just kept following him and begging him to come back. I kept telling him I was sorry.

Eventually he stopped and turned to face me, quickly raising his fist, about to punch me. I really did fall to pieces then. He didn't hit me, but I could see on his face that he would have if I hadn't given up.

It wasn't the only time in our friendship that he had been violent towards me. And I think that's part of why I find this event so hard to deal with. I have a lot of complicated feelings for what I saw, and what happened. Him and I were incredibly, incredibly close, and I loved him so much. I still see it in my head sometimes, what he looked like, just struggling, blank faced and I feel so many different things.

We aren't friends now. But I know he's alive. He's tried to reconnect on occasion but after how violent he's been with me, for my own sake I've had to keep away. I feel guilty for that, but I know I've had more than my fair share of violent men in my life. I simply can't take anymore.

But I do hope he's doing much better now, and is seeing a therapist.

If you feel like you've had enough, I'm begging you to seek support. It is there waiting for you. I'm getting better with the right specialists and treatments and I've built a small support network.

84,mentalhealth,1,"Looking for advice on how to deal with anxiety before bed Some background info: I have OCD and just am generally a very anxious person. I just got my first full time job which I'm excited about. Due to my anxious worries and fears about my new job it's kicked my OCD into over drive before bedtime. Just normal worries like wanting to do a good job, be perfect, ect. One thing I'm going to have to get used to is going to bed early and waking up early. Normally im a night owl and sleep til noon kinda person.

So basically what's going on is before bed I'm going about my routine like cleaning up my apartment, packing a lunch, showering, ect. The entire time I'm constantly checking the clock freaking out that I'm not gonna be able to fall asleep and therefore will perform badly at my job.  (Irrational, I know) it's to the point that I have to get in and out of the shower a million times. Earlier I couldn't get out of this mindset that I kept walking in and out of my apartment front door. It's like everything I do (ex: how many scoops of cheezits) will determine if I'll be able to fall asleep or not)

So basically what I'm looking for is some advice on how to relax before bed. I really think once I get into a routine it'll get better. Tomorrow will be my first official day. I got about 3.5 hours of sleep before my orientation day and thankfully I'm really good at working on insufficient sleep so it was fine. But I'd just really like to get to a place where I'm not counting down the hours every night starting at 5pm lol. So if you've got any ideas please feel free to let me know! Or even just a different way of thinking about this so I can relax.

85,mentalhealth,1,"Is it time for me to go? I’m in my mid 20s and starting to realize more and more how short life is and it makes me sad seeing my grandparents and my mom and dad getting older. I used to be so ambitious and wanted to be a filmmaker more than anything until I graduated college and realized how hard that is to accomplish. All through college I thought I was too busy to work on my film career and now I’d give anything to have those easy days back. It’s been so hard. Took me a year to get a job and it’s 2 hours away through DC traffic. I struggled with depression in high school and college and tried therapy but it didn’t really help. Instead, I learned healthy coping mechanisms on my own and got pretty good at talking myself out of a depressive episode.

However, with all these sad realizations about life, I feel like my mental health is starting to decline again and I’m struggling to keep myself happy. I don’t like knowing I’m going to work my ass off for the next 40 years just to enjoy the last 15. I don’t like that the choices I make now will affect the rest of this one life I get. I also don’t like thinking about how a year ago I wanted to have a successful film career and make inspirational films and now all I want is to have enough money to be comfortable and settle down with a family in the suburbs. That’s not me. That’s never been me and it’s scaring me to death. I’m open to therapy but I’m worried it won’t work and they’ll just put me on medication. Not that I’m against medication, but I’m worried it’s going to change my personality in addition to helping my depression. I tried antidepressants before and it made me feel plain. I felt like Spongebob when he was “Normal” in that one episode. I don’t want to feel like that again. I love my neurotic and wild personality. Sometimes I use my mental illness to my advantage when I create art or write. I don’t want antidepressants to ruin that for me. What do any of you think? Will antidepressants kill my personality or will it be worth it? It’s hard because I feel like my options are: do I want to be happy or do I want to have a unique personality? I also feel like a lot of successful filmmakers and artists in general suffer from mental health problems that helped shape their career and some of my worst times in life have helped me make the best work.",time m mid s starting realize short life make sad seeing grandparent mom dad getting older used ambitious wanted filmmaker graduated college realized hard accomplish college thought busy work film career d easy day s hard took year job s hour away dc traffic struggled depression high school college tried therapy didn t really help instead learned healthy coping mechanism got pretty good talking depressive episode sad realization life feel like starting decline m struggling happy don t like knowing m going work as year just enjoy don t like choice make affect rest life don t like thinking year ago wanted successful film career make inspirational film want money comfortable settle family suburb s s s scaring death m open therapy m worried won t work ll just medication m medication m worried s going change personality addition helping depression tried antidepressant feel plain felt like spongebob normal episode don t want feel like love neurotic wild personality use illness advantage create art write don t want antidepressant ruin think antidepressant kill personality worth s hard feel like option want happy want unique personality feel like lot successful filmmaker artist general suffer problem helped shape career worst time life helped make best work

91,mentalhealth,1,"i barely know at this point ((sorry about my name i made this account without expecting someone to see it)) i’m a 16 year old boy. i’ve been extremely mixed up and feeling like my actions are out of my control or even my own thought process. if i’m being quite honest it feels like i don’t think. there’s a lot of other things that have been getting me down and my trouble is that i can’t remember any of it. my “memory” at this point feels like a cloud of static that only holds thought for a couple seconds then it just drifts away. i’ve been thinking about dissociative disorder cause i don’t feel me as a presence, i feel like a pair of eyes and ears. i’ve kinda lost the ability to laugh, or find things funny really and if i do there’s no laugh noise it’s fuckin with me. OCD has been big on my mind, i think i’ve always had it but at a young age i never acknowledged behaviors as something other than basic human functions. man lemme just spit out some shit that goes on with me/ random involuntary spasms and twitches(small magnitudes)/ recently an unkempt flurry of emotions from varying sources but primarily stress about my job caused me to punch a wall and fracture my hand(or something i don’t have insurance so no professional evaluation or surgery). part of that is that i bottle up A LOT. like this boy doesn’t want to be a nuisance in anyway i want to help and not throw my emotions at people, but lately it’s more just been an i guess unconditional fear of speaking my emotions/ “intrusive thoughts” whatever part of my inner self i’m still in touch with will berate me any chance it gets. i have a lot of random thoughts about being killed, or delusions(in general) that the person kind of walking in my direction not making any eye contact holding a bag of groceries is about to murder me/probably having some generalized anxiety, feels a good bit like what it sounds like but social anxiety specifically is more probably more present. i’m almost never comfortable around people and (regardless of who’s around) constantly feeling like somethings wrong like i’m doing something wrong. although i follow the mindset of not caring what others think and try to keep in mind that their thoughts don’t affect me, anxiety remains a strong force in my life. it cuts through me it really comes with a lot of pain and backlash from myself. the anxious feeling causes my spasms to increase, i’ll avoid the pain of talking and looking at people.//. BASICALLY i can’t isolate one disorder, illness or straight up delusion. my life really just consists of confusion, pain and numb disconnection and it’s pushing me a bit. i feel like i lost who i am, like there was this person who was a little goofy but pretty great i miss the guy man. forgot i’m wrapping this up, i don’t have the resources to get an official evaluation. if anyone who read through the entirety of this(absolutely fucking thank you by the way you’re pretty great to be using your valuable time to read through my thoughts i appreciate and love you very much even if you just get a kick out reading peoples pleads for help) has anything to offer me i will take it i have no reservations for what that may be i don’t even know what i need or what to do what i should do i’m pretty lost lol. that being said an accurate trusted online mental health evaluation is probably a good place to start. maybe some meditation advice, methods that could assist me(i’ve practiced low level sensory deprivation meditation in the past, is that something i should go back to?). i don’t know what else i should or shouldn’t put here but i’ll try to remember to check back here. i’m sorry if it seems like i’m unthankful for your time i really am but i can’t think of many more words. ah fuck i’m just gonna post i’m sorry.

92,mentalhealth,1,"Stuck in a vicious cycle. I’ve put off posting in this community for a long time but today i’m in a very clear and rational state of mind and I feel like reaching out will do me some good.

I struggle with a plethora of mental illnesses, which include PTSD, mania, bipolar or possibly bpd, adult ADHD as well as several forms of anxiety and depression. I grew up with my abusive dad who also had many problems, yet was so in denial that he believes anything to do with mental health is “a bullshit excuse for lazy people”, and never once showed any interest in how I was feeling, leaving me to battle manic episodes and full breakdowns regularly by myself. I coped by being stern and always scolding myself whenever I felt the slightest sign of emotion. This does not work in the long run. 

I feel like i’m just drifting through life, i’m not really there in the head, like I have no grip on reality and no purpose in this world as I cant seem to fit into society anywhere and I simply can’t talk to or get along with people. Sometimes I don’t know if things are real or i’m dreaming.
I’ve tried counselling in the past and many self-help and mindfulness   techniques but I never found them helpful as I can’t think straight. 

I now find myself faced with more problems to overcome and I simply don’t think i’m strong enough to handle them.

93,mentalhealth,1,"Wanting to Tell Team Lead About Anxiety Attacks I’ve started a job toward the beginning of December in a call centre and had been coping pretty well. However, once the holiday break came round I experienced crippling levels of stress. I don’t know why this has started happening, I have zero history of mental health issues, but I’ve been having near-daily episodes of hyperventilation and uncontrollable crying over the last half month. I’ve never been someone to collapse under a large workload, so I’ve no idea why this is starting now and I’m just very confused.

Anyway, this has resulted in me taking two sick days and going home sick partway through work once over the span of three weeks. I’m worried about the effect this is having on my team and want to speak to my Team Lead about it so we can discuss solutions going forward. 

I need some advice on how to do this. I don’t want to seem like I’m taking liberties with the sick leave.

94,mentalhealth,1,"Is this normal or something more serious I should get a second opinion on? Hi, I'm 19F, and haven't been on medication in about six months. I guess I'll start from the beginning. In 8th grade I was having problems with an eating disorder and self-harm, continuing to relapse off and on for a few years after. I was very depressed and anxious all the time. When I was a junior, my guidance counselor I saw every other day due to my awful mood swings and feeling helpless about it, recommended I see the in-school therapist we have on campus. 

I started seeing her because I had awful mood swings between being depressed and borderline manic, where I would cycle between feeling so elated, and energetic, and happy, and wired, my mind completely racing to being so fucking depressed I wanted to hurt myself or felt like there was no use in being alive - they were really extreme mood swings, and had nothing to do with my menstral cycle which is irregular as fuck due to PCOS. My therapist gave me a diagnosis of cyclothymia, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety. I remained unmedicated but in therapy for a while at which point my diagnosis actually changed to CPTSD as we started talking more about my past and saw how dissociative I really was. 

Dissociation came on pretty gradually - I remember doing it once in middle school and it really freaked me out back then. Eventually though I was having dissociative episodes so strong I felt like I was high on weed, and this was before I had ever tried it. I wouldn't be able to focus, I'd forget what I was talking about in the middle of speaking, lose my train of thought, forget what someone said right before the last sentence they spoke, I couldn't listen no matter how hard I'd try because my mind would go totally blank. I'd feel floaty, things would feel unreal, I'd feel unreal too. These started maybe once a day but it got to where I was dissociated pretty much constantly, and this was between therapists. 

At one point before or right around when I began dissociating so hard I was having these really traumatic, really severe nightmares that still confuse me because it was more like sleep paralysis. They started out when I heard someone carrying a foldable metal chair downstairs, and I assumed it was one of my parents early in the morning, and then I felt really ominous and uncomfortable knowing I had to be having a nightmare because they wouldn't do that. They got to where there would be this presence of something, more like an entity that had no real shape or any way to be seen other than how it made you feel, and it would make it to where I couldn't move or talk and I'd be paralyzed with fear trapped underneath it, it would say awful things to me. Eventually I could move, it would get to where I'd just be trying my hardest to wake up to avoid it but it'd track me down and make me feel so fearful, and these weren't just like you wake up and it's over. I'd wake up, and think I was awake, until I ran into it again, and again, and again, and I'd fall asleep or wake up like 7 times during one actual nightmare, and they were so realistic and confusing I woke up and felt scared I was still in a nightmare for three hours after I really woke up. They got more and more violent until it was literally assault. I'd do this is the time of sleeping for 7 minutes, once it was just two minutes before I jolted awake again. I'd fall asleep staring at my phone because I didn't want to fall asleep and I wanted to see if I could figure out how quickly I'd start dreaming. It was really bad, and really confusing, and I'd avoid sleeping for as long as I possibly could. 

Some time after my dissociation got so bad, I also began hallucinating. My therapist told me it was due to how severe my anxiety is, which makes sense, because I do it signifiganctly more when I'm stressed or crying or upset. The first really noticible one I had was when I drove to a nearby city without having permission to, and having the cars serpintine belt snap on the interstate and having my car eventually die in the middle of downtown. I'm terrified of my parents, they couldn't know I was there. I had a slight panic attack and started crying and shaking and I also hallucinated something much more vivid and aparent than any weird shadow blotch of light thing I had before. It was like a ton of embers were in my upper periphreal vision, but they were more skinny and flat like shooting stars than they were embers, but they were really short, sharp flashes going in all sorts of directions, like skinny peices of glitter confetti but miniature in this bright yellow white glow. It lasted longer than anything I've experienced again yet. I started out seeing dark spots in my vision, some of them are weird shaped blotches of darker spots, some are smaller, and more opaque, usually circular but sometimes lines and colors going across my vision, and light spots which are usually much much tinier or are total flashes in my vision, always in random places, and none have stayed more than three seconds, and most vanish before a stopwatch would hit one second. This began with maybe one noticable one every two or three days, then two, then every day, then a few times a day, then every day every hour multiple times an hour. 

Once I began hallucinating more frequently I started taking Lexapro and Abilify. It helped me a lot - I quit dissociating almost completely, my memory improved drastically, I could focus, and think clearly, and I quit hallucinating completely. ((Unfortunately my parents are quite literally abusive, narcassistic, and horribly uneducated. Despite living with my grandmother since 9th grade, once they found out I was on antidepressants, they forced me to live with them in an unfinished house (no floors, appliances, ect.) with them and off my medication and made me so suicidal I had to leave and am back with my grandmother that's skipping a TON of important traumatic bullshit but they've turned my grandmother against medication and so I can't get back on it out of respect for her and not wanting to be homeless until I go to university and live on campus. so.)) 

Now that I've been off my medication since early October, late Novemeber, I've just gotten more and more dissociative and hallucinate more and more frequently. I'm worried they're going to increase in severity too. It's easy for me to tell whats hallucinated and whats not, like I don't confuse reality at all, not even for a minute, but today while I was in Mars waiting to talk to my hiring manager about a job I knew I was getting, I hallucinated like, a full on shadow. Like the sun had come out and was shining through the door behind me and it cast a shadow on the right side of some imaginary line and then it faded once I actually like, stared at it for a few seconds. The sun did not come out but thats exactly what it was like. Not bright sun, but just like the clouds went away. But I looked and theres no way that happened, and I could just tell, that it like. It wasn't real. 

I'm worried that maybe this isn't just hallucinating from anxiety and that I might have some more severe thing that's just now coming on or something. It just keeps on getting worse and more frequent, and I don't know anybody else in real life or online that has such constant psychosis from anxiety. I was traumatized a lot when I was younger and throught life, sexual abuse, manipulation, gaslighting, verbal abuse, all that. I just want to know if anyone else is experiencing this and has been told it's from severe anxiety/ptsd, or if I should be worried and get a second opinion on my diagnosis.",normal second opinion hi m f haven t medication month guess ll start beginning th grade having problem eating disorder self harm continuing relapse year depressed anxious time junior guidance counselor saw day awful mood swing feeling helpless recommended school therapist campus started seeing awful mood swing depressed borderline manic cycle feeling elated energetic happy wired mind completely racing fucking depressed wanted hurt felt like use alive really extreme mood swing menstral cycle irregular fuck pcos therapist gave diagnosis cyclothymia generalized anxiety social anxiety remained unmedicated therapy point diagnosis actually changed cptsd started talking past saw dissociative really dissociation came pretty gradually remember doing middle school really freaked eventually having dissociative episode strong felt like high weed tried wouldn t able focus d forget talking middle speaking lose train thought forget said right sentence spoke couldn t listen matter hard d try mind totally blank d feel floaty thing feel unreal d feel unreal started maybe day got dissociated pretty constantly therapist point right began dissociating hard having really traumatic really severe nightmare confuse like sleep paralysis started heard carrying foldable metal chair downstairs assumed parent early morning felt really ominous uncomfortable knowing having nightmare wouldn t got presence like entity real shape way seen feel make couldn t talk d paralyzed fear trapped underneath say awful thing eventually d just trying hardest wake avoid d track make feel fearful weren t just like wake s d wake think awake ran d fall asleep wake like time actual nightmare realistic confusing woke felt scared nightmare hour really woke got violent literally assault d time sleeping minute just minute jolted awake d fall asleep staring phone didn t want fall asleep wanted figure quickly d start dreaming really bad really confusing d avoid sleeping long possibly time dissociation got bad began hallucinating therapist told severe anxiety make sense signifiganctly m stressed cry upset really noticible drove nearby city having permission having car serpintine belt snap interstate having car eventually die middle downtown m terrified parent couldn t know slight panic attack started cry shaking hallucinated vivid aparent weird shadow blotch light thing like ton ember upper periphreal vision skinny flat like shooting star ember really short sharp flash going sort direction like skinny peices glitter confetti miniature bright yellow white glow lasted longer experienced started seeing dark spot vision weird shaped blotch darker spot smaller opaque usually circular line color going vision light spot usually tinier total flash vision random place stayed second vanish stopwatch hit second began maybe noticable day day time day day hour multiple time hour began hallucinating frequently started taking lexapro abilify helped lot quit dissociating completely memory improved drastically focus think clearly quit hallucinating completely unfortunately parent quite literally abusive narcassistic horribly uneducated despite living grandmother th grade antidepressant forced live unfinished house floor appliance ect medication suicidal leave grandmother s skipping ton important traumatic bullshit turned grandmother medication t respect wanting homeless university live campus medication early october late novemeber just gotten dissociative hallucinate frequently m worried going increase severity s easy tell whats hallucinated whats like don t confuse reality minute today mar waiting talk hiring manager job knew getting hallucinated like shadow like sun come shining door cast shadow right imaginary line faded actually like stared second sun did come thats exactly like bright sun just like cloud went away looked there way happened just tell like wasn t real m worried maybe isn t just hallucinating anxiety severe thing s just coming just keep getting worse frequent don t know anybody real life online constant psychosis anxiety traumatized lot younger throught life sexual abuse manipulation gaslighting verbal abuse just want know experiencing told s severe anxiety ptsd worried second opinion diagnosis

96,mentalhealth,1,"How can I take control of my life? I'm 29M.

I was living on my own three years ago and working at an insurance company when I got laid off. I freaked out and became extremely depressed. I spend several months working jobs at different grocery stores and Target, and most of them I quit just by not showing up one day.

I'm extremely stressed about building a career for the long term, and it feels like so big a task when I don't even have a clear idea of what I want. I get overwhelmed and stop trying. And then I end up frantically trying to get work in fields that I know play only to my weaknesses because it is what I'm familiar with.

My dad nagged and guilt tripped me for months to move back in with him and work as a merchandiser at a company he's been with for 35 years. In doing so I lost the unemployment benefits and mental health counseling I was receiving. I really hate living with him for a number of reasons and hated that job even more. I want to be independent and be out of that shitty small town forever. 

My dad is an alcoholic and impossible to get through to. I could get another job but I would still be in the same place. I could get my own place but I would still be in the same place with less money than I'm giving my dad as rent. I'm stuck and can't do anything. I have no support network or friends. I've put all my friendships on hold until I'm independent again. My mom is also unstable and controlling. She demands that I live within an hour of her and cusses me out about how I'm lazy and being enabled for living with my dad.

I know I need to do something for myself and fast. All of my ""dream careers"" require grad school, which I don't have the money or references to get into. I think about killing myself all the time because life seems too impossible. I'm getting old and all the doors are closing. Nobody's going to want to hire me, much less be my friend or marry me.

102,mentalhealth,1,"I have been exploring the idea of a 'simple solution' to achieve peace of mind and mental stability. Here it is. While meditating today and trying to deal with my usual whirlwind of unpleasant thoughts in my mind, it suddenly occurred to me that there might be a simple solution to all mental peace. Right or wrong, I have been searching for a 'master key', something that could definitively restore balance to my mind (I have suffered from psychosis for the last 8 months) and I think this might be it:

The complete lack of an opinion. It suddenly appeared to me that the instability of my mind was linked to my constantly having an opinion regarding my state of mind - my dissatisfaction drove me to overthink in my quest to 'fix myself'. But then, during my meditation, I tried simply not having an opinion at all. It only took a few seconds and utterances of ""have no opinion, have no judgement"" and boom. That was it. My mind was suddenly quiet. For the next hour I wondered in amazement, stared at walls and marveled at the absolute nothingness I was experiencing. It was like my mind accepted that this was the solution I had been searching for, and it complied in the application of having no opinion. Whereas before there was a struggle to dampen the chaos and find peace, there was now peace and silence, my mind confidently allowing itself not to have an opinion on anything at all, perfectly able to sit and stare at a random part of my room, with only the faintest of thoughts coming to the surface, and even briefly at that unless I decided I wanted to think.

105,mentalhealth,1,"Been stable for years now I was diagnosed with bipolar about 3 years ago. I had the problem for about 8 years in total. It would basically involve having these “episodes” where I seemed to lose the plot. I would talk a lot more, talk a lot of nonsense at a fast pace, embarras myself on social media by posting a lot of cringeworthy sometimes nonsensical posting, I was also violent and aggressive quite often with people who I felt were getting in the way. I felt like I was on my way to achieving greatness. I felt like I was onto a good thing. This led me to be sectioned a couple of times especially when I got violent. I didn’t really suffer with any delusions of hallucinations except possibly grandiose thinking. I would say things like “my sister is the devil” but I didn’t actually believe that it was more like she was getting on my nerves and I wanted people to believe me. I wonder if I’ve been medically “institutionalised” ie believing I am mad so acting that way. When it first happened I was getting over a break up and I was feeling very low and my way of thinking was a bit random and jumbled up thoughts and speech and my dad took me to the hospital because of a random purchase I made. But nothing extreme. I have for the past 3 years been completely stable. I have been taking antipsychotics for the whole time so I guess I can thank them for that. But I literally never got depressed except when it all started and I am ok in general now. Sure I am not perfect but I don’t think you can label my problems with having mental health problems. Sometimes I wonder if these episodes weren’t anything to do with having a disorder and maybe I was just acting a bit wild for some other reason. Anyone have some insight? Does it sound like I have bipolar or could it have been something else?",stable year diagnosed bipolar year ago problem year total basically involve having episode lose plot talk lot talk lot nonsense fast pace embarras social medium posting lot cringeworthy nonsensical posting violent aggressive quite people felt getting way felt like way achieving greatness felt like good thing led sectioned couple time especially got violent didn t really suffer delusion hallucination possibly grandiose thinking say thing like sister devil didn t actually believe like getting nerve wanted people believe wonder medically institutionalised believing mad acting way happened getting break feeling low way thinking bit random jumbled thought speech dad took hospital random purchase extreme past year completely stable taking antipsychotic time guess thank literally got depressed started ok general sure perfect don t think label problem having problem wonder episode weren t having disorder maybe just acting bit wild reason insight doe sound like bipolar
106,mentalhealth,1,"Some positive things are happening for once in my life Today at school we had athletics. It was Interhigh so it was just our school's kids competing against each other. Amyways, so i took part in A few items, Javelin, Discus, shot put and 100m sprint. Originally i just would have took part in shot put and 100m sprint, but i decided to try a few other things. I wanted to try hurdles again, but i didn't because of an old knee injury, so i didn't want to risk getting hurt unnecesarily as i am in a provincial team for indoor cricket and i don't want to mess it up. But anyways. So i got in for javelin and shot put and idk about the 100m yet. I was very anxious before running the 100m, but instead of fueling those negative thoughts i tried saying positive things to myself like i am strong i can do this etc, it calmed me down, and even if i didn't win, i was pretty fine with my result. I just did it for the fun anyways. Me and my two friends spent the day together. For once in a very long time i was genuinely happy. I wake up each day plastering a fake smile onto my face but today i was happy. It felt good. I'm battling multiple mentall illnesses but i'm trying to pick up the pieces one by one.

107,mentalhealth,1,"I feel like a walking husk of a person I don't really know how else to explain it. I've felt this way since October of last year. It's affecting my relationship with my mom (which already isn't that great to begin with), and what little friends that I have left. It's affecting my performance at school, so much to the point where I'm going to get kicked out pretty soon, probably even next month. I'm absent all the time, and I'm failing more than half of my classes. But I just don't care anymore. I don't know why, or where this change in behaviour came from, but I don't care as much as I used to. 

On top of that, if I try to explain how I feel to my parents, whether it's because I've had a bad day or I need to vent about something, they reply with something along the lines of ""well, you have a roof over your head, and food on the table, don't you? You shouldn't feel [insert emotion here]. You're better off than a lot of people,"" regardless of context. Or, I need to find the exact reason as to why I feel a certain way, or it's invalid. Most times (as of late) there isn't. Like now. Or 3-4 months ago. 

But again, I feel like a walking husk most, if not all of the time. Similar to a numbing feeling.

My mom and dad was absent for quite a period of time on and off throughout my childhood. I lived with my grandparents on and off because of that. 

My parents had a not so happy marriage early on. My older sister lived far away from home since I was young because of college, she was a very successful kid and really smart. My youngest sister was lucky she was born when my parents reconciled and be happy together a gain. 

So during the time they were absent and reappear in my life it were pretty rough. They were very verbal towards each other and towards me. I got hit here and there occasionally. So to sum it up, verbally and physically abused. 

Now that I grew up into a decent person, we left all the past behind and live for the present. We love each other and I forgave them about everything. Now we are on good term and I love them dearly, it just seems like I can’t totally shake the past out of me. It had a very huge impact on my personality that I have trouble with trusting people, I’m emotionally unavailable and I have fear of intimacy. 

Now as I am getting older I feel it’s hard to be in a relationship when all I want is to act like a strong independent woman with pretty masculine looks and in the same time fishing for men validation, but not to date them tho. I will run away once someone wants to emotionally get closer to me.

121,mentalhealth,1,"Great, now I am paranoid...this is my fucking life now. (Kinda funny happenings from today) Earlier today, I was legit just waiting for the bus (had my bus pass in hand!) and a police cruiser came around the corner and pulled in to where the buses stop. I got SO paranoid that he was there for me (I did tell my PO about the contact I had yesterday with a cop even though it wasn't a bad thing) that I was just waiting for him to come out of his car and tell me to put my hands on the building behind me...I KNEW I was not doing a DAMN thing illegal. Then another police car went by, but he went straight up the street, not stopping and not paying a bit of attention to me at all. The cop that was stopped in the bus lane was doing something and was on the phone, further fueling my paranoia. Fuck my life. I got on the bus with no problem. Noone stopped me. Noone even cared (well, the bus driver had some sympathy for me when he saw how cold I was from standing out there for a while) and I got home just fine.

My friend, Dante, who is also a convicted arsonist (from WAY back in the day--I am a late bloomer) warned me that I would be paranoid for a while (he still is to this day and he is my age and his incident had been way back when he was little more than a kid) and that if there are any suspicious fires in my area that the police will be knocking on my door...wonderful.

I am listening to the local police scanner frequency on-line and there was just a dumpster fire, but it was in the next  borough over and not in the city. Still, that was my MO...waiting to see if I am contacted. So far nothing.

This is my life guys. Take it from me...

DO NOT COMMIT A CRIME. It will fuck you over financially (I don't even know what my fines are going to be but I suspect it will be a nice small fortune), socially (people know what I am and what I did, but thankfully they are more sympathetic because in the media I was portrayed as just a mentally ill individual who didn't have her meds), emotionally (I am paranoid and worried that my PO will take me back to the prison, though I am getting everything I had to do done), and even physically (I ache all the time and I haven't been sleeping)...

Just (DON'T!) DO IT!

125,mentalhealth,1,"I don't know how to tell my parents that I might need to see a therapist I'm 19, living with my mom. For the last few months, my life has changed a lot. I don't know exactly what's wrong or if there even is something wrong. I feel really lost in life. I don't have any passions or hobbies other than playing videogames and hanging out with friends. I've also been smoking weed on a daily basis (they don't know ofc) and I know it is part of the issue but I've experienced withdrawal effects when trying to stop so at the moment I'm trying to reduce the frequency at which I smoke.

I've had some pretty noticeable mood swings in the past months too. Sometimes I feel really confident like I'm the best me I've ever been and I become very productive but in the end, I always end up not finishing anything. Other times I just skip school because I don't even see the point of getting up to do something I don't enjoy to get a job I don't enjoy and live my life unhappy. 

I also feel really insecure about certain things like my weight, height, my accent (I'm an immigrant) and trivial stuff to some like reading to the class or getting a bad grade are enough to put me on a shitty mood for the rest of the day.

I can't seem to find motivation and I have really bad procrastination issues (for school, any daily tasks my mom asks me to do or even something I decided to do by myself)

As a consequence of all of that, although my grades are still average, they are a lot worse than what they used to be before.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the problem: My parents are divorced and I live with my mom. My mom is the type of person to tell me to endure my problems and they will eventually go away. I also seem very tired most of the time when I see her after school so she might mistake my ""mental problems"" for fatigue. 

Now my dad doesn't believe in mental illness and thinks depression, anxiety and such don't exist. He's the one I'm closest to him and I only rant about stuff to him but for some reason, he always tries to make me feel like I'm not right whenever I do it. Sometimes I just want him to say something like: ""I understand. If you wanna talk I'm here"" instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how to tell them because I'm 100% sure they will both say it's just something temporary that will go away or they will just look the other way and hope for my problems to go away.

I've considered talking about it to one of my teachers but I'm too scared she won't believe me because I really don't look like I would have these kinds of problems. I also can't talk about it to my friends because we used to make fun of it (and I regret it now) and it's just too hypocritical and my pride couldn't take it. 

There's a lot of stuff that I didn't write simply because I don't know how to put it into words or insert it in this post.

I already visited a psychoterapist once and a psychiatrist but I went privately and I could make an appointment online. Going there was stressful too but I was comforted by the thoughts that these are people that work with delicate matters and they'll be gentle and understanding. And they were actually great. But the problem is I can't afford a private therapy so to get one I would have to go to a public clinic (National fund) and they have not the best opinion and I can't make an appointment online, I would have to either call or go there just to find out if they actually could take me. And there's a lot of opinions about people working there that are rude etc so it makes me scared even more. I'm also afraid I won't get proper care because there are so many people, there are long lines to wait and these clinics and hospitals are often underpaid.

Also I'm not from US, I live in Poland and I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. As for now I'm on medication for depression and anxiety but I don't know how much it will help alone.

136,mentalhealth,1,"Advice on delusional sister refusing treatment Hi Friends. My sister has had a psychotic break about 3 weeks ago. She thinks she is the reason trump is being impeached, that she’s behind the uprising in India, and that Russian Spies are out to get her. I suspect Bipolar 1 w/ delusions triggered by stress (she had just started a new job, which she was promptly fired from). 

Problem is, she thinks she’s totally fine. Gets extremely hurt when people don’t believe her and threatens to cut us all out, which she did for a terrifying 4 day period during which she drove 3 states away and appeared at my door step on the other side of the country with no car anymore (abandoned the car and flew.) she refuses treatment, and the mere mention of it right now is enough to almost loose her to ya entirely. She does not seem to be an immediate or clear danger to others- and not her self (not suicidal or anything, and has periods of total lucidity). 

Any advice on how to keep her safe, get her treatment? She also has periods where she thinks she’s a billionaire and is spending money like it too (tipped a server $100 yesterday.) she’s crashing with me for the time being, but can’t stay here forever (i have housemates). 

Thank you all for whatever insight you can offer.",advice delusional sister refusing treatment hi friend sister psychotic break week ago think reason trump impeached s uprising india russian spy suspect bipolar w delusion triggered stress just started new job promptly fired problem think s totally fine get extremely hurt people don t believe threatens cut did terrifying day period drove state away appeared door step country car anymore abandoned car flew refuse treatment mere mention right loose ya entirely doe immediate clear danger self suicidal period total lucidity advice safe treatment period think s billionaire spending money like tipped server yesterday s crashing time t stay forever housemate thank insight offer
137,mentalhealth,1,"Question about trauma and some advice would be nice Okay so my grandfather recently passed away and my reaction has been unexpected. Emotionally, I haven't felt as sad as I should be because I'm close. Due to my history I know that it's not based on having some sort of antisocial disorder, I know very well I can feel empathy and sadness over loss. This isn't to say though that I have been well off mentally afterwards. Instead of feeling sad, I feel anxiety over the events of his passing. When he passed, he was having breathing problems and at first it seemed like he was just having a panic attack. Except as you can tell, it ended up not being the case. He fell to the ground and was taken away by the ambulance and announced dead by the time we got to the hospital. 

What this ended up doing to me was effecting my anxiety and OCD. I always had an innate fear of not being able to breath, I used to be able to take a deep breath to convince myself I'm fine and then relax. After this happened, the need to do this kept coming and coming. I spent days constantly taking deep breaths and panicking every time it wasn't a full deep breath. I did this so much it feels like I strained muscles that are involved with deep breaths to the point I can't even do it at all right now. If I try to take a deep breath I feel a sort of strain that stops it from going all the way. I can't really explain it except to say that I don't have any other symptom such as coughing or even regular breathlessness, it's just an inability to take a deep breath that feels like it's because I've overexerted myself doing it constantly for days on end.

Whenever these episodes were at their strongest, I started thinking of the events surrounding my grandfather and start thinking it's going to happen to me. All the details involved with him come to my head and I start to think something to the effect of ""this is it, it's happening"". I start thinking about how this could effect my mother I look at my cat and get scared that I won't be able to care for her and my anxiety just heightens. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense, if you have any questions I can clarify. But what I wanted to know is first of all, can this trauma block any other emotion mentally? 

And also, am I right to assume my constant deep breathing has made my breathing worse?

Any other advice would be nice, or even replies that relate to this in any way or fashion.",question trauma advice nice okay grandfather recently passed away reaction unexpected emotionally haven t felt sad m close history know s based having sort antisocial disorder know feel empathy sadness loss isn t say mentally instead feeling sad feel anxiety event passing passed having breathing problem like just having panic attack tell ended case fell ground taken away ambulance announced dead time got hospital ended doing effecting anxiety ocd innate fear able breath used able deep breath convince m fine relax happened need kept coming coming spent day constantly taking deep breath panicking time wasn t deep breath did feel like strained muscle involved deep breath point t right try deep breath feel sort strain stop going way t really explain say don t symptom coughing regular breathlessness s just inability deep breath feel like s overexerted doing constantly day end episode strongest started thinking event surrounding grandfather start thinking s going happen detail involved come head start think effect s happening start thinking effect mother look cat scared won t able care anxiety just heightens m sorry doesn t make sense question clarify wanted know trauma block emotion mentally right assume constant deep breathing breathing worse advice nice reply relate way fashion

140,mentalhealth,1,"Bad dreams making my sleep feel less restful Hi everyone! I'm a 25 year old woman. I've had mental health issues for half my life by now. Mostly stress and low energy related complaints. Right now I'm not in any therapy as I've had so much therapy over the last few years that it felt like the same things being repeated over and over, even in intensive fill time group therapies.

One thing that I never considered a huge issue and never really discussed in my therapy sessions is that I have frequent nightmares (almost every night). Well, not really nightmares, more like bad dreams. Things going wrong, mostly mundane but slightly important things (like missing an exam in school, disappointing a loved one, missing a flight, giving a bad concert, being left alone by friends). There's no monsters, noone is dying - but it's always incredibly stressful and I feel more and more like these dreams are a huge contributing factor to two things that are and have always been huge issues (except when I was on sleeping meds): Waking up frequently during the night and being extremely tired and struggling to get up in the morning (in more 'productive' times of my life I've always been a morning person).

One thing that might be important to note is that these things are always related to current events. Like if I have an exam, I can guarantee dreams about it will happen at some point leading up to it. Also, if I read a book or play a game or watch a movie this will almost always come back in these dreams and never in a good way (often I'm in a similar predicament to the antagonist, for example). I wish I could do something about this but I could hardly avoid all forms of entertainment.

I was wondering if this is something others recognize, and what my options are to prevent these bad dreams (or at least how to handle them). Most information online is targeted at full-out nightmares but that's just not the case. But that doesn't mean that these dreams aren't causing me a lot of trouble...

141,mentalhealth,1,"I'm not accomplishing anything in life My days pretty much go like this: I wake up, tired, but force myself to get up and deal with it and try to complete the activities of the day. School helps, because I have to go there - otherwise my attempts to do something productive fail in maybe an hour. I used to be a very studious person, now I'm stuck in a limbo where I'm motivated 10% of the time and after that burst of energy ends I completely lose all the physical and mental energy for anything, motivation flies out the window, I just can't bring myself to do anything - even if I'd want to. 

I have finals and entrance exams for uni really soon, so it's a pivotal point for my future. Doesn't help: I won't pass with just an hour of motivation a day. I want to do so many things in life and I feel like I'm throwing all my time and potential away by loafing around like this. I'm not going anywhere. My whole life has been static for around a year, and every time I try to change something up I lose motivation in a matter of minutes. I'm starting to feel hopeless about my future for not accomplishing anything.

Within a few days of developing feelings for someone, I already want to marry them, I get furious when I find out they are with someone else if they are, I can’t stop thinking about them, and I just want them all to myself. I developed a crush on a guy just after seeing one photo and that instantly made me swoon.

144,mentalhealth,1,"Should I try to be more outgoing/learn how to make more friends? For my school project today, I was forced (Just because I couldn't say no to my teacher) to walk around a shopping district with my group members, and it's a place that I had never been to. I never used to go shopping alone at crowded places and I'm absolutely never an outgoing person. Right at the moment when I was being exposed to huge crowds of people, I suddenly started crying. It just stresses me out to be in a place like that. While trying to hold my tears desperately, the more stressed and anxious i feel, causing me to stare only at the ground while following wherever my group members go by paying attention to their feet. Later that, I tried to calm myself down, telling myself that I'm just overreacting and that this is no big deal at all so I gotta stop acting dumb. But boy I was wrong, I ended up crying again instead of calming down. The people and noises around me, wet eyes and blurred vision, my head stinging, everything just gets more and more unbearable. And so I stayed like that for the whole process until it ends, I was totally worn out both physically and mentally. After my group members walked into a convenience store where there were less people to rest, I sat down and found myself a lot refreshed. (Good thing my group members were distracted and didn't notice me crying and struggling with problems like that) Also, trying to engage in a conversation with them actually made me wanted to stop trying and be alone, I felt like crying but didn't actually did until the moment my group members and I went to the shopping district.

My mood is very up and down, one doctor suggested I may have cyclothymic disorder, which I’m starting to wonder about. Part of the reason I’ve been reluctant to go back on anti-depressants, besides not wanting to be reliant on meds, is because when I feel good I don’t feel like I need them, but then the downs come and they’re getting worse. But I always leave it to see if it will pass which it does and it’s a nasty cycle which is leaving me drained. I make an effort in my social life but I often feel empty and numb, then I feel incredibly depressed, then I feel normal, then happy, and repeat.

147,mentalhealth,1,"Highly sensitive spiritual person gift Background story: all my life I had suffered with what I thought was anxiety and depression, I first came across the term anxiety at the age of 15 and ever since that day I’ve been fascinated by everything to do with the mind , I’m 28 now , at the age of 27 I discovered that I have a highly sensitive personality, I now had full understanding of my entire life and exactly what’s going on in my mind , I always knew I could feel and take on others emotions , I always knew if anyone came to me with a problem of any kind id take it on as if it was mine , I’ve always been able to know exactly what to do to diffuse any situation, I always new I could read every detail about a persons body language in seconds and link everything about them together to come up with one outcome ,
Over the past few years I got extremely deeply intouch with my spiritual side to try and combat all the anxiety , pretty much devoted my life to it , if work was quiet I’d spend the shift researching pretty much anything mind related , I’d get home and watch talks about it on YouTube , read books about it and meditate religiously every night 
I’ve had major success in myself through meditating, I find it easy to distinguish my thoughts and what they truly are . I used to get stuck in the same anxious thought patterns for weeks , now my mind seems to be able to subconsciously pick up on a negative/anxious/depressive thought trains within seconds of it starting , because I know what it is and how it works I can literally choose to remove myself from the thought trail , I managed to full blown feel and talk to my inner child from my higher self , I could feel the entity of it whilst managing to speak to it from a place of serious deep compassion , I’d learnt to completely feel all bad emotion and anxiety inside myself and just letting it be there , learning to do that changed my life immensely, now I found out I have highly sensitive personality I’ve realised it was always the underlying thing causing the majority of my anxiety and it shaped me up to be who I am today , but due to all the mind work I’ve done I now find it very easy to distinguish the thought processes that are just my sensitivity and not get dragged down with them 

I feel like I have a major gift and want to use it to help others 
I regularly get people come up to me with there problems and it hardly takes me any effort at all to work out exactly what’s going on in there mind to cause it , sometimes it actually blows my mind how obvious it is to me and how they can’t see it themselves, but I’ve realised that’s all to do with me being HSP and being able to collect all the smallest of details and merge them together to reach my outcome. 
I seem to be able to say sentences that people are about to say before they’ve even said a thing , on a regular basis I get people say to me ‘ how the F... did you know I was going to say that!?’ 
I can feel the energy of a room of people instantly ,
I can draw the mind , I’ve worked out how certain mind processes work to the point where I can draw a diagram explaining what’s happening in a much easier way for people to understand.
I can draw a picture of the mind seeing/being a thought , I can also draw a picture of the mind observing a passing thought from the conscious.
I feel I know processes of the mind that are either majorly overlooked or are simply not known to others yet
I could ramble on and on about what I’ve noticed I feel and see  compared to the norm

I always knew there was something different about me and I never realised until coming across the term highly sensitive personality that not everyone has these abilities! People around me can see it to

159,mentalhealth,1,"Anxiety is controlling my every thought due to unknown abnormalities found on MRI and I need ways to not focus on whatever is might be As title mentions and my previous posts will show I went for an MRI to rule out possible MS and instead was immediately referred to a Neurologist for unspecified abnormalities.  My current PCP won't elaborate on what that means so anxiety has taken over.

Part of me thinks, Thank goodness, I'm not completely losing my mind amd there is something causing all my symptoms.

The other part of me screams, but what is it?  Is it serious, is it something that can be treated, is it nothing and I'm starting back at square 1 to find the root of my symptoms?  As you can see I can literally keep going with questions.

I know I've been told to wait and let the Neurologist review the findings and to push the thoughts out of my mind as there is nothing to confirm or deny.  If only it was that easy.  Part of my anxiety is obsessive thoughts.  I can't even focus on conversations nor do I want to.  I want to sleep and I want to not handle people.  I want to hide in my room and make no decisions about anything.

163,mentalhealth,1,"I'm inescapably angry all the time about how I was treated in my youth. Sorry if this is rambly, I tried to just get to the point as quick as I could without listing off a ton of specific incidents, more an overview of how I feel.

I have mild tourrete syndrome and in honestly kind of an Aspergers case as well. For most of my childhood everything was ok. Adults didn't really understand my condition fully and it showed at times, there was another kid in my year who I'm pretty sure now was full blown autistic, in the earlier days before he was really struggling to keep up with the class, the teacher wanted me to coach him on coping with his disability, kind of messed up, but whatever.

Until I got to grade 6, before then my teachers showed me respect, I was a straight A student with no record of misbehaving, no reason to give me a hard time. My 6th grade teacher took one look at me and saw a special needs student. At the beginning of the year everybody got to choose their seats, and then a week in he would make tweaks, I got put in the corner of the room with the teacher's aide and two legit special needs kids. 

My school had a traditional program where seniors (6th/7th grade) get to read to the Kindergartners and Grade 1s, everybody would be assigned their own ""little buddy"" and we would get to read to them for like half an hour once a week. I was the only one in class who got excluded because there weren't enough Little Buddies to go around, even though one girl in my class had two little buddies for some reason. He just wrecked my self esteem over and over with mean stunts like that, I got him for Grade 7 as well. 

I went into his classes with Straight As and left with Cs, he threw me into a downward spiral that took a solid decade before I started to show signs of recovery. On the last day of Grade 7 and heading off to High School he told me I was going to be assigned a special needs aide next year to follow me around in each class. That was never true, it was purely out of cruelty that he said that to me.

No teacher in high school was ever as awful to me, but the damage was done. I had no motivation to do anything in school and my grades got worse and worse. I would just sleep in classes, never do my homework, and just barely scrape by with good test scores and make-up assignments during Summer. Every year would be progressively worse, and teachers for some reason just failed to see how ill I was. By grade 11 I was an alcoholic and regularly drinking during classes. In Grade 12 I finally broke halfway through and just dropped out. None of my former friends or classmates knows to this day what actually happened to me. 

I bounced back a bit the following year and graduated through an alternative education program. And then just kind of floundered around for 3 years mostly unemployed and just playing World of Warcraft while being severely depressed. I finally got a full time job at Tim Hortons when I was 22, I went back to school on the side and upgraded all my high school academics. I eventually became manager of the store, and then got headhunted by the CRA to work for the government instead. I know I should be happy with what I've made of myself, but I'm just not.

I'm still damaged, and I am hateful of so much around me in this world. I hate how much hate I have in me all the time. I'm constantly reflecting on my life and who I am and why I am the way I am. There are two people I always remember. The first is my 6th grade teacher, the defining moment in my life where it all went wrong. And my rage just intensifies when I think of it. I can't wrap my head around how awful he is, I wasn't his only victim, how could somebody be that cruel? I can't just move on because I don't accept it, I can't accept that he got away with it.

I often feel like I will never move on until I inevitably publicly confront him and call him out. He does not deserve to have his name unsullied. Wrappin this up, the 2nd person I think of when reflecting on my past was my high school Spanish teacher. She was a really kind person, in my last class with her she gave us all personalized farewell cards. I don't remember most of what she wrote to me, but it opened with ""(Name), I don't understand you..."".

164,mentalhealth,1,"Negative thoughts to the point of suicide Lately I've been having really negative thoughts to the point of considering suicide. 

I don't have a clue why. 

Things seem to be looking up. I got out of my fucking crazy relationship with my abusive ex, I started recording my debut album with my band. I met a fucking fantastic girl who makes me feel things I've never felt before, even when I had been in happy relationships.

But something's sorely missing. I keep feeling so fucking low and angry. The last half hour of college today was really stressful and it put me in such a bad mood. Little things seem to be setting me off and I'm getting so tired of it all. I've been barely sleeping at night, waking up in the middle of the night, unable to sleep anymore.

I feel like I'm making a bigger deal out of it than i should. I feel like i should just get over it. On the surface things seem like they're going well for me. But everything's moving too fucking slow and too fast at the same time. I hate where i live, but i know i wouldn't really be any happier anywhere else and i'm too young and don't have the money to go anywhere else. 

I should be happy. I fucking should be. I have so many reasons to be happy and yet i'm just fucking not. The closest I get to happiness is when I'm around my girlfriend, but we only see each other once or twice every week or so. 

I don't know what to do or who to tell or how to act and its fucking draining me. 

I wouldn't kill myself, but the thought is so tempting sometimes. I know theres no good that could come from it but fuck me i don't want to be here. I'm safe and will remain so but i just want these feelings to go away. I want to feel like me again.

After the session, I wanted so much to go to the nearest pub and drown out what was brought up. I chose not to and looking forward to my next session.

167,mentalhealth,1,"Hallucinations I've been having mild hallucinations for a little over a year now. I'm 19, F, and had been in therapy from the end of Junior year until a little bit into my freshman year of college. When I first got into therapy I had a diagnosis of Cyclothymia and two anxiety disorders, and then they changed my diagnosis to (complex) PTSD. 

I had been going to my guidance counselor for months over my awful mood swings, because they were so intense I would go from so hyper, happy, amped up and wired that I felt fucking amazing, to so miserable I literally wanted to self harm and/or quit breathing just to make it stop, back and forth, like five times a day. I did it twice in a class period and it was such a rapid change in mood it left me exhausted and overwhelmed and tired and sick of feeling how I did. The highs didn't make it worth it when I knew I'd just come crashing down so hard. 

Eventually I started dissociating like really intensely. I felt like I was high on marijuhana before I'd ever even smoked it. Now that I have it felt a lot like that, mixed with being hyper, or sometimes just by itself. I spaced out so much even my boyfriend said I seemed like I was stoned at school and I'd never even touched weed at this point. I couldn't focus enough to hold a conversation at times - I'd forget what I was saying, I'd forget the sentence someone just said to me, I felt floaty, you get the idea.

I started hallucinating, too. It started with dark spots in my vision - but it got worse and worse the more I got worse with my dissociative problem. Theyre both types of psychosis so it makes sense. My therapist told me it was likely due to my severe anxiety - I'm hypervigalent and get chest pains all the time from it even when I feel generally normal. I'm worried I might have something worse than just PTSD though, because the longer I'm off my medication the worse and more frequently they happen. I drove to the nearby city when I wasn't supposed to and my car broke down and I started crying because I was terrified my parents would find out and I full on hallucinated little flecks of light in the top of my vision - almost like embers, but not as round or big and they came and went like shooting stars but smaller and without much of a trail. I see dark spots all the time, including light spots, some are bigger and less opaque, some are smaller and like blotches of darkness - they're really fleeting, they never last more than a few seconds, if that, and when they first started it was maybe a few times a day. Now, it's every day, every hour, usually multiple times an hour. They're not anything severe, because it's just warped versions of light and dark, I'm not seeing like, people or animals or things that aren't real, and I can recognize it as fake, but they're increasing in frequency and I'm worried they're going to increase in severity. Today while I was waiting to talk to a hiring manager for a job I know I'm getting, I hallucinated, but this time it was like a genuine shadow. Normally the shadows I see aren't realistic and are completely out of place, but I saw a shadow all the way across the floor and up part of the wall like the sun came out for a second depsite it being cloudy as fuck - the sun definitely didn't come out. I'm worried I might have something more severe than just anxiety induced hallucinations but I have nothing to compare this to and I don't know exactly what I'm asking. I guess is this similar to the experiences of people who developed more severe disorders? I'm just worried, I've never heard of anyone having so many hallucinations just from anxiety.

At some point I was on Lexapro and Abilify for my anxiety and psychosis. I'd dissociate so hard I'd feel like I could just stick my hand through walls or my bedsheets (but I woildn't try because I knew it was crazy and it'd just snap me out of it really hard). Taking those made my dissociation fade significantly, as well as my hallucinations, and everything else. I certainly don't attribute the medication to my declining mental health. I started them after I began hallucinating too and now that I'm off it makes sense it's getting worse.

I have abusive parents who are manipulating my grandmother so I can't attend therapy or get back on my medication right now, but I have every intention to after I leave for University and live on campus.",hallucination having mild hallucination little year m f therapy end junior year little bit freshman year college got therapy diagnosis cyclothymia anxiety disorder changed diagnosis complex ptsd going guidance counselor month awful mood swing intense hyper happy amped wired felt fucking amazing miserable literally wanted self harm quit breathing just make stop forth like time day did twice class period rapid change mood left exhausted overwhelmed tired sick feeling did high didn t make worth knew d just come crashing hard eventually started dissociating like really intensely felt like high marijuhana d smoked felt lot like mixed hyper just spaced boyfriend said like stoned school d touched weed point couldn t focus hold conversation time d forget saying d forget sentence just said felt floaty idea started hallucinating started dark spot vision got worse worse got worse dissociative problem theyre type psychosis make sense therapist told likely severe anxiety m hypervigalent chest pain time feel generally normal m worried worse just ptsd longer m medication worse frequently happen drove nearby city wasn t supposed car broke started cry terrified parent hallucinated little fleck light vision like ember round big came went like shooting star smaller trail dark spot time including light spot bigger opaque smaller like blotch darkness really fleeting second started maybe time day s day hour usually multiple time hour severe s just warped version light dark m seeing like people animal thing aren t real recognize fake increasing frequency m worried going increase severity today waiting talk hiring manager job know m getting hallucinated time like genuine shadow normally shadow aren t realistic completely place saw shadow way floor wall like sun came second depsite cloudy fuck sun definitely didn t come m worried severe just anxiety induced hallucination compare don t know exactly m asking guess similar experience people developed severe disorder m just worried heard having hallucination just anxiety point lexapro abilify anxiety psychosis d dissociate hard d feel like just stick hand wall bedsheets woildn t try knew crazy d just snap really hard taking dissociation fade significantly hallucination certainly don t attribute medication declining started began hallucinating m make sense s getting worse abusive parent manipulating grandmother t attend therapy medication right intention leave university live campus

Hey im looking to see if theres any professionals on here that could shed some light... i have been diagnosed by a phsycotherapist with ptsd. But on a 8month waiting list for phsychiatrist. Anyways , im 30 , male. Grew up in a severely bad home. 

Age 0 - 3 , bounced back between my grans house and my moms house. Dad beat me with a cast when i was 4.5 i remember this. 

Ages 4 to 11 

Mother had many boyfreinds , would party and do drugs in the house , although i had younger siblings me and my older brother were locked in the bedroom from 3pm till the next morning. Typical school week. When it was the weekend me and my older brother would hide in the closet hole we made behind the dresser because when drunk my mother and her neices and freinds would come into our room , pee on us , throw us into freezing showers , try suffocate us with pillows , and at night when the partys dying out i would hear my brother getting raped and eventually me. This happened for years , and when my mother was bored she would lock me in the cellar crawl space for hours on end with the lights off. with a demonic statue. Which i eventually started to talk to. My other siblings were treated soo good and protected by my mothers sisters exc , and growing up in a small town my mother and her siblings labelled me and my older brother as the towns theives and fuck ups at AGE 11 and 13 but we didnt do any of that , i was molested in school by ms.dueck she was a TA and helped me read because i was assumed to be mute. But my jaw hurt and i was always on edge to focus in school. The teachers knew i was being abused but nothing was done! They even let the other kids , thanks to my aunty val telling the other parents how bad we were bully me and my older brother , i remember i was invited to a birthday party when i was 10 , i shoveled driveways for 2 whole days and hid some of that money minus what my mother took , i baught a wicked birthday present , i walked the logans party which was 2 miles and to be yelled at to F*&amp;^ off by his parents. I was chased with vehicles by other kids in higher grades than me. My moms freind who was gay babysat me and ny older brother , and i wish i wouldhave been babysat by my abusive cousins than this guy, his name was richard a CONVICTED CHILD RAPIST , thats all ill say. 

Then when i was 13 my mother remarried a biker , he was the devil! Also a pedophile but loved to beat the s... out of me and my older brother till i started fighting back , i was fist fighting a grown man who was 6'5 350lbs everyday till i was 18. Including everyone else. I was fine until 2 years ago just after my son was born , my saviour and the light of my life. But the last 2 years ive been having reoccurent thoughts of my son being kidnapped , raped and murdered and me having to bury his little body , this sends me into a furious rage and i begin to have severe anxiety and thoughts of murdering people who even look at him wrong with my bare hands.

174,mentalhealth,1,"a letter to my 12 year old self, on february 17th, 2017 tia,

you are almost 13. you never thought you'd get this far, and you almost didn't. i know things are hard right now, it has been exactly one month since you saw your mum. i hate to say it, but it will be a very, very long time until you see her again.

life has been absolute shit. you have anorexia nervosa now, and an addiction to meth. you hear voices sometimes too, and 50% of the time you don't even feel like yourself, you feel like a completely different person. the summer after your suicide attempt (good news, it failed) you had a flashback of your mum when you looked in your bathroom mirror so you cut off all your hair and tried to change your name to something with no familial attatchment. then, to make things worse, you got adopted. it was terrible, and you were high the whole day.

you can no longer be used as a sacrafice anymore though, you lost your virginity. that's kind of cool, even though you lost it because the person promised you drugs in return. how could you ever turn that down? during your overdose you somehow managed to smoke your first cigarette out of your bedroom window, it was the closest to heaven you had ever felt. you will smoke many more in the years to come. you opened up quite a bit, not emotionally though. you opened up physically.

your body was less of a temple and more of a motel. a tiny, afraid, underweight motel. you remember almost nothing from when you were 13. your cat also died, and it sucked because you started to like her more than most people. your other cat is still alive, but she's not much like herself. she's old and has dementia. she'll still give you kisses and purr when you hold her though. your grades decline A LOT by the way, it causes a lot of issues for you.

your room triggers you, you hate things touching your body, you cry more often than you let on, you barely leave the house, and you hate yourself more than anything. your life got fucked up because you decided it was a good idea to try meth. it ended with 8 months in a lockdown rehabilitation facility where you were emotionally drained the entire time. you did break the law (twice) and punch a man in the ear while you were there though, that's always a fun story to tell.

yeah, life is still kinda shit. and i hate to break it to you but this will not be your last suicide attempt, you'll try at least 4 more times before you finally give up in a good way.

last year you finally came out as lesbian. you've brought your grades up quite a bit too, and your aunt and uncle are really proud. you don't really care because you feel like it isn't good enough, but either way improvement is always good. you have almost 2 years clean off of meth, which is fucking epic, bro. yeah, rehab gave you some ptsd but at least it helped you clean up your act a bit. you're much less of a pussy now, you sneak out all the time and you always get away with it. you smoke weed with people you never thought you'd get high with, the people who don't want you getting high. it's nice.

my dude, you also get yourself a girlfriend. she is the most beautiful thing on the planet, i can't wait for you to see her in real life, it changes everything. she has bullied you into loving her by always being pretty and smart and caring and sweet. it is bullshit, don't let anyone else do that to you. anyways, she and i/you will be together for 2 years in early march. hell yeah.

in other cool news, there's this really fuckin cool kid who lives down the street. y'all meet at therapy, and now you're best friends. she is by far, the best friend you've ever had, and one of your most favourite people on earth. which is underrstandable, because she's hella pretty and nice and funny and epic. be friends with her for a long time, i will be so mad if i fuck this one up.

like, fuck yeah things suck but bro you have never been so ok either. i wish things were better, but i've learned to settle with ok. it getss better dude, when you wake up you'll be absolutely miserable and sick and tired and afraid, it is by far one of the worst things you'll ever feel. but it doesn't last. nothing does, so just chill out because this is just the tip of the iceberg. it only goes downhill from here.

and then it goes uphill. then things are finally worth it, i promise.

175,mentalhealth,1,"[Advice] Take a vacation from yourself! Here is something I sometimes use, when I just need an evening off from my constant overthinking.

When I have a night out that doesn't involve social interaction with people that know me (cinema, theatre, meetup, concert), I try take a vacation from myself to rest my spirit.

What that means is, I see myself as a person without a past, no memories of mistakes, no missing skills, no screwed up possibilities. Just a person that I know nothing of except for what I see in this very moment.

And I confirm that this person has a right to enjoy themself.

Any guilty thought that pops up, any cringe about my past has to be violently pushed back and denied from being thought about, because THAT'S AGAINST THE RULES!

After a while I always get into an extremely great mood.

177,mentalhealth,1,"venting.. I don't know what I want to accomplish by posting here, I've just been feeling like garbage and need to get it out to people who don't know me or expect anything of me, lol. This won't be interesting to read.

I live in Australia, known for being on fire. I'm 25 and was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 14. If you had told me then that I would still be suicidal more than 10 years from then, I don't know if I would have been willing to keep on going. And the thought of another 10 years like this makes me feel so depressed I don't know what to do. I can count the periods of my life since then where I *wasn't* wicked depressed on one hand. And it's stupid, because it's not like I've had any particular struggles. I was diagnosed with ASD at 20 (late, I know), graduated school and moved to a nice city for a reasonably well-paying, entry level, year-long contract in my field at 22. While I was living apart from them my parents split up, but I was already an adult, so.

At 24 I moved back to my hometown for a job that I'd been verbally assured of for the next year - there would be a month of training with several other applicants, and out of them three of us would be hired (so, I thought, me and two others). Two weeks into the training the manager took me aside and told me the guarantee was being rescinded as my performance wasn't what they were expecting (in their words, my demo reel \[I'm an animator\] ""was misleading"". obviously it was all my work lol). I had moved cities at pretty significant expense (animators aren't known for their high salaries), from somewhere with much more opportunity, and felt pretty winded by this - obviously if I had been told ""come here for a month and maybe you'll get hired"", I would have made pretty different plans. Instead of staying for another two weeks to pretty likely get rejected again, I left for a three-month freelance thing, and have been jumping from gig to gig ever since - longer-term positions in animation in my hometown are pretty hard to come by. At the moment I'm working from home, and money is really really tight as hours are pretty hard to nail down when you're working freelance.

After what happened with that studio, I was feeling pretty destabilised and negative about my future in this industry, so I've started studying another discipline part time, online. But I'm finding it very difficult to balance freelancing from home (right now on two separate projects), keeping my life moving w/ cooking, cleaning and all, and study, and my grades aren't good at all, although I know I have ability - I get excellent grades on work I turn in, but other assessments I fail just by nonsubmission because I can't make myself complete them.

My motivation is completely shot. I'm exhausted all the time and cry for no reason every day. I've done everything everyone tells me to - I eat really healthily, almost all food I cook myself, I work out, I have a cat, I make time to see my family and friends, I take my medication every day, I drink plenty of water. (I have PCOS and hypothyroidism, but my doctor won't consider putting me on thyroid medication, so I just try to mitigate what I can with good diet and exercise). I went to a psychiatrist and he just told me to get off my antidepressants and lectured me about big pharma. I've seen lots of psychologists over the last 10 years and faithfully do my mindfulness exercises and interrogate my thoughts for their usefulness and fairness. But I still have anxiety attacks several times a week. I just don't know what to do. I feel overwhelmed by living in the world and by my own uselessness. I feel completely worthless and unequal to my life, even my relatively easy, safe life. I'm always scrambling just to stay afloat. The world just seems black, I can't see any future.

178,mentalhealth,1,"Extremely depressed after being flirted with I (20m) never exactly hit it off well with the ladies when I was younger. I've never been kissed and I'm a virgin, the only relationships I've ever had were the fake middle school kind where you ""date"" for a week and then never really talk again. That being said, 2019 was a really transformative year for me where I feel I've kinda become my own man so to speak. I'm not as introverted as I used to be, exercise and late stage puberty helped me feel less undesirable, and I've been clean from self harm for over a year now... My mental health isn't perfect but it's much better than it was.

With the context out of the way, I legitimately cannot mentally handle being flirted with. I can keep my composure on the spot and sometimes even flirt back, but mentally I break down within half an hour after this kind of exchange. I want to enjoy the feeling of someone expressing interest in me and know what it's like to be excited with ""butterflies"" or whatever people actually feel, but instead I'm overcome with extreme depression the I cannot explain or rationalize at all.

Maybe this is more of a rant than anything else but I guess I'm just kinda pissed I don't get to experience (what I imagine is) one of the most beautiful parts of the human experience.

184,mentalhealth,1,"I am overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. I have a history of depression through my teen years. I mostly overcame a lot of my problems through therapy and medication. I also struggled with alcohol for a while and stopped drinking little over a year ago. 

For the last three months I have been feeling incredibly depressed, anxious, overwhelmed by work and alone. It has now reached a point that I find myself considering drastic options: from dropping out of university to potentially killing myself. I don't want to do either of these things, but I feel for the first time in a very long time that I am completely out of control of my environment and that I cannot help myself. I am at a crisis point. I can't eat, sleep, work or anything. 

I am a graduate student, in a fairly high pressure environment at a new university. I do not live on campus and spend most of my free time working a part time job. Everyone on my course is very nice but due to my circumstances, I have no friends. I live with my partner, who is foreign, and due to visa issues will be leaving the country soon. This will leave me geographically and emotionally alone. I cannot speak to my family about my problems as they are very demanding and often not very sympathetic. They also blame my partner for my personal woes and claim she has 'ruined my opportunities' due to her visa situation. I stayed with them for a week over the holidays and only had rows and felt worse. 

I am very stressed by my university work. I am usually fine with this, but have recently been overwhelmed with a sense that I am not good enough, that I cannot meet expectations of my supervisor and effectively that I am destined now to fail. My university doesn't give me grades on individual pieces of work and there is strict limit on the academic support I am allowed to receive, so I have no idea how I am doing, but can only judge based on my own (low) opinion of myself. This is reflected by the fact that I don't really know what I'm doing with upcoming assignments and every time I look for academic advice it is no help. 

The depression paralyses me from doing anything and as a result all aspects of my life worsen. As a result of this, my depression worsens. I have tried getting counselling or seeing a doctor but waiting times are horrendous. I don't know what to do. My degree is for the next five months and I know I cannot live like this for five months, but also I want to get my degree (even if I barely pass). At the same time, I am so miserable - as a consequence of my family life, my partner having to leave, my own self-disappointment and a lack of a support system - that I feel like I don't have many options left. I want to drink again but I know I can't do that.

I know I need help or advice but I don't know who can give it to me and how I can articulate myself to get that help. My academic tutors are not particularly empathetic - nether are my family and friends - and the only person who can support me emotionally will soon be in another continent. 

I just needed to get this off my chest and see if there is any advice. Thanks.",overwhelmed don t know history depression teen year overcame lot problem therapy medication struggled alcohol stopped drinking little year ago month feeling incredibly depressed anxious overwhelmed work reached point considering drastic option dropping university potentially killing don t want thing feel time long time completely control environment help crisis point t eat sleep work graduate student fairly high pressure environment new university live campus spend free time working time job course nice circumstance friend live partner foreign visa issue leaving country soon leave geographically emotionally speak family problem demanding sympathetic blame partner personal woe claim ruined opportunity visa situation stayed week holiday row felt worse stressed university work usually fine recently overwhelmed sense good meet expectation supervisor effectively destined fail university doesn t grade individual piece work strict limit academic support allowed receive idea doing judge based low opinion reflected fact don t really know m doing upcoming assignment time look academic advice help depression paralysis doing result aspect life worsen result depression worsens tried getting counselling seeing doctor waiting time horrendous don t know degree month know live like month want degree barely pas time miserable consequence family life partner having leave self disappointment lack support feel like don t option left want drink know t know need help advice don t know articulate help academic tutor particularly empathetic nether family friend person support emotionally soon continent just needed chest advice thanks
185,mentalhealth,1,"I feel worthless I keep getting ignored. It infuriates me because it KEEPS HAPPENING. Everyone from old friends, family, and even new people I message. It really makes me feel like raging. If this keeps up, I won't be able to contain my depression and anger anymore. The people that will talk to me don't offer much in terms of a conversation, even with my excessive efforts to carry the conversation. They're simply incapable of transcribing their thoughts to text.
   I'm a lonely person. My health is deteriorating. I do just enough to maintain my body so I'm not miserable. I just want to feel like I have a chance to find love or even an unwavering faithful companion. These days, life is becoming a major chore with no compensation. I get no benefits for taking care of myself. Where is the hope I need to continue fighting the loneliness?
   I long for connection to another human being. At the same time, I'm growing colder to everyone and I want to turn violent. Let's see how much I get ignored then. But I don't want to my life to end or the quality of it suffer because people don't want to acknowledge my messages or give me a moment of their time. I have so much to offer. BUT I DON'T EVEN GET THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE TO CHANGE SOMEONE'S MIND. It has almost entirely shifted my self image.
   I used to be happier until I realized that I'm an unapproachable, unappealing, insignificant piece of trash. I cheated on my last serious girlfriend when we were in high school and I gave up on dating or being with someone(by choice) because I burned with remorse. I became content with working on myself, making sure I didn't hurt someone like that again.
   Some years passed, and I decided that I had punished myself and grew enough, that it was time to start looking for a potential mate. Since then, I haven't had anything close to a girlfriend. It's been almost ten years since we broke up and about 7 years since I got back on the horse. This is starting to look like concrete evidence that I'm not worthy of anyone's time. I will probably get pity comments saying contrary, but nothing will change. People will continue to perceive me as something to avoid at all costs.
   What can I do? Is this what it's like trying to date during your twenties? Am I just that ugly? Are skinny people hated? I literally have no clue how to feel better about being so low on the totem pole. 
   That's just my love life, my ex best friend of 10 plus years was the most toxic, manipulative person I've ever met. He ruined my reputation just because we were friends. I couldn't ever perceive the situation from the outside looking in until we had our final falling out. By that time it was too late. Now everyone associates me with him and they probably think I'm a heartless heathen 😭😭 plus who knows what he's been saying about me 😭😭😭 
   This happened somewhat recently and lead me to a deep depression which lead to a severe decrease of my health. It got to the point where I couldn't even walk to my kitchen and fix something to eat without my body trying to shut down from malnutrition. I started eating about a week ago. I don't feel or look as healthy as I did before, but I can actually get up and move around a lot more than before. I have an appetite, a potential job interview coming up, and people that do care about me, but my body craves something more than they can give me.
   I want a best friend. I want to be desired as a mate. I just want to feel like I have a purpose. And with so much strife happening in my life, that throws out any, if not all, possibility of a mate considering me as a candidate until I get my life straightened out. Which, when my life was optimal, the chances were already slim to none. The people that were drawn to me had ulterior motives. They didn't want me for me. 
   Anyways, venting my frustrations have helped me calm down, but I have no direction of what to do next. If you want to help, feel free to ask questions or give advice. That's probably gonna be the most interaction I get from another person if this post doesn't get ignored too.

I have one friend, and lately every interaction with him has gone poorly. I either end up being a depressed mess worried that I keep annoying him in some way and trying my best to avoid angering him, which only serves to actually annoy and anger him, or I end up feeling really angry and pissed off and getting in fights with him. The worst part is that I don't get that way when I interact with my parents. 

I fear that if this keeps up I'll simply drive him away, and we won't be friends anymore. I don't want this. He has been a good support over the years, and is a great friend. I don't know what to do though. 

Last we spoke, I had gotten depressed and told him I would leave him be and not talk to him for a few days, so as to avoid bothering him. For added context, we both live in the same town, and have meet in person many times, but haven't done so in a long while, so this is all over text or some other chatting thing.

The thing that pisses me the fuck off is a guy there with a gambling addiction and they can ""help"" him...I was told there is nothing they can help me with. That guy's addiction and my addiction are in the same fucking category of Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders!!!! It is the SAME kind of addiction as the alcoholics (I am one, ironically, but I have been sober for 3 years so that isn't my issue) and drug addicts. I understand they want to be ""safe"" but I have not EVER shown that I am a danger and I even voluntarily gave up my lighter and had no problem doing so every time I visited. I would even NOT have it on me if it came down to that because getting help is much more important to me than being comfortable having the lighter on me.

I am being discriminated against (the one lady submitted a contract to her boss -- kind of like a safety contract for me, but she said I can't come in there now until they ""discuss"" it) and it hurt me to the core and made me feel like a piece of shit. I told the lady to fuck herself.

At this point, even if they say it is OK...I will tell them to fuck themselves (in those words too) because they are lucky I don't hire a lawyer and go after them. I don't have the time, nor the money, nor the confidence that I would win (and honestly, I don't give a shit anymore now anyhow) to even consider going to a lawyer to sue for discrimination, so fuck this. I want to burn down the fucking building, but of course that would be stupid and I can easily stop myself from doing something that drastic. I wouldn't dare do that anyhow. I don't like torching buildings myself (just paper, wood, junk, and Dumpsters...sigh) because I just can't bring myself to do it, even as strong as my urges are--they don't push me to do that, thank God for that. I like to watch the flames during a house fire, but even that is tainted by the sympathy I feel for the people whose lives are fucked because of a fire.

Then to make my day even MORE fucked, I had police contact today on the way home. I was already pissed off, and I was just sitting outside waiting for the bus (I was sitting on the one side of the building where the bus stop is because the wind was strong and the building blocked it mostly) and I guess I was there for a while because all of a sudden, a cop car made a U-Turn (HAHAH illegally lol) and stopped on the corner. I saw him turn and said ""fuck me..."" because I knew he was gonna stop. I wasn't in trouble because I was just sitting, trying to stay warm. It was extremely cold and windy, so I looked like I was homeless (we are just one tiny step up from homeless right now and struggling to hang on by a thread) so he was just checking on me to make sure I was OK. He had the greatest British accent lol...and he was kinda good-looking...not that I noticed or anything ahahahaha. I still have to report that to my Probation Officer. I left a message (called as soon as I got home), and I actually see her tomorrow, so it's all good. I think I have 24 hours to report police contact and this wasn't anything serious so phew.

I got $2 from some caring person passing by...sigh. People are really assholes. I wasn't outwardly begging for money (even though it isn't illegal to ask for money as long as you aren't being aggressive or stopping traffic) but damn...I was grateful for that couple dollars, which I gave to my hubby so he can get gas for the car to get to the bank tomorrow.

Please don't judge me or give me shit about being on the streets...I am doing what I have to until our money comes in (SSI for the 3 boys) at the end of the month. I don't get my money (Disability) until March 3, so it will be fine after that. We are just struggling at the moment. I would NEVER go as far as prostituting myself---I definitely draw a HARD line at that!!!!

And before you say it--yes, we have asked for help and have received food, etc. but with 4 kids at home to feed, what little food we get (I am THANKFUL for everything) has to stretch to breaking. My hubby and I go hungry at night. Thankfully, I get food at the Counseling Center (lunch) and the kids get free breakfast and lunch at school. Hubby also makes due with what we have but often doesn't eat all day. I am not looking for pity, ok? It is what it is, and things are going to get better.

I guess that is why I am so fucking PISSED at this Recovery Bank discrimination--they were the ones helping us with food!!! I have some calls in, so hopefully we can get what we need elsewhere. I know there are food banks and stuff, but we already got food this month from a lot of them. They absolutely help, and again, I am grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this is a book. :( I just needed to vent. We are getting minimal food stamps for now, but that is going to stop in March when I get my checks again because we will make just about $100 too much. Then again, we will have all that extra money (from my check) coming in, so it balances itself out nicely.

Grrrrrrrr. Fucking hell. Thanks for reminding me yet AGAIN that I am a fucking ""dangerous"" person, though I haven't done ANYTHING (at any of the programs I go to) to show that I am a danger. I am a danger just by virtue of being a fucking pyromaniac.

If I didn't have family--I would SO fucking end my lousy existence once and for all. I have a loving and supportive family so that is enough to keep me here. Plus I REALLY like the Partial Hospitalization Program (at the Counseling Center) too. It is really beneficial and I don't have to pretend to be someone I am not when I am there, unlike when I go out into public.

196,mentalhealth,1,"Being watched??? Alrighty. For my first post imma talk about this weird feeling I have literally 24/7. First of all, I fucking hate it. Anyways, so all the time I have this feeling that I’m being watched??? This feeling has been persistent for about 6years now I think. I don’t really remember when it started.  And it’s not that anxious feeling you get like in public where a stranger might be watching you or something creepy, it’s like, people I know, the people change over time as they come and go irl but it feels like people I look up to or want to impress or just don’t want to disappoint are watching me. Like, when I’m laying down, when I shower, use the restroom, walk, in class at school or just doing anything. It kinda feels like I’m always putting on a performance because of this, always perfect posture when I walk, never slouching or laying down on the couch in an unflattering way, never eating food messily or impolitely even when I’m alone. Because the people are watching me. I know no ones actually watching me cause the technology my mind makes up to make such things happen don’t actually exist that I know of. I thought that maybe this is what being paranoid is so I googled it (I know I know, not the best method of research) but all the symptoms aren’t it. It says symptoms of PPD are things like being quick to anger, defensive, and thinking that people are going to hurt you. I’ve never felt that someone would hurt me, not even strangers on the street! And I’ve never just been quick to anger with people unless they straight up do some wack shit like continue talking to me when I’ve said to stop, standing too close or touching when I’ve repeatedly said to stop or just straight up being a dick/homophobic/sexist.

197,mentalhealth,1,"Had an uncanny moment when doing eye contact meditation with a girl with ASPD. So I dated a girl a few months ago, who for all intents and purposes was an awesome dating experience for me; she was a beautiful, smart, inspiring Philipino girl who expressed after our second date that she didnt want to exclusively date me, but rather a fwb type ordeal, so I decided to stop having any hope for exclusivity and simply chose to indulge in the fwb and enjoy it while it lasted. She relatively early on(a month of hanging out all throughout the week) expressed that she loved me(and often), and would pay for a grand majority of our dates  She had no qualms about buying me clothes(she would propose it if we walked past clothes sections whenever we went to Target); she spoiled me with affection, sex and financial security. Randomly, she would bring up the idea of whether or not she should(literally asking herself out loud, in front of me) exclusively date me, but ultimately deciding each time that she didn't want to commit(She would ask herself as a rhetorical question, out loud). That didnt stop us from looking like a couple in every way shape and form. She called me ""babe"" and always told me she loved me and would try to make me feel special compared to a gym trainer she was also dating(she would share this with me, without me inquiring about it).

I cant explain exactly why, buy I couldnt help but feel so strongly in my gut that she was using me somehow(an intuition I suppose) but i kept rationalizing things with, ""well, why would she; she spoils me rotten and asks for nothing in return other than sex and dates which she funds"". She encouraged me to go to school to better myself, but at the same time, she had little emotional support for me; if I was going through a depression episode(I'm diagnosed with major depression) she had little compassion or empathy for me not being able to willpower through it during low points. She expressed that she has Antisocial Personality Disorder, as a means of apparently trying to relate to me.

One day I ask if she'd be up for doing a meditative practice with me(I regularly practice meditation; I was curious about an eye contact variation of it and did it with two other people), where I set a 5 minute timer and we sit in front of each other and maintain eye contact with one another. She had no problem maintaining eye contact with me, which i found surprising, because my prior ""eye contact"" participants could hardly do so without frequent bouts of laughter or noticeable nervous unease. At one point, I noticed a moment that really stood out to me, which I found uncanny. For only a few seconds, the muscles around her eyes seemed to fully relax and those eyes which once illusively held emotional expression now appeared as mere fleshy pinholes pointed at me. Sort of like her face was merely a mask that for a brief moment, faltered and I happened to spot it.

199,mentalhealth,1,"I feel like I'm rotting from the inside Hi first time posting hoping to find a little clarity, I'm typically not the type to reach out for help and when I do my girlfriend and close friends usually give me the clarity needed, but with this current situation I believe multiple points of view would help.

I (18m) live with my girlfriend of 8 months and have a wonderful relationship as a whole as well as living together comes easy. I work as a carpenter making 18 an hour, not good but not bad for fresh out of highschool. I've typically always dealt with suicidal thoughts, and nihilism but was never medicated nor have I seen anyone, I personally dont like the idea of meds as i self medicated for a while (I understand its different) and always found the same conclusion being strength in myself and self sufficiency. As of recent I havnt had any major depressive episodes or anything of the like but life has gotten stressful. I found myself 2k in debt, a major medical situation arose with my girlfriend which also effects me personally. 

Now that the info is over here's my main issues I'm seeking advice on:

1. I have a terrible desire to invade my girlfriends privacy, earlier in our relationship that showed as checking her phone, but after being blatantly told that was totally uncool I stopped and was proud of myself. To be honest until i met her i never saw stuff like that as toxic as I've never understood the concept of privacy nor have i ever had any growing up which always gave me the mindset of privacy = hiding something. For about 4 months now I've switched my views and have respected my girlfriends privacy although I dont understand it. Now the issue with it is I dont think shes cheated, nor am I doing it out of curiosity its simply I liked knowing what was going on and understanding her from her personal point of view. I still will find myself up late at night fighting the extreme urges to check her phone, I always prevail but it leaves me unfulfilled in a sense, almost empty like I'm missing something (I'm very much the type that likes to know everything and figure people out, how they think etc.) because of that I end up hating myself for dealing with these temptations because they arnt anxiety or self esteem moreso I'm just fucked up and awful and I deeply feel the need to invade privacy for my own selfish gain.

My second issue as of late is the more pressing one, I feel like a complete failure, my own confidence ive always rellied on tells me ""thats ridiculous you're 18 with a house, a dog, a cat, food on the table, a vehicle you own, a wonderful girlfriend, good musical talent, good looks, good ethic, and good maturity for your age"" but for some reason I feel like I'm always failing, not being good enough to my girlfriend after 1 slip up, being a employee for working 40 hours instead of 50, being a bad man of the house for coming in a little short on cash and we have to eat ramen, etc. This has been rotting me out from the inside I only sleep 3 hour nights, those 3 hours I have hellish nightmares, I lay in bed despising myself, my psychosis relapsed and I find myself crying wanting the hell to end wondering why I'm so fucked up yet doing so well. For example here's the dream I had last night taken from my dream journal:

""Last night I fell asleep at 3 woke up at 7 those 4 hours were spent in nightmares of me wading through rivers and oceans of my deceased offspring, they all called out asking why I created them with my fucked up genes and why I'd create atrocities, they all were spiting me for having part of me in them, and I tried to help them, and my girlfriend but I failed everytime, they all despised me and I was trying my hardest, every moment of existing there was pain and I felt it I wanted nothing else but to die yet I wanted to help my children,  and my girlfriend.  They castrated me saying it would rid the world of my seed, and that anything that sprouted from it would have myself in them and would suffer eternally because of it. I was paralyzed all I could do was stand and watch as these thousands of babies were tormented internally the same way I was, they were throwing themselves off cliffs, gouging at each other, anything to die but they all failed""

I'm honestly looking for clarity or really just other peoples opinions on this.

I should disclaim:
-This is not making me suicidal
-I want to see a doc but I have little money and no insurance 
-My mind is typically dark and extreme dreams, thoughts, or episodes of psychosis in which I witness such as above are not uncommon yet I felt like that one had meaning

201,mentalhealth,1,"I know something was wrong with my childhood, but I can't remember anything specific I'm currently in therapy after experiencing rape and being in an abusive relationship (two separate people). My therapist and I have discussed that I entered these relationships because I felt that I deserved to be treated that way or was already used to being treated badly. She suggested that this may have come from my family. I've always thought my family was relatively normal and healthy, but looking back I'm starting to notice some things that were off. 

I tried running away as a child at least three times, from ages 9-12. I first started thinking about self-harming when I was 12, then actually started doing it when I was 15. 15 was when I first started considering suicide, though I didn't attempt it until 20, which was after the rape and abusive relationship. At a very young age, around 7-8, I really enjoyed drawing violent gory images and showing them to other kids, because I thought it was funny how uncomfortable it made them. I remember experiencing intense anger at my younger brothers, to the point where I imagined, in gruesome detail, how I would like to kill them. I took pleasure in imagining this and it provided some relief for my anger. I had a friend who gave me a stick that they carved into a knife, and one day I got so angry at my youngest brother that I actually stabbed him. (the ""blade"" wasn't even an inch long, it was just a cone-shaped point on the end. but it did draw blood). 

If I heard of another child doing these things, I'd think it was definitely a psychopath in the making. But I'm 21 now and I would never want to hurt anyone. I never intentionally hurt animals or people (besides my brother). I was raped at age 17 and in an abusive relationship from 18-20. The past few years have been very cold, lonely, and numb. 

It's clear to me that something was wrong with me as a child. Something must have happened or been wrong in my family that made me so angry. The two biggest themes of my childhood are loneliness and anger. I never had good self-esteem, never had many friends, was always shy and quiet. I just can't think of any specific reason that would've caused that, and it's really bothering me.

209,mentalhealth,1,"Emotional changes upon full brain development From the time I was about 16 until 25 I experienced nearly daily emotional swings- from elation to extreme depression.

And also kind of miss some of the depression;  at least I was feeling something.

215,mentalhealth,1,"never really recovered, feeling lost I’m sorry if this wasn’t an appropriate sub to do this...

throwaway because my actual u/ is recognizable. I also apologize in advance that I’m going to explain a lot and it’s going to be really long, but this will be the first time I’ve ever told the entire story to someone, and I just need to do it. 

In April 2018, I [20F at the time] was at a university event with a ton of people that I knew and that knew me very well. I had just broken up with my boyfriend of almost a year, but we were still figuring out what breaking up looked like, because I was his first girlfriend, and it was generally a weird time. Anyway, so at this event, there was a guy who was 4(ish) years older than me who I didn’t know. He took an interest in me and it was sweet at first, as I had not really been hit on for over a year since being in the relationship. It very quickly became very uncomfortable. In pretty much every photo from that event, it looks normal, but I know that his hand was up my dress behind the scenes. He tried to kiss me against a wall at one point during the night but I pushed him off and ignored his advances for the rest of the first half of the night. 

Later on that night, my roommate who was also at the event and I invited a group of our friends back to our house to drink and wind down the night closer to home. I didn’t know until we were already at my house that someone that my roommate had invited had driven the guy to and from the event, and so he showed up at my house. He was one of my roommates friends, which I also didn’t know until this point. I didn’t want to be rude and cause a scene, so I didn’t say anything. I made a point to sit in our armchair, so he couldn’t sit next to me, and also positioned the chair on the complete opposite side of the room, with the large, circular coffee table between us (this is important). Cut a long story slightly shorter, I ended up getting way more drunk than I intended to, more than I originally thought I was at the time. 

By this point in the night, our other friends had mostly begin to filter out and go home. After saying goodbye to them, there was my roommate, me, the guy and his ride from earlier left in the house. My roommate went to the bathroom and I’m not sure where the ride went. I went to get up to put my glass in the sink in the kitchen, and in order to do so I had to walk around the coffee table. I don’t really know why I didn’t walk around all the couches, if I had maybe none of this would’ve happened. I hate myself for that. When I did this, I had my glass in one hand and my phone in the other. As I walked around, he told me to come sit with him, and I said “no, I’m going to the kitchen” he said something else, then reached up and grabbed my hand that was holding my phone and pulled me down into his lap. I remember trying to get up and not being able to, dropping the glass onto the couch, and him putting my phone out of reach.

Apparently by this point, my roommate and the ride saw this, me on top of his lap, and decided that it was consensual, since I’d just broken up with my boyfriend and they’d seen him flirting with me beforehand. She also claims that she had asked me how I felt about him earlier in the night and I laughed but didn’t say anything, but I don’t remember this. Ultimately, my roommate and the ride decided not to intervene and the ride drove home and left the guy with me, and my roommate went to bed. 

The last thing I remember that night is being guided or carried into my room and the door slamming behind me. I remember also feeling overpowered and scared, because he was extremely tall, especially by my standards (I’m above 5’10 for reference without specificity). When I “came to” I was shaking uncontrollably in bed around 7/8am the next morning. I rolled over and someone was in bed next to me. I thought perhaps my roommate had left the door unlocked and my ex-boyfriend had come over to try and talk, found that I was too drunk and decided to stay. I checked my phone first for evidence of that, and of course there was nothing. Then I finally saw his face and realized what was going on. Panic set in, and there’s a lot of blanks after this too. I remember that he woke up like nothing was wrong and asked if I’d give him a ride home. I didn’t really know how to respond to that because I’ve never been good with confrontation. I took him home. As soon as he got out of my car, I broke down. I had the worst panic attack I’d ever had in the parking lot adjacent to his house. I was probably there for more than an hour, because I remember I didn’t get home until after noon. 

I tried to talk to my roommate about what happened, and we ended up falling out as friends because she didn’t believe I would dare to accuse one of her friends of rape because she’d seen me sitting on his lap, which she took was being consensual. I don’t necessarily agree with that, but I honestly wasn’t in the right state of mind to argue with her over something I couldn’t remember or even begin to explain. She accused me of calling it rape to cover up me cheating on my boyfriend, but I hadn’t told her that we’d broken up already and wouldn’t believe me after I told her. So we cut our losses, moved out and moved on.

Honestly? I [now 23 at the time of this post] don’t know if this is actually rape. I’ll let you all answer that for me, I guess. But since then, I’m damaged. I was a victim of domestic abuse/violence two years before this happened, and the year in between I was drugged at a party and would’ve put money on me dying (but thankfully was well taken care of by kind strangers who have since become friends). The culmination of all of these things affects me every day. I’ve never had therapy, because my family does not believe in it, and even if they did approve, I couldn’t afford it. I can’t maintain or even desire being in a relationship, having sex is terrifying but I do it to make the other person happy and hope that one day I’ll just have sex and I won’t be scared anymore. I can’t make even the most basic decisions by myself, I always require reassurance or someone else to decide for me, because I guess I feel like all of my past decisions have led to trauma. I have flashbacks and random panic attacks  while out with friends, and now it’s affecting me at work due to what I do (ironically, therapy.) 

Any kind of advice or help you can offer me or even just talking to me would help at this point. I’m consistently sitting on the edge just waiting for the next traumatic thing to happen.

216,mentalhealth,1,"When I get too sad, I become a different person. What's wrong with me? I should preface this by saying that I'm formally diagnosed with MDD and GAD, and my doctor theorizes I have BPD, although I'm not sure about that. I have some symptoms that might indicate ADD/ADHD (for those who don't know, ADD/ADHD and BPD can be easily mistaken for each other). I currently can't see anyone to get a diagnosis, so I'm confused if this is a BPD thing, or something else.

Whenever I get too sad, I feel myself become someone else. It has to be the full-on, silently crying, “I want to die” kind of sad, but if I get stuck in that feeling for too long, I change. I become agitated, impulsive, and full-on misanthropic. It's like something snaps inside me and there's a very sudden change. I have to avoid people in that state because otherwise I intentionally start very aggressive arguments, I have elaborate violent thoughts/urges, and I become incredibly bitter. I say things I don't mean, and have really messed up thoughts I usually wouldn't entertain. I have on occasion watched (and enjoyed) snuff videos in this state. I can't talk to anyone when I'm like this because I'll have nothing positive to say at all. I can barely contain myself, it's an effort not to just explode. I've acted violently in the past because of this, and whenever someone provokes me (intentionally or not) I fly off the handle.

Needless to say, I absolutely hate who I am when this mood strikes. It's always because I'm in pain, but that's no excuse. I guess I just want to know if anyone else knows what this is like or what this is. It's out of character for me and I'm not like this often.

222,mentalhealth,1,"Likelihood of Recovery I was put on Psych meds at 19 (I'm now 31) after a panic attack.

The meds were prescribed by the family GP and he didn't monitor me on them.  Fast forward 5 years and they stopped working so he prescribed me another one.

I suffer from Chronic Fatigue after a bout of Glandular Fever that I never fully recovered from. I thought the meds might be contributing to the fatigue so I weaned off early 2018.

The withdrawals were very tough so I went to a Psychiatrist and he prescribed me another med + an antipsychotic at a low dose to help with my trouble sleeping. I had a terrible reaction and developed Akathisia. It sent me into a month long spiral of terror and involuntary movements.

I stopped taking the meds and refuse to take anymore because Akathisia was the most indescribable terror I have ever experienced, worse than any panic attack or depressive episode.

Ever since then I have what I can only describe as brain damage. I can't handle any mental stress. By stress I mean anytime I have to concentrate, like right now my feet are twitching, ears are ringing and I am heavily agitated because I have to focus while writing this. 

I have no respite, I can't exercise because of Chronic Fatigue, I can't take medication to ease the mental side effects, and I am deathly scared of seeing a mental health professional. The power they have frightens me and I don't trust them enough not to send me to the psych ward. I'm too scared that if I say something that alarms them (I'm not suicidal) they will have me admitted. If I get admitted I will be given medication. There's a chance that the medication will cause Akathisia and I will die. That isn't a dramatisation. I will die.

I don't know what to do because all the traditional advice like exercise, diet, medication and meditation has no effect on me.

I feel, fake in a way, like I’m just being an attention seeker. Like I want to have a mental illness but I don’t. I will think “hey wouldn’t it be great if I had a panic attack right now?” And shit like that. I can’t talk about this to my friends because I am the one with no problems, a good family, happy life etc... I listen to their problems all the time and get involved in their drama. I feel like a walking talking therapist who can make funny jokes about having depression and talk a bit about how I am sad sometimes, then it goes back to them and all. I feel like trash because I know they need it and I am honestly good. They are the ones who have tried to commit suicide and have parents that don’t love them. The ones who rave run away from home and had exes cheat on them. I just feel like an attention whore for even thinking about bothering them with my minor problems. Going back, I remember the first time I cut, I was so proud to show my friend who introduced it to me because I was like her! Even now when my friends cut they show me and our friend group and their other friends. It gets the worst at night, I feel like there are a million voices inside me all saying different things, one voice will say to not go to school tomorrow and take a mental health break like my other friend did! Another voice says that is stupid, you aren’t even depressed, just go to bed, don’t make your friends worry about you, they already have enough on their plates. I have tried to talk to my mom about it before and it was okay for a little bit when talking about how I was kind of tired of my friends drama. Then when I tried to voice my opinion about this and that I didn’t know if I was depress or not she got concerned and was saying “but your not depressed right? You don’t ever seem depressed, you are a very happy kid” and I just agreed and she brushed it off. Even typing this out is making me have second thoughts. I really don’t need to waste all of your guys time. I don’t know anymore, sometimes I will feel like my happiness is just a mask I put on, other times I feel happy and it’s all good. I.

Here is the story:

\- I had missed arrived late for some appointments since I had to travel back from work. she didn't mind at the time. i apologised for it, and she said it was OK. I even had less time for the session, but it was my fault so I didn't mind it.

\- I had arranged another session, and then I genuinely forgot as I had other things planned around it.

\- she texted me to say that ""You had failed to attend your session"".

\- I apologised for this and then contacted her for another appointment and since then she's ignored me.

233,mentalhealth,1,"I don't know what to do I have a history of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, the works. I've been in therapy and on medication for just over 3 years now and I just don't have anything left that I can make myself do. My therapist gives me advice, and sometimes I follow it with bad outcomes, sometimes I can't bring myself to.  
I just went through (almost a year ago, hah) a bad breakup and it's resulted pretty much in me losing all of my trust and all of my happiness. I was doing good before it happened. I was doing really well. I hadn't self-harmed in, geez, like 5 years. Now I'm back at it. I was really happy with who I was, and now I can't stand myself. Nothing changed. Just I had a relationship, and then it was gone. And I haven't been the same since. And it makes me feel like the stupidest person alive. It's not that I think I'll never date again or something; I understand what's happened to me. I understand everything so well. But that doesn't really make a difference.  
I just feel like there's nothing left to do. I can't seem to make friends, and I'm not sure why. I've done the whole 'keep your feelings in and explode' thing. I've done the whole 'talk too much about your problems and everyone thinks you're crazy' thing. I'm a good student; it's not like I can't get out of bed in the morning. I have to. But, it's all I can do. I can't stand the way I feel and no advice my therapist throws at me helps me at all. I just kind of feel like a lost cause. I don't know what to do. I can't kill myself because I'm afraid of dying. I can't drop out of school and burrow away. I can't get myself to take practical steps to get better. I don't have any moves left. No moves but trudge along my miserable way through school, using really bad coping mechanisms to make myself feel a fraction of a bit better. I just don't see things ever improving. Not in a way that matters.  
I kind of just want to quit therapy and pretend like there's nothing wrong with me like I did before, but I suppose I was miserable then too. I just wish I wasn't miserable. I wish I had the motivation to do anything important. Anything at all.  
I don't even know why I'm making this post but I guess I'm just going on a limb. I'm just trying to grasp for anything I can find, 'cause I just don't know what to do anymore. Hah, I wish someone had a magic wand or a genie or something and just wish me out of this. I don't really see myself improving any other way. Maybe I won't get anything out of this post.

She was poly and explained it to me. I was hesitant and even scared, but I let her introduce me to this new and exciting world. We grew very, very close. We teased each other about getting married one day. Eventually I asked her if the teasing was just teasing or if she really did want to get married. She said she wanted to, and I smiled the biggest smile ever. I got to talk to her kids and we were making plans to meet. 
After two years, something happened. She asked if she could introduce someone new to our relationship. Again, I was hesitant but I said yes. I asked if there could be rules in place, such as no webcam sex until I had gotten used to it. She began to claim I wasn’t understanding polyamory and that I was being manipulative. She said she needed a break but we could still rp. 
That lasted one week. On a Monday, I got a long message saying how she felt I was abusive and manipulative, and she ghosted me. Gone forever.

239,mentalhealth,1,"Am i going crazy or am going to die? I am a 17M. 

So this all started with this incident nearly 2 months ago, where food was stuck in my throat and i thought i night choke any second. I kept on panicking and panicking and panicking. I then developed globus sensation after 1 whole week of constant extreme worrying and stressing out. I wouldn't eat for a whole week and not exercise at all.

I would smoke weed even tho i knew i had a bad throat problem and had depersonalization and when i would get high it got worse and i got some bad depersonalization after. (I have had depersonalization before all this but it was weak and its stronger then ever as i type)

I then got over the throat problem but then developed heart palpitations. I cut out sugar and some time went by and it stopped. 

I then now got stomach cramps and gas probably related to the throat problem but i don't have acid reflux. It still probably affects my stomach somehow (my globus sensation)

Going thru all this one right after the other to the end has really freaking messed me up. I feel way more stronger depersonalization all the time, i can't eat during the evenings and nights because my throat feels worse and i cannot eat comfortably, feel stomach problems once every few days, am experiencing masturbation withdrawals symptoms, reduced sugar intake... i feel like am really going crazy especially at night times.

For a long time this was writing and a lot of exercise/ diet. My old therapist always recommended meditation as well, but it was never something I could stick to.

If I went back, i'd imagine i'd be forking over quite a bit of money to be told similar things my old therapist told me. The only thing I think it would be worth going for is to get on some anti depressant drugs. I don't want to get on drugs.

**Have a more positive outlook on things**

&amp;#x200B;

* Rather than assuming things think about it realistically
* Go into things positively, rather than assuming its going to be bad

**Remove any toxicity from your life**

&amp;#x200B;

* Any toxic relationships: GET RID OF THEM
* Stay clear of people who have a negative influence on your life (people who do the wrong things, whether it’s behaviour or actions etc.)

Removing any toxicity from your life will clear your mind up of having to always please people or do things for them. Cut them out of your life, do things for yourself and protect your physical and mental health.

**Money wise**

&amp;#x200B;

* Make sure to be paid by people by said times

**Life wise**

&amp;#x200B;

* Make plans of things that need to be done (appointments, organising room etc.)
* Keep a weekly diary with picture (free prints each month)—&gt; to then possibly create a scrapbook of the year
* Manage your times, if you have to be somewhere by a certain time plan when you’re going to get ready/leave etc. and remember its better to be early than late, so plan to get to your location 10 minutes before
* Declutter cupboards, only keep things you actually need
* Buy gifts at least a month before someones birthday/christmas
* Priories people (family first)
* Priories things (tidy room is more of a priority than playing games on your phone)

**Relationships and social life**

**Build up relationships with people you interact with on a daily basis**

&amp;#x200B;

* If you work with people, say good morning, smile at them, make that little effort with them
* People you live with, help them with any chores etc.
* People you love, show them more affection

Making that little gesture can offer an olive branch and build up stronger relationships in the long run

**Social media**

&amp;#x200B;

* Take time away from social media and spend time with people in person
* Unfollow those celebrities/models that are setting unrealistic standards 
* Buy gifts at least a month before someones birthday/Christmas be badshower regularly, change bed sheets regularly))to see things you’re posting",plan new plan new year new decade new chapter life year year improve main goal shape short term healthier drink water carbs fruit veg join gym friendlier people make new friend spend time parent weekly journal hand assignment time spend time self care digital detox positive outlook thing frivolous money long term loose weight advance boxing stop biting nail abroad treat family gift talk people trust certain people productive create note plan aim distinction end june improve concentration don t annoyed easily take average day create new habit month stick slowly easier carry doing thing resist biting nail drink water thirsty smile happy way loose weight food drink cut sugar low sugar cut starch reduce appetite eat meal drink ml water day stick water day low sugar squash juice dirty snacking meal fruit veg bar low sugar fizzy drink week sugar fizzy weekend grilled salad water fruit work exercise run x week tuesday thursday squat sit ups press ups day boxing x week football x week selfcare skincare create routine skin wash moisture try wear makeup clear skin make healthier boost self esteem long run maintain good daily selfceare routine brush hair brush teeth shower reguarly change bed sheet regularly weigh everyday food weight diary possible way better person make small everyday change make bed morning clothes away wash basket end everyday create list need day make note thing happened day week positive outlook thing wake think got smile assuming thing think realistically thing positively assuming going bad remove toxicity life toxic relationship rid stay clear people negative influence life people wrong thing s behaviour action removing toxicity life clear mind having people thing cut life thing protect physical management money wise stop frivolous money growing tree don t feel pressured just remember bill pay buy thing absolute necessity week plan need brought present make sure paid people said time life wise make plan thing need appointment organising room weekly diary picture free print month possibly create scrapbook year manage time certain time plan going ready leave remember better early late plan location minute declutter cupboard thing actually need buy gift month someone birthday christmas priory people family priory thing tidy room priority playing game phone relationship social life build relationship people interact daily basis work people say good morning smile make little effort people live help chore people love affection making little gesture offer olive branch build stronger relationship long run social medium time away social medium spend time people person unfollow celebrity model setting unrealistic standard buy gift month someone birthday christmas badshower regularly change bed sheet regularly thing posting

It started off as I would only eat one apple every day, or, just nothing at all. I never stopped myself unless I was really truly hungry. Basically, I got over it. Didn't deal with any of those issues ages 13 and 14. Recently, within the past year, I have felt it come back more and more. My parent happened to notice I had reminders set for me not to eat on my phone. You know what they did? Try to help? No. At least worry? Nope. They got angry. Then proceeded to tell all their friends without my consent, make fun of me, and accuse me of attention seeking.  It was never about the attention though, so that's what I don't understand. This is a battle within MYSELF. I am so afraid to talk about any of it, and also afraid to tell my doctor. How do I help myself for the next 2 years of my stay in hell?

254,mentalhealth,1,"Can PTSD show up years later? I am 18M and when I was 11-12 I was molested by a boy 3-4 years older than me. I don’t remember the exact age I was for some reason. Same with my dad. He used to hit me, but I can’t remember when it started it when it ended. I remember him becoming my friend and gaining my trust, then one time we were in the lake and we were play fighting and he wrapped his legs around mine and closed them shut so I couldn’t escape and he started touching and grabbing me through my thin soccer shorts that I was wearing as swim shorts at the time. For years I blocked it out and dismissed it as “almost molested,” because he only grabbed my penis once and he didn’t perform any sex acts on me. But lately the memories have come back up and it’s really bothering me. I have had panic attacks after having flashbacks and triggering thoughts. One time my body went numb and I couldn’t control my muscles. I tried to take a drink of water and I just dropped it. If I see anything about child sexual abuse I have to look away and I start hyperventilating. I can’t sleep at night. I have been up past 6 am for over 2 weeks now. I just sit in my phone because I can’t stand being without a distraction. Sometimes I can even feel his legs or his hands again. I can see his smile in my mind when I close my eyes. I feel overwhelming anxiety, embarrassment and shame. All I want to do is sit inside and get away from people. They can’t be trusted. Unless they understand what it’s like, they don’t care. They just tell you to go see a therapist. Like they just pawn you off to be someone else’s problem. They must just not understand how to help and it makes them uncomfortable, but it’s still extremely disheartening. The only support I have really got the has been online. My friends seem to just want to ignore it. It just feels hopeless. What some people do to others, especially children, for their own sick pleasure. Gain a child’s trust just to throw it in their face, and traumatize them for a few seconds of pleasure. I have become extremely introverted since it happened. I avoid intimate and sexual relationships because they are too stressful to even think about. I’ve never had a girlfriend, let alone had sex. I’ve had people tell me that it I might have PTSD, even in other posts I have made on this sub, and I think they are right, but I didn’t really have many of these problems, except for the introversion and avoidance of relationships, before the memories came back in early December. I read that PTSD symptoms start soon after the trauma, but it’s been 6-7 years. Is this something else? Can PTSD appear years after the traumatic event?

My SO thinks inpatient would be good for me. He’s worried about me. He told me he’s scared to leave me alone and feels like he has to ‘babysit’ me or I’ll hurt myself or commit suicide.

257,mentalhealth,1,"Can someone help me understand what my options are for short-term suicidal ideation rehab in New York City? I love my job. It's maybe the only thing that gives me a consistent feeling of self-worth, and I'm surrounded by fun and supportive coworkers. It has been keeping me going and I'm extremely grateful. So I don't want to risk losing it or the support of my coworkers, even if the law might protect me to enter a rehab program.

If I felt I really needed to, to turn my life around, **I wondered what my options for short-term inpatient or outpatient (2-6 weeks) treatment for suicidal ideation in New York City, and what I might expect from the program.** It sounds ignorant and I admit I am—I admit I'm driven by a momentary spark of self-care.

That's all, but here is more if someone would be willing to read.

\---

It's been fifteen years since I remember wanting to take my life. I'm 30-something now. I made it this far because of good times with girlfriends and chasing dreams, because of novelties like doing drugs with friends or moving to a new city, and also because of therapy at times and medicine at times. Life always had something new to distract me. But there was never a stretch longer than week I think, that I didn't think about dying. I could never be truly honest with my doctors, and the one time I tried, I was almost committed against my will and about to lose my job and everything—I had to cry and beg to get out of it with a promise that I'd see another doctor the next day.

I always looked for some feeling that felt different one day in my life, anything to latch onto. And right now I feel something like that. I want to try again to find a therapist, despite the exhausting and disappointing process. I want to commit to seeing a psychiatrist regularly and open my mind to any medicine they want to suggest—in a way, I'm ready to submit to them. I want to drink less. All this, not because I care about me, but because I'm sick and tired of making my family and friends and coworkers feel the way I make them feel. Never seeming well, always worried or stressed or tired, everyone having to tiptoe, and closer ones walking on glass. Never being able to commit because I won't know how I'll feel, even the next day. Not replying to texts for days or weeks, and completely having given up on phone calls and emails. Never wanting anything even when they want do so much for me, because ultimately I don't give a damn about myself. Annually cutting communication with everyone and hearing later that they each wondered what they did wrong, when in fact it was my inability to cope with the burden and harm I felt I was to them.

If I *want* to die but still don't have the *will* to die, then *until* I gain the will to die, I want to get better, for all these people I've hurt and I'm going to hurt, wallowing and existing doing no service to anyone. I don't have the capacity to care about myself, but I have some capacity to care for others.

So I thought, aside from just trying all those things—therapists, doctors, medicine, less drinking—and possibly failing and falling back to square one, what can I do this time to really drive it in, really feel like this time it's a real attempt to get better? And I thought, maybe I can prove it to myself by committing to a rehab program, even if it means unpaid leave from my job, and taking it from there.

Maybe none of this is a good idea, I don't know now. It was a momentary feeling driving me, but the moment feels important to me.",help understand option short term suicidal ideation rehab new york city love job s maybe thing give consistent feeling self worth m surrounded fun supportive coworkers keeping going m extremely grateful don t want risk losing support coworkers law protect enter rehab program felt really needed turn life wondered option short term inpatient outpatient week treatment suicidal ideation new york city expect program sound ignorant admit admit m driven momentary spark self care s willing read \ s year remember wanting life m far good time girlfriend chasing dream novelty like doing drug friend moving new city therapy time medicine time life new distract stretch longer week think didn t think dying truly honest doctor time tried committed lose job beg promise d doctor day looked feeling felt different day life latch right feel like want try therapist despite exhausting disappointing process want commit seeing psychiatrist regularly open mind medicine want suggest way m ready submit want drink care m sick tired making family friend coworkers feel way make feel worried stressed tired having tiptoe closer one walking glass able commit won t know ll feel day replying text day week completely having given phone call email wanting want ultimately don t damn annually cutting communication hearing later wondered did wrong fact inability cope burden harm felt want die don t die gain die want better people hurt m going hurt wallowing existing doing service don t capacity care capacity care thought aside just trying thing therapist doctor medicine drinking possibly failing falling square time really drive really feel like time s real attempt better thought maybe prove committing rehab program mean unpaid leave job taking maybe good idea don t know momentary feeling driving moment feel important

Everyday I get off I cry in my car before I leave the parking lot. When I’m off for a few days in a row I spend majority of the first day in bed, in this weird heavy depressive state. I fight off breakdowns and just walking out when I’m there. I apply to new jobs everyday with no luck. At this point I’m scared of the direction that my mental health is going in because of this job.

259,mentalhealth,1,"I have no idea what's wrong with me or who I even am Hi, so basically I just need to rant about this because I feel like I'm completely losing my mind and I have no idea what is wrong with me and nobody seems to understand what I mean, I barely understand what I mean. Basically, I'm 17, I've been on Prozac (40 mg) for about 6 months? I think? I don't even remember when I started. I go to therapy bi-weekly. I feel completely empty and lost. My mental health seems like something that nobody can crack, not even me. I feel invalid and stupid whenever I complain about my mental wellbeing, and I don't know if it's because of metacognition or whatever, I just feel like that I'm self-aware of what's wrong with me it makes me fake. My trauma feels fake, my whole life feels fake and most times I can't remember being so viscerally angry or upset, I kept a trauma journal since my 17th birthday to make sure I remember when I have breakdowns and stuff, for a while I felt like someone was erasing my memory while I was asleep or that my medication erases my memory, and I still believe that now. I just don't feel like I fit into the mental illness box, my boyfriend says I'm not mentally ill and that bad stuff just happened to me, so that makes me feel fake and stupid, but I know he has the best intentions. My therapist just passes it off as anxiety and depression, which I know are serious things but it doesn't feel like anyone in my life takes me seriously. I can't open up about certain things without feeling they're downplayed, or that my traumas weren't severe enough, or that I'm making stuff up. 

Basically, I grew up in a super shitty home, (my therapist confirmed this), the school I go to and my therapist have almost called CPS numerous times. When I was very young (around 3-4) I was diagnosed with PAN and spent 6 months in intensive care. I had most of my intestines removed. I don't remember much about the hospital but my parents say that I was very angry, and I would bite and scream all the time. I don't remember anything about it really. From ages 8-12 I believed I was an angel and that my parents couldn't be my ""real"" parents because my ""real"" parents would never hurt me. I truly believed that the day I turned 12 I would be brought to live in the clouds with my true angel mother who would never hurt me, and that I was on earth to suffer for a little while before I was able to be happy. Of course, that never happened and my delusion completely fell apart as soon as I woke up in the same bed.  When I was 13 I had vivid hallucinations of a ""Ring"" style girl with long black hair ripping out her intestines at the end of my bed. I had flashing images of fucked up faces that were in front of my eyes. I know I wasn't dreaming. I also hallucinated a boy who opened his mouth full of teeth and he ate me. I didn't sleep that night and cried on the floor. I had hallucinations outside the next day of a giant furry creature with huge teeth. There were other things. Those hallucinations only lasted 3 days before I think things went back to normal and I no longer had visual hallucinations or auditory ones. At least none that I can remember. I also have extreme apathy about my family, I feel no love towards them whatsoever. When I was 12 I prayed every day that my parents would die in a car crash. I always fantasized about a ""Sucker Punch"" style revenge where I would kill them all and get to be free. I hoped a lot that my family would die and I could escape. I've never acted on those thoughts of course, but they've been extremely present and intrusive throughout my whole life. My freshmen year of high school I was sexually assaulted, the school did nothing, they knew about it, the kid wasn't even punished. It wasn't that bad, just unwanted groping so I didn't even have it bad. I have vivid nightmares about being raped almost every week, often 2 or 3 nights in a row. They're extremely lucid, not that I can do anything but that I can feel everything happening. They're often violent and I am scared to go to sleep sometimes. I believed I was being raped while I slept by my father or a demon but I can acknowledge that that's a ridiculous thing to believe. I've had a few suicide attempts but I've never been hospitalized. 

That's about all I can remember. That's all my mental stuff thrown out there. I don't know. Most times I feel extremely fake. I feel like I am empty and blank all the time. I feel like I don't know who I am, that I can't even rely on myself to judge my self-concept. Sometimes I feel like just anxiety and depression doesn't explain it all, and that nobody is taking me seriously. I don't know what to tell my therapist, because whenever I go into his office I am suddenly fine and in a good mood. I write stuff down in my trauma journal or in my phone but I can't work up the courage to talk about it. I don't know what to do. I feel like I am about to snap. The best way I can put it is that my foundation is infested in termites, and there are so many holes and pieces rotting and being eaten away, but everyone has just put a gloss over it and pretends like that's enough even though the termites still chew away at it. I feel like I'm on a stack of cards built on top of that gloss, and at any second the foundation will fall away. I feel like a blanket is being pulled over my head and I'm suffocating. I just don't know what to do. I should be grateful that I'm on medication and have therapy but I just don't feel like my needs are being met. I know that's selfish to say but some things don't add up. Recently I've missed a lot of days for my meds, but on those days at least I feel like myself again, I feel like a person instead of a husk. I just don't know what's wrong with me, if I'm being ungrateful and unreasonable or if something really is wrong.

261,mentalhealth,1,"I have some sort of eating disorder issue, and it’s consuming my life. I don’t know where do go from here. Any advice? I’ve been struggling with a lot of body image issues for about 10 months now. It’s been about 9 months since I began to obsess over my calorie intake, exercise, and purging. I began dating my girlfriend around the time this started, though she has absolutely nothing to do with it. I ended up breaking up with her and cutting ties with the majority of my friends when school came back around this year because I snapped. My anxiety and depression had suddenly worsened and my eating habits became worse. I lost a significant amount of weight in the span of about a month, causing my family to notice. I lost my period, I would barely eat, and I went down quite a few clothing sizes. My self hatred, shame, and embarrassment caused me to attempt to take my own life multiple times. I was admitted into a treatment program for anxiety and depression, where I did not even mention a word about my possible eating disorder issues. Looking back, I realize how stupid that was of me. But a large part of me did not want to “recover”, and I often still feel the same way. Even though this thing consumes my life completely and is on my mind 24/7, I still can’t bring myself to genuinely believe that there is anything wrong. I recently got back together with my girlfriend, and I told her about my struggles primarily over the summer. I told her I am ok now, though not much has changed. I am lying to her about something that drove me to break up with her in the first place, and something that she deserves to know about. I cant stop myself from purging. I just purged tonight. I just can’t and sometimes I want it all to stop so badly. Food is always on my mind and no matter what I do I can’t change it. Recovery is very intimidating and I don’t feel I qualify for it or deserve it. But I love my girlfriend so much and I don’t want to lose her. I am losing myself again and I’m always tired.

He has learned how to distract himself, but has never had any formal therapy. Lately, he has been struggling with his mental health and doesn’t know what to do about it. 

He currently has no heath insurance, so seeking therapy in the traditional route is unfortunately not an option. We have been struggling with money, and I think this adds to the anxiety. We moved away from home last year and are just now getting on our feet financially. He hates his bartending job, but doesn’t know what he wants to do, and doesn’t have a car or the means to find other work. 

The next step is getting a car on the road for him, and then finding a better job with benefits so he can start going to therapy. But in the meantime, what are things that he can do to help with the feelings of anxiety and depression? I suggested regular exercise, either running, biking, ju jitsu, etc. and making little, manageable improvements in his daily life.

273,mentalhealth,1,"Going public with my mental health I’ve been on a mental health journey the last 4 or 5 years mainly dealing with anxiety, but I believe it has been present in me long before I was aware of it.  A lot of it stems from a highly legalistic Christian background that made me just dwell in fear most of my life.  While I still consider myself a Christian, I am way more open minded and welcoming to others and feel like my view of God is night and day different than when I was younger. 

Over the last year or so I’ve been going to counseling and got back on medication for anxiety, and over the last half a year I’ve been writing articles on my Medium account talking about a lot of these life/mindset changes I’ve been going through.  Last week, I reached a point where I actually opened up fully and publicly about my anxiety and what I’ve been doing to work through it.  A year ago I couldn’t have imagined doing that.

If you feel like you’re in a place where anxiety has you locked up, it doesn’t have to stay that way forever.  You can get out of it.  If you need someone to give you permission to get help for yourself, let’s talk.

274,mentalhealth,1,"Are you a survivor of mental illness? [REPORTSURVIVAL] Hey yall,

\#ReportSurvival is an initiative to share real life survivor stories, give the hopeless hope, and help end suicide contagion. Right now we're looking for people who have stories that they'd be willing to share. If you or someone you know does, we'd love to hear from ya! Also, if you have feedback on the proposal below we welcome your comments.

All the best,

The #ReportSurvival team

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE?**

***The news is killing people.***

When we lost Robin Williams the suicide rate increased by 10%. Marilyn Monroe: 12%. When Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain committed suicide, the hotline got 25% more calls. It's called *suicide contagion,* and it’s the proven link between mass media coverage of suicide and an increase in suicide rates.

Think about it. If a celebrity with more resources and success couldn’t beat it, how can anyone? It makes you feel hopeless. And hopelessness can be deadly.

With suicide rates increasing across the world, we have to do something now more than ever. Something unprecedented. We have to tell the other side of the story. Where people survive and thrive. We have to #ReportSurvival.

***#ReportSurvival***\*\*?\*\*

\#ReportSurvival is a campaign guiding news organizations to report suicide more responsibly. Whether it’s Buzzfeed, the local news, or CNN, we’ll create a media landscape where a story of someone who survived suicide follows every report of someone who didn't.

**WHY SURVIVOR STORIES?**

***Why survivor stories?***

For every person that dies by suicide, another 280 people survive. Many of whom go on to live happy, fulfilling lives. These stories of survival and perseverance hold extraordinary power. That's why they're an effective way to end suicide contagion. But don't take it from us, take it from them:

“Portraying suicide survivors rather than focusing on completed cases in the media is more effective in reducing suicide contagion.”

* *Madelyn Gould, professor of clinical epidemiology at Columbia University and expert in youth suicide*

“Our best answers as to why suicides happen and what we can do to prevent them are not found by focusing on the one person who died by suicide, but by focusing on the living—the other 280 who survived.”

* *John Draper, Ph.D., executive director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline*

“It turns out that, although suicide can be contagious, resilience can also be contagious. And when we look at media reports that talk about people who thought about suicide but instead got help and got better, that actually rates across the population, the number of deaths that happen in a specific area, go down. And we really really want to encourage people to report in that kind of way.”

* *Mark Sinyor, M.D., Clinical Researcher and Professor at the University of Toronto*

“Hearing stories from people who have survived suicide attempts is an important step in suicide prevention.”

* *Professor Patrick McGorry, former Australian of the Year for his services to youth mental health*

“Their stories are not only enlightening professionals who create policies or study the subject, but they are also transmitting all important hope to those at risk.""

* *Center for Suicide Prevention*

""People see stories all the time about those surviving breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke, and we know what that recovery looks like—it helps people who are experiencing it or someone whose mom just got diagnosed. So many people go through their suicidal crisis feeling completely isolated and alone because they think they're the only ones. But they're not. There are millions of healing and recovery stories—they just haven't been shared.""

* *Shelby Rowe, a youth suicide prevention program manager for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services*

***Don’t survivor stories already exist?***

When was the last time you saw an uplifting news story about someone who overcame suicide? Unfortunately, it’s human nature to take an interest in conflict, drama, and tragedy. As a result, the few survivor stories that are independently produced are unpromoted and low quality.

Of the content that does exist, ours will be different in several crucial ways:

1. ***Relevance*** \- Instead of one or two, we’ll feature 20 unique stories. This ensures every sufferer, no matter their experience, has something they can relate to.
2. ***Quality*** \- We’ve worked with award-winning production companies, many of whom are interested in pro-bono work. That means we’ll have the best equipment, crews, and directors to deliver quality films that distinguish our stories and engage our viewers.
3. ***Compelling Content*** \- We’ve learned storytelling at some of the world’s most renown advertising agencies and news organizations. Given our experience, we’re confident we can create films that are enthralling, concise, and effective.
4. ***Understanding*** *–* We understand these issues because we’ve been victims of them. Whether it’s suicide, suicide contagion, or depression, the videos we’re creating are films we wish existed when we felt lost and hopeless.
5. ***Casting*** \- Finding the right people is essential. Without a good story, we don’t have a film worth making. That’s why we won’t proceed until we’re completely satisfied.
6. ***Link to Treatment*** \- This is about more than hope. It’s about action and lasting change. That’s why we’re putting emphasis on how suicide survivors got through it, giving concrete examples of how others can too. Each film will link to treatment options and affordable resources to help people take the next step and get the help they so desperately need.

**HOW WILL THIS WORK?**

For this to work, we need news organizations to see these survivor stories and make a commitment to #ReportSurvival. Here’s why it will happen:

1. ***It’s nothing new:*** Media guidelines for how to report suicide already exist. The most effective being the suicide prevention hotline. Problem is, suicide contagion is only getting worse. This makes #ReportSurvival a simple, yet essential evolution of these guidelines.
2. ***We made it simple:*** We'll make the survivor films ourselves. All they’ll have to do is link to the film. That's one line of text alongside the suicide prevention hotline number. It’s that easy.
3. ***Broadcast quality:*** Our films will be as compelling and well produced as any broadcast segment.
4. ***Variety:*** With 20 different films, news outlets won’t have to worry about covering the same story.
5. ***Pre-launch partnership:*** We’ll partner with a news organization beforehand. When we launch they'll pledge to #ReportSurvival, which ensures others will follow.
6. ***PR:*** A well-executed PR plan is essential. In the absence of one, our survivor stories will get lost in a clutter of internet content. Our experience pitching blogs and acquiring earned media will ensure people and news organizations won’t miss our efforts.
7. ***Legitimacy:*** Along the way, we'll get endorsements from mental health organizations like NAMI and influencers like Michael Phelps.
8. ***They already care:*** Unlike the rest of the world, reporters are well aware of suicide contagion. #ReportSurvival is a chance for them to help end a life or death issue they’re painfully aware of.

With that, let’s go over how this works executionally.

1. ***Pre-Launch: The Stories***

***Casting***

First things first. We’ll partner with a casting agency to help us find the most moving survivor stories. At the same time, we’ll tap into our own networks to cast an even wider net.

***Production***

To ensure viewers have a story they can relate to, we'll produce 20 films. Each will represent a different gender, sexuality, race, age, trauma, or treatment. That means 300 million people who’re suffering from depression will finally have access to stories they can relate to.

***Partnerships***

The more help we can get the better. Whether it’s non-profits with funding, individuals with feedback, or production partners with time and equipment, we’ll take whatever we can get.

2) ***Pre-Launch: #ReportSurvival***

***Influencers***

Although it’s not essential, influencers have helped spark some of the most successful social movements in the digital age. Movements like #MeToo, Obama’s “Change” campaign, and the Ice Bucket Challenge dominated the internet because of influencer support.

Given this issue's importance, our connections, and how unaware people are, we believe we can recruit some of the world’s most influential people. Celebrities with their own survivor stories in all areas of life. Oprah, Michael Phelps, Ted Turner, Prince Harry, and J.K. Rowling are just a few examples of influencers who are just as passionate as we are.

***Bring on the News***

As proven with the existing suicide guidelines when one news organization commits to change, the rest join. Doesn’t matter if it’s Fox News or MSNBC, they all want to help end suicide contagion. So as we previously mentioned, we’ll partner with an organization beforehand.

3) ***Launch***

***Wait for it***

Every high profile suicide has lead to record-breaking global awareness, but very little action or change. By launching our campaign in reaction to the next widely publicized high profile suicide, we’ll turn awareness into action.

**WHO ARE WE?**

***I’m Tim***

I spent the last 6 years working at Ogilvy &amp; Mather. While there, I executed campaigns for American Express, British Airways, Coke Zero, ThinkPad, and Qualcomm.

I know what it's like to feel hopeless. I know suicide contagion exists because I was almost a victim of it. And I know how discouraging it is to see countless stories of people who gave up, but none of the people who beat it.

That’s why this isn’t something I *want* to do. This is something I *will do*.

***The Agency***

My digital media company GUSH specializes in social media campaigns and PR-worthy executions. Part of our business is applying our digital, social, and PR skills to end the mental health crisis.

I don't have sexual nor romantic feelings towards her, I'm a gay guy, so I don't understand why I block so much when she approaches me. I kinda feel like she's gonna make fun of me every time she speaks to me because she once did by imitating my nervous gestures, but is that all? I move past my shit quicker than this usually. And when she's fooling around, I don't think she really means to seriously offend anyone, she's naturally bubbly and I feel like this is her way of joking with someone. She doesn't seem like a bad person. But I always withdraw whenever she approaches me, joking or not. Keep in mind that she also had an outburst at me that same day when she made fun of my gestures when we supposedly ""made up"" because she apologized to me and things were really tense that day. Am I traumatized then? But how could I be this easy to traumatize? Can anyone explain this to me because I've been struggling to explain this to myself for months now. I'm sorry if I'm bothering you with unimportant crap, but people really helped me out on this sub in the past, so I'd like to hear your deductions.

Edit: Also keep in mind that I'm still in the closet and ever since she started doing this stuff, I'm paranoid that she can see through me.

I'm 26 and married (for now at least). 

I've been dating my now wife for about 10 years now. About a year ago I became addicted to alcohol. A short time after that I started compulsively lying about everything, big or small. From getting promotions at work, to being in a car accident, to what time I would come home from work. 

I recently got discovered, and naturally my wife is furious. 

I'm going to my first AA meeting later tonight, and I'm starting therapy that specializes in sexual abuse later this week. 

The worst part is that I feel very little emotion or remorse. I don't know if I'm in shock or just apathetic and depressed. But it's really hard for me feel right now. And that makes me want to drink again and end my massive 12 hours of sobriety already.

-I used to be pretty creative as a kid and drew everyday. I think discovering the internet, this whole other world of overabundance in entertainment, really fcked me up. And I have no doubt discovering porn killed a lot of motivation I had for healthier activities.

-I have this habit of thinking ""Oh, I might try this and that out and turn it into a legit hobby and if I'm lucky enough, a career out of it"" I can't count the number of times I've started this only to quit within a few days. Basically things that aren't required, but challenge me, I end up quitting. And these are things my other friend does with no hesitation and things you would think I would be interested in(trailer editing, music production, writing film reviews, web designing for a blog where I could talk about my interests).

Now I've never been diagnosed with any of the above mental conditions and I think if I did, I'm not at a severe level. Since being a kid, I moved around a lot and never really fit into any group. I 've always been introverted and didn't like sports except when I did track in HS, which I actually kinda excelled at. I scored somewhat in neuroticism in the big 5 psychology test to no surprise, I've always been socially anxious and the feared talking with people and in front of the room. I feel like I've ruined dates on online dating by having doubts and not being able to keep my cool. I'm always scared of not being able to get along or impress someone and this is due to lack of inner confidence than looks, the lack of grounded confidence is what kills opportunities with other people. I have had a few bouts of depression here and there but I would say mostly triggered from life events. Although these bouts caused me to be more introspective and become sad about the things I was not achieving.

Should I seek therapy/medication? Or avoid that road and just meditate re-attempt certain activities and see where that takes me?

TLDR: Introverted guy, wants to achieve more, but laziness holds me back. Idk if that can be attributed to mental disorders, but I want to seek help or apply more self help to help me reach my potential.",add depression anxiety undiagnosed condition holding laziness m y o male m currently holding pretty stable job live away parent best physically active socially active friend good way want highlight habit mindset currently feel like prevent doing m huge nerd s wrong life spent consuming entertainment m making list movie comic anime music video game show consume majority free time go used pretty creative kid drew everyday think discovering internet world overabundance entertainment really fcked doubt discovering porn killed lot motivation healthier activity habit thinking oh try turn legit hobby m lucky career t count number time started quit day basically thing aren t required challenge end quitting thing friend doe hesitation thing think interested trailer editing music production writing film review web designing blog talk interest diagnosed condition think did m severe level kid moved lot really fit group introverted didn t like sport did track h actually kinda excelled scored somewhat neuroticism big psychology test surprise socially anxious feared talking people room feel like ruined date online dating having doubt able cool m scared able impress lack inner confidence look lack grounded confidence kill opportunity people bout depression say triggered life event bout caused introspective sad thing achieving seek therapy medication avoid road just meditate attempt certain activity take tldr introverted guy want achieve laziness hold idk attributed disorder want seek help apply self help help reach potential

I went from being her Superman to being Lex Luthor. The whole thing was emotionally draining and heartbreaking.

It was a really important relationship to me, and while we dealt with a lot, 95% of the relationship was actually amazing.

285,mentalhealth,1,"What can be done, if anything, if spouse refuses to see a professional, nor any desire to get better? After 25 years of marriage, and three (grown to almost grown) children, my high functioning wife has had a complete mental breakdown.

It relates to a career decision she made that backfired, and cost her some salary/prestige.  The amount of the salary cut she took, and the cost of being out of work for a while, is in an isolated number if I typed it out, sounds meaningful.  However, in the context of our overall current financial situation (savings, my income, her income potential, etc), it is at most, a slight inconvenience.  In the context of our overall life and plan, it is barely a blip.  We have spent at least half our marriage in a much more challenging financial situation.

However, she has absolutely collapsed mentally and emotionally in the past six months.  She is incapable of any conversation that isn't a variation of:

\-wanting to wake up from the nightmare/go back in time

\-She's ruined our lives

\-Everything is lost and is all over

She cannot and will not enjoy anything in life, including time with her children.  She will not participate in anything she previously did for household or for enjoyment. She's broken off her friend group.  She mainly just paces, and babbles the same things over and over.  She's basically becoming agoraphobic and can't interact with anyone...the trajectory is that she will not be attending our childrens' graduations, weddings, etc.

She, and our children have been begging her to see someone for months, and she's a hard refusal.  Her opinion is that it's too late, and a therapist can't do anything because they don't have a time machine.  The damage has been done, and there's nothing they can do or say to help, it's all over and we're ruined, and our children's futures are ruined.  She refuses to even look at financial numbers, budgets, etc that show otherwise, she's set her mind that we're going bankrupt, going to lose the house, etc...anything I try to explain why we are fine financially is ""you don't know, you don't know, it's over.""

She does not want to get better, does not believe there is any future, any possibility of any hope for the future.  Here only context to discuss things being better is that we can go back in time and she not leave the job she had.  That's where it begins and ends, she will not consider anything moving forward.

I don't have any mental health experience, so I don't want to armchair diagnose...it seems like depression, obsessive thinking, anxiety, delusion...anything and everything.  It's basically the type of state I would expect someone to be in from losing a child, or more specifically, accidentally causing the death of a child.  She's that level of distraught, all the time, without relief, and it's been going on for months.

Is there anything that can be done when someone flat out refuses help or any effort to get better?  Or are our lives ruined, and this just something I live with and try to keep things together as long as I can before it all falls apart?  Everything I read online about supporting someone with mental illness presupposes that they want to get better, at least in some moments of clarity, but there isn't one second of the last six months, despite encouraging, begging, crying, screaming, threatening, etc where she has given an inch, even the slightest consideration, to wanting to get better or to see a therapist.

287,mentalhealth,1,"I think my boyfriend is mentally ill. But psych doesn't seem concerned. I've been with my boyfriend more than 5 years. He's always had a bit of a temper, but nothing extreme enough to worry about. In the past two years I've noticed some changes in his behaviour that really worry me. (He is in his late 20s - early 30s) He's been engaging in more and more generally reckless behavior, has started to become enraged over even the tiniest things, he has threatened me in fits of anger and I have felt unsafe, is over-exaggerating everything and saying things  then swearing 100% that he never said it, decreased empathy and an emergence of extreme selfishness, constant irritability, extremely low self-esteem, he's paranoid that everyone hates him all the time, constantly unsure of what he wants/likes, says he feels empty all the time, talks about how nobody would miss him if he died and says he'll just jump in front of a bus/train etc but swears he's just joking when I ask him about it later, gets upset/clingy/needy when I'm away from him and also has panic attacks, cannot sleep unless I'm next to him.  + more. Worringly he doesn't think there's a problem and that hes fine and will often deny he has any of these symptoms.

These things have been severely affecting my own not so great mental health. I'm very concerned.

I convinced him to see a psychologist and he's been seeing him for a month now, but the psychologist has cut back his sessions from fortnightly to monthly as the psychologist thinks his symptoms are not very concerning. (despite being told of the violent outbursts and threats) The psychologist has not diagnosed him with anything, nor has he had any kind of treatment except just talking.

Should I be telling him to get a different psychologist? What is the best course of action? Is the psychologist right and it's not that concerning? What are the likely diagnoses for his symptoms if he does have a mental illness?

288,mentalhealth,1,"I need help.. Hello, just to get this out of the way, I'm a 24-year-old guy.  I still live at home with my parents.  

There are alot of sentences that start with ""I"" so be warned haha.  

These last 4 months, I have been on a downward spiral.  I'm taking antidepressants but they don't do anything.  So I've resulted to addictions to energy drinks and fast food.  I don't go a day without fast food.  I'm starting to drink 2 energy drinks per day.  I woke up this morning and after 2 hours of being awake, I laid on my bed and was out for another 40 minutes.  I went to bed at a decent time last night too. This has become more and more common.  

I don't have any real friends.  I do get along with people at work just fine and I sorta talk to people at my church but not really.  As a result, I spend a ton of time by myself and it's starting to eat on me.  I feel my skills of making and keeping conversations are rapidly fading.  On top of this, I gradually find it more and more difficult to even start a conversation with someone.  

Recently I decided to get a Nintendo switch.  I bought it for a few reasons, but here are 2 big ones.  

Reason No. 1. 

I don't have any hobbies or interests.  So I thought that a switch would be good for me.  Sadly, I find that I have to force myself to play video games.  I do enjoy them, but not as much as I want to....this really saddens me.  

Reason No. 2

I really want to fit in.  I want to be able to be apart of conversations about video games and all that stuff.  It's broader in my mind, but this is the best I can put it.  

So yeah, there are my reasons.  I'm not sure if talking about this was all that important, but I thought it was a little, so I included it.  

Every so often, I get these hours where I am very happy and energetic.  It seems to come out of nowhere.  I notice that I get more talkative around my family and I feel pretty happy.  But those hours aren't many.  I'd say for every 96 hours, maybe 15 of them (not in a row but spread across the 96 hour period) I feel those ""happy"" hours.   The rest of the time I'm quiet, anti-social, and tired.  

Now you might say that I need to exercise.  And you are right, I do need it.  But I have lost the desire to do so.  Since 2017, I've gained 40 pounds.  I promised myself that I wouldn't go over 200, but that promise went out the window long ago.  I just don't care anymore.  

I feel stuck.  I'm like a car stuck in the mud and won't come out.  

😔",need help hello just way m year old guy live home parent alot sentence start warned haha month downward spiral m taking antidepressant don t resulted addiction energy drink fast food don t day fast food m starting drink energy drink day woke morning hour awake laid bed minute went bed decent time night common don t real friend people work just fine sorta talk people church really result spend ton time s starting eat feel skill making keeping conversation rapidly fading gradually difficult start conversation recently decided nintendo switch bought reason big one reason don t hobby interest thought switch good sadly force play video game enjoy want really saddens reason really want fit want able apart conversation video game stuff s broader mind best yeah reason m sure talking important thought little included hour happy energetic come notice talkative family feel pretty happy hour aren t d say hour maybe row spread hour period feel happy hour rest time m quiet anti social tired say need exercise right need lost desire gained pound promised wouldn t promise went window long ago just don t care anymore feel stuck m like car stuck mud won t come
289,mentalhealth,1,"I'm just venting I've always felt a bit off. I didn't have a so called ""bad"" childhood. I didn't really get bullied either since I am a pretty self critical person. Never have I felt that there's something wrong with myself. I don't really see the bad things in myself as bad things. 

I always had these periods when I'm really depressed about things. Not as in I feel bad about myself or really anything. More like just being bored of reality and existence. It's a kinda melancholic feeling. This last year it got worse, maybe because I've had so much stress about things that are not really relevant. I feel like I exist but not really, like I'm not myself. I feel like Plankton controlling SpongeBob but i am Plankton and SpongeBob.

I don't feel like the world has flaws. I'm not depressed about the situation of the world. I don't stress about my bad habits, my looks or anything like that. In fact I'm really happy with myself as i am. I just feel like nothing is in place in a kind of cosmic level (Not like religiously but you get it.) 

In my early teenage years I did some selfharm but I feel like it was just some teen angst thing so i would get attention. Though lately I got a huge urge to hurt myself and to know what death feels like so I started burning myself with cigarettes. It's not that i don't like myself, not even that it's a way to ""feel at least something"". Now that i have these burns over my arms it just feels like I want more of that adrenaline feeling. 

If I could be reborn infinite times, I'd shoot myself with a shotgun until I finally die permanently.  
I don't feel suicidal I feel it's more like masochism but in a non-sexual way.

I crave everything but nothing is made for me. I feel like I'm drifting through time but it's okay, its alright. Everything in my life is starting to go off the road but it's not like I'd care about that. I sleep whenever and wake up whenever. One week I go to sleep very very early. Sometimes I sleep once every two days, sometimes even once every three days. Sometimes i almost sleep the whole weekend. At first it didn't really affect my studying but now it starts to. 

I am not from this planet. Or so I feel like. I observe life around me and try to learn everything about it but it's getting hard since every day i feel like i watch the world through more and more dirty blurry lenses. I feel like i'm sinking into my own head but it doesn't feel bad. In all honesty i am a very anxious person. Maybe it's just my personality or maybe i have a disorder. 

After all i don't really care, None of this feels bad. None of this is an obstacle for my mind but more for the progress of my life. If i was the one choosing i would never do anything.  
The thing that really gets to me is how everyone around me keeps telling me that ""That's life, you can't always just get what you want"". 

Why do i have to get a stable job to get money to pay my bills. Why do i have to be like this and that. I understand that i CAN be myself and i CAN be expressive of my own style and all that and i am that.  
Truthfully no one can be themselves. Yeah you can wear the clothes you like or listen to your own preferred music but after all you are just going to have to grow to be a normal job going, bill paying, social rules following man/woman who is a prisoner of themselves and the system.

I really understand the importance of all the kinds of systems and such to keep order i feel like there's really no other way to keep the world up. 

I love Earth. Nature is beautiful. Humans are beautiful. How we got here, how we have learned so much about things and how we keep building and manipulating everything around us is in my eyes so beautiful. We know so much about everything, there's good people and bad people. Sometimes we need bad people for balance. I don't see tech as a bad thing i think it's just awesome how humankind has gotten this far. We are living the future. I wouldn't change a thing in this world. 

I just wish i could only keep observing this world. I wish someone would build a small pod with eyes and transfer my brain in it so i could just keep observing life around me.

I feel out of place in this world and in my body but i don't want out. I know there's no way out. I know the consequences of me ending it for myself. People would be sad i'm sure. My family would never stop grieving after me. And to be honest i don't even want to end it. Like i said i love the world we live in.

302,mentalhealth,1,"Making up far-fetched scenarios when something good happens to me Hello everybody!  First post on this sub and I'm happy to meet you all!

Not sure if this is the right sub for this though.

Just wanted to get something off my chest: I (27M) noticed I unwillingly ""dive"" into various scenarios when something positive happens to me.  Say for example I add or talk to a girl I like on Facebook.  I feel very happy doing that which makes sense.  However, what I don't like is that my mind jumps to imagining how I would react if I met her parents or how might I take a flight to go visit her (for example if she lives far away).  Or say I go to the gym and do a 10k run and the time is better than last time - which is great!  But then my mind jumps again to a scenario in which I've trained hard for like a year and I'm like super fit and can *always* beat this time - so the first time I'm slower (because tired or whatever reason), the whole thing collapses and I don't feel motivated at all.

I'm thinking It's like my mind extrapolates from a little good thing into this grandiose fantasy and the scary thing is I noticed I need to consciously re-focus else I can end up indulging in the fantasy for a long time.

What I noticed happening in the past is that these fantasies almost never come true - I've even said to myself once that anything that I fantasize about won't come true, so if I want something, I shouldn't fantasize about it.  Still, I don't always notice and what happens is I spend a lot of time thinking about ""how things great would be if X"" but as soon as X doesn't happen then I feel demoralized and depressed.

Searching online this seems like a fairly common occurrence, but I thought I share it here as well.

313,mentalhealth,1,"Is it PTSD? I posted a few days ago about severe social anxiety/agoraphobia, but a friend said that it sounds like I have PTSD, which may have resulted in everything else over time.

In short: I was bullied severely (""bullied."" It was abuse). I was stabbed in the arm at one point and had my arm pulled out of it's socket on one occasion resulting in a cast for about 6-8 weeks. I turned into an alcoholic just to make it through high school, and I survived with my emotions buried for years. Then, once I stopped drinking, I found I had all this unresolved rage/emotional distress. For the past 7 years, I've both struggled to remember the specifics of the events, but also had moments of total clarity, that I can only describe as watching a movie of my worst moments with surround sound. Sometimes I get pulled in unwillingly, and other times it's more like a daydream that I can break out of if I try. There's also a certain type of person that ""triggers"" me, (very ""laddish/broish"" straight men) as they remind me of the worst of the abusers. I have a lot of rage/negativity toward these types of people, although I don't know them, and I often exit places they're present because I'm seconds away from a panic attack. 

I've never even considered PTSD, as it's usually something you only hear about soldiers having and I'd never want to insult them by claiming I have it... but does it sound like PTSD?

314,mentalhealth,1,"My grandmother brought a print of this across the Atlantic with her when she uprooted her London life to marry my Mississippi Delta-ian grandpa after the war. It hung in my bathroom growing up and, although it took years to grasp every big word and prose, I find myself repeating it often. GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

- Max Ehrmann 

Read, then read again. THEN read once more. Repeat until your soul accepts the truths it's hearing. You ARE a child of the universe. NO LESS than the trees and the stars.

Almost on any occasion I try to help him or give him constructive criticism, he lashes out. As an example, he was trying to learn the piano and I would try to give him some advice on hand placement, or other things. But even that makes him yell loudly. He usually yells, ""you're so annoying, why do keep bothering me, "" anyways he gets extremely angered at small things that I say to him. It is like he thinks everything I say is coming from a negative place. Sometimes he does't know when to stop. Or when something gets old. He will start with a joke that is funny at first, but he sees us giving him attention and often takes it to the extreme causing my dad to get upset. If we don't do something with him he often gets upset. He sometimes acts like we treat him as he is nothing and he complains. He needs to realize how lucky he is to be in the family he is in.

319,mentalhealth,1,"I am unable to think creatively in any way, and my wife is incredibly concerned I've fried my brain in some way. Is this possible, and if so, what kind of doctor should I see about getting it fixed? I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but if not, feel free to point me in the right direction. I'm a 29 (close to 30) year old white man living in the USA, I'm on testosterone replacement therapy, I drink 2-3 times a month with friends, and I smoke cannabis 1-2 times a month to help with occasional sleep issues because my TRT makes me very amped up. I quit smoking about two years ago, and now I smoke Juul (nicotine) daily. Other than that I have never taken any drugs with the exception of the occasional multivitamin.

Long story short, I can't think creatively. I've always been a very concrete/rigid thinker. For example, it's always been difficult for me to understand things like improv comedy or musical 'jam sessions' that don't involve following sheet music, or cooking that doesn't involve following a recipe or guide. I've been this way as long as I can remember. However, up until I was about 22 I was a musician and also an artist, and while it was difficult for me to create new works, I pushed past the mental blocks and was able to complete dozens of long-term projects.

When I was 21 I had a major psychotic break from stress, that lasted about two months, and there were lingering effects from it for several months afterward. About six months after my psychotic break I realized I couldn't write music anymore, and creating art was very difficult for me unless I was copying someone else's style. I have no idea if that was related, I asked my therapist and my dad and both said losing your creative streak is just something that happens when you get older. I haven't had any issues related to psychosis since then, but my wife is concerned that the stress I was under in that two month period fried my ability to think creatively, and that I may need to re-learn how to think, as if I were a baby that never learned it in the first place. I'm not sure if that's how brains work, but at this point I'd be willing to try anything.

For the past six or seven years it's been extreme. I can't drive anywhere unless I have a destination in mind (so 'just going for a drive' gives me excessive anxiety unless I plan out several destinations). I can't 'get creative' in bed, I can only perform actions I've seen other people do (either in porn or otherwise). I can't make certain foods even though I'm physically capable of doing so, because I have a mental block in place saying it's not possible. I'm in school for Computer Science and it's borderline impossible for me because most of CS is solving puzzles that haven't been solved before, and I can't visualize solutions for things if I've never seen the solution before.

I can't make playlists, write music or make art, be spontaneous, be romantic, or do anything that requires coming up with a new idea. I was never really any good at most of those things to begin with, but prior to age 22ish I could at least try and while it was difficult, I'd usually get at least part of it right.

I have a history of psych admissions and was taken out of high school to be hospitalized. I graduated through a tutor that was sent to my bed on the unit and later to my house. A year and a half later, I was stable enough to accept my place at university! It was exciting to be independent and I managed a 3.93 first semester, but we're one week into second semester and I can already tell this isn't going to be easy.

I haven't attended any classes (missed 12 sessions so far). I cry myself to sleep some nights and sleep until 1 or 2 in the afternoon. I don't want to screw up my academic transcript, but I don't want to go back on my meds or engage in therapy because I somehow always end up worse off.  
It's so tempting to just throw my life away—go home, lay in bed all day, lose weight and refuse help until I waste away in a state hospital. That's what I deserve.

324,mentalhealth,1,"So me and my parents thought I might have ADD and I feel like my doctors have no idea what the frickitty frack they're talking about. This year I started Uni and I've been having trouble concentrating on school when I'm studying. Like, not getting distracted by my phone, sounds, everything really.  
My old psychologist from when I as 12 thought I might have ADD but then when she heard how well I did in school she digressed.   
My best friend has ADD and she said it wouldn't be a big surprise if I did have ADD (and she knows me very well).  
Every only test I fill out it says there's a big fat chance I have ADD.  
This was not the case with the test I filled out at the doctors office. This was kind of like a pre-test. But when I filled that one out with half of the questions I just didn't really know what the right answers were. I thought I wasn't that often distracted, just with school, but then my parents were like 'sweetheart remember this and this and this and this and this?' and I realized that yes, I do get distracted a lot. So the test wasn't totally accurate. And I only needed about 2 or 3 points more to possibly have ADD.  
So I wanted to redo the test. And my parents even want me to get officially tested, since ADD also runs in the family and it's just nice to know whether I can rule ADD out or not.   
But when I asked my doctor about it, he said 'You need three things to have ADD. Impulsivity, distractedness and something else (I don't remember). You only have one of them so you most probably don't have it and it's gonna be a waste of money.' Even though impulsivity is part of ADHD and distinguishes ADHD from ADD. It's like he had no idea what he was talking about. And he was like 'Why would you need a label? What are you gonna do when you get a label? Just take medicine?' and I was like 'Well... I mean if it helps me... Sure? And I want the label because I want to know.'' 'But why not just work on your problem of distractedness? You don't need the label.'' ANd in my head I was like 'Well.. if you know it's because of ADD you might have a better way to treat it?' but I didn't say that because social anxiety and it seemed as if he refused to give me the test (which turns out wasn't the case, he was just trying to be reasonable and wanted me to think it through).  


And then last time at the doctors office with the lady I regularly talk to (kind of therapist-like but not really) she asked about my recent grades, and I boasted that I got only one 7 out of 10 and an 8, 9, and 8.5, and she immidiately was like 'see this is why I think you probably dont have ADD. People with ADD usually don't do this well in school.' and I immidiately told her that my other friend has ADD, she studied way less than me (I study about 6 hours a day just summarising everything, and like all through the semester, not just right before the exams and my friend only studied about a five days leading up to the exams, with only summaries from the internet) and I got an 8 and she mostly got 6's. So I was like 'Well my friend has ADD but she also did very well'.  
'That's because ADD is different for everyone'. And I wanted to straight up yell at her and tell her 'Yeah well MAYBE ITS LIKE THAT WITH ME TOO?' Plus apperently (so I've read) women with ADD ofteb manage to hide it well and can still do well in school. So I was like 'Woman you're a sweetheart but you have no idea what the F you're talking about'. Didn't say that out loud. But I thought it.

I did get a referance after all though because 'if this is really what you want (sneaky headshake) I will write you a note to get tested'.

332,mentalhealth,1,"Need ideas for coping after major arguments So this weekend a casual get together with friends went completely sideways. We had all been drinking, and only one witness. Shit happened so fast, I believe we were all truly floored. The friend who witnessed the blow out, initially told all that I initiated it. This was not the case, and she confirmed that to my husband the following day.

My ""friend"" innocently enough put her hands around my face and lovingly told me to stop making everything she says out to be negative. We had a recent disagreement that we decided not to discuss and just move forward. So when she started this talk, it immediately triggered me. But she followed it up with getting in my face and screaming at me that she never wanted to hear a particular word ever come out of my mouth again...Bipolar.

A couple weeks ago, I briefly explained that I had just been diagnosed, and was struggling with feeling shame. Told her I was learning a new vocabulary and still getting the gist of it. It wasn't really discussed beyond that, or again since.

This ""friend"" isn't the type to allow others to speak much...but I'm sure I muttered a statement or so back about moving forward, but that she didn't get a pass to tear me down...that we obviously need to resolve it another time...

She continued screaming accusing me of lying about having cancer (stage 4 breast cancer, thriving 3 years now)....and it went to hell in a handbasket after that. I initially tried to tell her that we weren't going to do this now...but I readily defended myself after that.

We managed to pull it together, offer brief apologies, and left abruptly.  Thought it was done. Pretty much felt confident that a parting of ways was in order, but didn't need it to be a big deal.

The next day she gave my number to one of her friends, which initiated a group chat stirring a ton of drama. My husband was included. The sticking point here is this woman and my husband have been close friends for a number of years. The group texts blew up our phones with 43 messages over two hours. Their mission was to try to expose lies to my husband. Fact is that while I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of, I'm brutally honest. Information is being shared with her that is 100% true, hurtful, embarrassing, and can affect quite a few people. 

So I have no love lost over ending my friendship with this circle. My husband has been put in a very uncomfortable position, and I feel horribly for that. He is quite upset with the four ""friends"" that spent hours harassing me during our Sunday. But I kind of doubt he just wants to call it done. My man has a huge heart, and huge capacity for forgiveness. 

Just seeking advice on how to overcome the emotional hangover of it all? I can't concentrate, so my usual strategies to distract my mind just aren't working. 

My anxiety is in overdrive and I am overwhelmed with how awful this must be for my husband. I know I'm not giving them another moment to drain my energy or peace. Just really nervous about helping my husband cope.

I'm at my breaking point and planning my death in detail. I called a suicide hotline and she said it sounds like borderline personality disorder.

Then I have family members who don't think I have any kind of mental illness.

342,mentalhealth,1,"Someone mistook my social anxiety with pride... and it hurts I already made a post today, but I have a lot I need to get off my chest today and I couldn't find a way to made this fit in my other rant...

So I have been having an horrible week but today was probably the worst... I live with my partner and with roommates... This morning my boyfriend got out of our room and talked to our roommate. Apparently, this week when I cooked for myself I forgot to clean part of a mess I made. I had an accident and spilled something. I cleaned up what I saw, but I didn't think to check inside the cupboard. My roommate got pissed about it and spoke to my boyfriend about this. Boyfriend gets back in the room and confront me about it. I explained I didn't knew it spilled inside and would gladly clean it. Since I have a phobia of being judged (social anxiety in a nutshell) and my roommate was still using the kitchen, I really did not wanted to show my face out of my room while she was still mad about it, so I said I would do it as soon as she leave the kitchen and my boyfriend accused me of being too prideful... In his mind if I did not wanted to clean up, it was because I did not wanted to ''bow'' to her and admit my fault... He even argued with me when I tried to explain that I was terrified... **''I'm sorry but no... its not anxiety, its just your pride, I know you, you're always like that''**

That statement broke me... The way I see it, every time something like that happened, he just assumed it was pride... Obviously I have pride, everyone has.... but mine is broken because of many past experiences and mental health issues, but I still admit my faults. In fact I even take too much of the blame in arguments just to make the argument settle down quicker so I can flee. So stepping on my pride.. its almost a daily thing to me... I have to deal with apocalyptic mindset, depression, and overwhelming fear of judgement and now I will worry like crazy about seeming too prideful... I really could use a break of this right now...

&amp;#x200B;

347,mentalhealth,1,"Suicide becomes more and more irresistible every passing day My life has no direction. 

I'm in my mid-twenties currently living with my mother and sister. It's a toxic environment. My sister is emotionally abusive and impulsive. She outwardly expresses her anger; yelling, screaming, slamming doors, and occasionally, throwing objects around. She loves to be get the last say whenever she gets into an argument with others. She brings me anxiety. My mother is close-minded and cannot sympathize that I have depression. Even though I live in the same house, I do not talk to either of them or go out my room whenever they are out of theirs.

In fact, I haven't been outside of my house for several months now. I can't find a reason to be outside. I no longer contact friends. I just sit in front of my computer applying to jobs.

I'm still unemployed. My last position came to an end early last year. I had to leave because of a medical condition. It's been over 6 months since I started applying for entry- to mid-level developer positions. The career switch has been hard. The majority of recruiters want to see experience and dismiss my application because I do not have any professional development experience. And if it wasn't the lack of professional development experience, then it was either my incomplete college degree or gaps in my resume that probably solidified my rejection.

I'm burnt out of applying to jobs. Whether I apply to 100 jobs or no jobs, the result is still the same. I experience disinterest, lack of concentration, and unwillingness to work on new coding projects daily. I experience constant fatigue and loss of appetite, which adds to my lack of productivity. 

On top of that I'm carrying the weight of my past regrets and failures. I couldn't finish my college degree because I was unable to pay for tuition costs. I also have gaps in my resume because of my major depression. I have student loan debt that I cannot pay. My medical condition is persistent, but I cannot go to the doctor because I cannot pay for it.

The only thing I got going for me is the completion of a coding bootcamp. In hindsight, however, I wish I never attended the bootcamp. All it did was exchange up my hope of moving up the economic ladder with debt.

348,mentalhealth,1,"The Key to Happiness Just want to start off by saying that this post is in regards to a recent YouTube video of mine. If that bothers you, then by all means feel free to exit out of here.

The ancient Stoics understood that there's only one thing that we can control in life, and that's ourselves or in other words, our perspective.

We can't control how people act toward us. We can't control what happens to us. We can't control the traffic. We can't control the weather. All that we can control is how we see those things. And in the eyes of a Stoic, that means to accept them as they are. No need to fuss.

That's point number one.

Point number two is that we can enhance that perspective by being grateful for the good things in our lives. 

We all have something that we can be grateful for. By focusing on the goodness we put ourselves into a much more positive state, and thus improve our perspective.

So long story short the key to happiness, or at least the most important one, is perspective. How we see ourselves and our lives, greatly affects how we feel.

358,mentalhealth,1,"No motivation for anything Let me start of by saying I’m here for advice and to just let me write out my story because I’ve done it before and it helped.

Now for the problem. For the past months since school has started I don’t have any motivation, not just for homework or studying but for everything. I don’t feel like leaving my bed or to eat breakfast for example. I’ve started not attending some classes because I just don’t see the reason why I have to go there which demotivates (I don’t even know if that’s a word) me. I don’t want to go to the barber, don’t feel like hanging out with most of my friends and am just not motivated to keep track of what I eat, which was a habit of mine. And of course I don’t feel like studying, hand in my assignments on time or do my homework, but it’s not that I don’t want to, I just don’t feel pressure to do it anymore. 

I feel like it has to do with me being in my senior year now. I just want to be done with it all. School stresses me out, but I also don’t feel pressure to succeed. I was super excited to go to university and live on my own, which motivated me in my junior year. But now that’s all gone. And because I lost my motivation for school, I’ve lost my motivation for everything else, it feels like. 

Another problem is that I party a lot since senior year has started. I’ve looked in my agenda (yes I plan my free time, I don’t know why) and I’ve seen that I’ve gotten drunk or at least tipsy every weekend for the past 5 months. It’s not that I don’t feel grateful for having friends and it’s always a lot of fun, but I never feel like doing anything the day after.

364,mentalhealth,1,"I fall in love with literally anyone who gives me attention Note: I got super duper off topic. 

I think that the title above is the best shortest summary of it but I will go on anyway.

It really doesn't take much, a few words and a few minutes. You don't have to say much or even compliment me. Just look at me and ask me what my name is. There doesn't need to be anything more. Any sign of genuine interest in me and who I am is all it takes for me to pay attention to you for months. I become aware of you and your existence and start thinking about it. For example I have a crush on a girl I didn't see for almost two years - I wasn't even friends with her.

It's odd because as soon as anyone notices or talks to me I want to run. I panic but try to remain calm and normal. 

I also know that this isn't real love. It's some kind of a desperate obsession because I truly love attention despite how much it terrifies me.

I do what I can to remain rational. But why am I like this in the first place? Is it my shitty relationship with my mum? My lack of a relationship with my dad? The fact that I don't think anyone I have ever been friends with has ever really liked me as a person? Does it have anything to do with the fact that my life took a complete 180 degrees turn in a flash and I became so alone? Not even realising that it was an issue. That anything was an issue, that everything wasn't ok?

Honestly at this point I think I'm just a mess. Not just because of this but because of other things. I can't talk to people, I don't know how. I panic and don't know what to say. Sometimes I just feel so depressed and while all of that sucks I think the impact of time is what plays the biggest part. I don't even know when this started, it has been years. I tried to get help but there is always something in the way, and when there isn't, it's always the fear that stops me. Do I even need to speak to a professional I ask myself? Am I wasting resources. I know it's not rational but I can't get a hold of myself whenever I try to make that phone call.

I don't think much about any of this, I try to avoid it. I forget about my anxiety untill I have to speak to another human being.  I forget about so many things. I even started having memory issues recently. I can't even point out all the things wrong with me because my mind is blank 99% of the time. Just someone sitting next to me on a bus makes it hard to breath. I don't know how I will get a job, how I will live on my own. 

However despite all this I love myself so much most of the time. I look in the mirror and I couldn't be happier to be me. Not because of my appearance but because I like who I am as a person despite the flaws I have. Yet at the same time maybe I am insecure on some level? I can't really tell but I probably am.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Maybe it's a rant or maybe I just want advice. TBH writing about myself and getting this out is just nice.

367,mentalhealth,1,"What to do about bad friends? Need advice I live alone and for the most part, I work on a very small team and spend the majority of my day alone. Because of that, I place a lot of value on my friends. The problem? I don’t really have any.

I do have friends via work and one I play video games with online so that helps but they all live far away (I don’t have a car and it’s an hour drive to get to any of them because they live in the opposite direction from work). 

The real problem is my college friends. I moved up to the city so that I could see them more; four of six of the guys I lived with, my best friends in the world, all live here. Then one moved to Kenya and didn’t invite me to his going away party. The others live not even a 15 minute drive away and I am always the one to reach out. Not once have they engaged first and it makes me feel really shitty and like a huge burden to them. One of them even works at the same company as me and I haven’t seen him since November.

I’m used to getting the runaround and I always hear “I’ve been so busy” which I’m not buying as an excuse anymore. I hold my tongue but I’m always thinking “really? You’re so busy you didn’t have time to send a five second text? You’re telling me that not once did you have a single moment to yourself to watch a movie or play video games when instead you could reach out? Which again takes five seconds”

For the past two months, I’ve been doing an experiment: I’ve resolved to not text my friends for at least three months to see if they even remember me. It’s already been two months and nothing. Which leads me to my question: what do I do about it? Do I just let them fade into the background and try to forget or move on? Or in the future, say at four months, should I confront them and ask point blank if we’re even friends anymore?

This has happened to me a lot and I’m struggling to understand why. I have so many friends, outside my college friends, that have ghosted new for inexplicable reasons. One didn’t respond to me for six months and I honestly thought he had died or moved. He ended up texting me a week before he went to Amsterdam for grad school and the only question I had for him was “what the hell man?” to which he didn’t have any answer. Another friend at my old job did the same thing; I was actively trying to get him a job at my new job because he’s pretty skilled and he just ignored me for four months and when he did get back in contact, he had no excuse. I understand if something really bad happens like a parent dying but that’s never the case; all I get is a shrug and a half baked apology. It happened again recently but thankfully not as bad with a girl I used to be into that I’ve been trying to hang out with and she ignored me for two weeks and couldn’t even extend the courtesy of telling me she was busy.

Why do people treat me this way? I’m not a pushover by any means, in fact I’m widely regarded as a “force of nature” and a somewhat intense individual. But I struggle to understand why people abandon me and just forget about me. Is it because I don’t have any social media like Facebook? Or am I just that shitty of a person that no one wants to be around me? 

It makes me really really sad.

376,mentalhealth,1,"Constantly descending into strange foggy states where the borders of my personality are incredibly ambiguous  

I have periods of clarity where I grow a lot in a day or two and then a massive downward spike into confusion and I lose myself completely. I've accepted this pattern but I've found out I can accept and embrace it as much as I want, it is actually a problem. I tell myself its my unique little thing I have to deal with, everyone has them and that's okay. I also can completely disconnect with the world, control my thoughts so much that I only think certain things and the world becomes a magical harmless place. But this isn't life and those methods come at a rather large cost.

I'm the crazy guy at this point and honestly I don't really care, its the only way I feel okay and stop myself from hurting others, or as least thinking I am. I have been to so many strange places in my mind and I've trimmed off the physical world to only what I thought was absolutely essential. I will ignore people, ignore social constructs, ignore pain, ignore literally anything I need to in order to have stability for an extended period of time. It killed me at first to do this because I would be hurting others, but I figured they'd get used to me like this and I'd just be known as that guy, plus I was harmless enough right? I have no choice to ignore my mixed feelings and doubts because my quality of life was my excuse.

I've tried millions of things to fix this ""problem"". Including not seeing it as a problem but something to learn from and adapt to but unfortunately to no avail. I've of course done the typical google search but few people have posted what seems similar. I read piece on disassociate disorder which seemed eerily similar but I'm extremely hesitant to suggest I have anything wrong with me at all without the opinion of others.

I've done some research on the spectrum and I feel that is a possibility, I have brought this up with a few friends and family but they are adamant that's not the case. Although they are not professionals of course. My councillor who I saw twice was not much help because on 1/2 days I had clarity. On the day I was confused she agreed with my suggestion that the spectrum was a possibility but I was forwarded onto a doctor and as I felt clarity that day she sent me away with a referral to more sessions but essentially wrote me off as a silly teenager who will figure it out eventually and left me with a few half hearted responses about managing yourself through your actions; diet, meditation and exercise. She didn't buy any of it and instead changed the topic to getting an sti check. That kinda hurt because it took a lot for me to put myself in that position. It left me with little hope for the future and a forced outlook on being content. I turned 21 recently.

Apologies if this is unclear or confusing, I don't really know if this makes any sense. I'll inevitably read this tomorrow and be confused myself. I've tried not to answer my own thoughts and questions in this post but apologies if I've fallen into that habit again.

378,mentalhealth,1,"I made my first step to overcome my overthinking Note: this post got really long, but the title explains most of it and I wanted to share my accomplisment. 

I struggle a lot with overthinking, mostly about social events. When I’m at school, or at work or just any place with a lot of well known people around I really quickly say yes to hangout plans or ask if I may come as well. I usually regret doing this right after, because I start telling myself they can have a far better time with other people/without you. Most of the time I keep it at that and just don’t mention anything about it anymore, hoping my friends will forget I said yes. However, if they remember, I try to be truthful and say something like: “I don’t think I add something,” or, “It’s better for you to spend your time without me or something.”

Anyway, to give some context. I was at school with friends and they made plans to do something, but I wasn’t really taking part in the conversation. They did invite me to hang out with them, which felt really nice because it had been a while since we as a group hanged out. Later that day, I was put into a group chat with all the people that would come, but I noticed I was added later then everyone else. This already made me start thinking they didn’t want to have me there, but one of them quickly remembered (and in my head probably regretted) to invite me as well. I really didn’t think I should go, but I said to myself, just go and have a good time. When I cycled to my friends house I constantly said to myself, “Why are you going, they don’t want you there. They just wanted to be nice. It was a gesture, not a real invitation.” etc. I then stepped off my bike and wanted to call my friend that I wasn’t coming. After standing in the freezing cold for 10 minutes, still overthinking if I should go and also overthinking if I should call or just don’t go without saying anything, because “they won’t even notice that you’re not there. And if they notice, they’ll just be glad you didn’t show up”, I finally got back to cycling and had a great night. 

It was an real eyeopener for me and my first step to overcome my overthinking. 

TLDR: Struggle a lot with overthinking. Got invited to hang out with friends. Started to overthink a lot, which in the past would have stopped me from hanging out, but overcame my weird mindset and just went to my friends. Ended having a great night and also showed myself I shouldn’t overthink everything so much.",step overcome overthinking note post got really long title explains wanted share accomplisment struggle lot overthinking social event m school work just place lot known people really quickly say yes hangout plan ask come usually regret doing right start telling far better time people time just don t mention anymore hoping friend forget said yes remember try truthful say like don t think add s better spend time context school friend plan wasn t really taking conversation did invite hang felt really nice group hanged later day group chat people come noticed added later start thinking didn t want quickly remembered head probably regretted invite really didn t think said just good time cycled friend house constantly said going don t want just wanted nice gesture real invitation stepped bike wanted friend wasn t coming standing freezing cold minute overthinking overthinking just don t saying won t notice notice ll just glad didn t finally got cycling great night real eyeopener step overcome overthinking tldr struggle lot overthinking got invited hang friend started overthink lot past stopped hanging overcame weird mindset just went friend ended having great night showed shouldn t overthink

381,mentalhealth,1,"Is it actually possible to get rid of social anxiety? Read description please I've had social anxiety almost my whole life. When I started school when I was six I had it, I was always picked on because I couldn't stand up for myself.

In a sense of body mass, she nears the upper spectrum of the normal BMI at a short height. Currently, she's working hard on the weight loss aspect of her insecurity (taking on safe diets and exercising) but her bone structure cannot be changed either way.

386,mentalhealth,1,"Things are looking up I’ve posted multiple times about how I have a hard time opening up to others and talking about my problems to my loved ones and not getting help from a professional.

Well, good news! I’m getting help! I recently got in touch with my school counselor and I couldn’t be more excited! Our first (and only so far) session didn’t really discuss a lot. He wanted to focus on getting to know me and understand my situation while also introducing himself and we basically were just getting to know each other so that I was more comfortable with talking to him. He was so nice that I nearly broke own because I forgot how nice it is to actually talk to someone about my problems. I don’t have to worry about burdening him because it’s his job to listen to my problems and it makes me feel a lot better about venting.

Even though we didn’t discuss much about my problems, I’m really excited to see him again. He gave me some advice about my ruminating thoughts and how the mind is like an iceberg. Your conscious is the tip of the iceberg and the your subconscious is everything below the water and sometimes the problem is below the water and harder to see and you just have to break down the iceberg to realize just how big the problem really is.

I haven’t told my parents that I’m seeing my counselor yet, and I don’t plan on telling them for awhile until something serious comes up (like having to get a proper diagnosis or whatever).

In other news, I’ve been pretty happy because a friend I haven’t seen for a while got in touch with me recently. He was driving home yesterday and he was feeling worried so he called me so that he could focus on something else. I really like him (a little more than as a friend) and so it meant a lot to me that he reached to me of all people. We talked about a lot of things, especially about our mental health and we talked about how our state of minds are very similar right now. We’re both stuck in this time loop, like we’re TOO stuck in the present. It’s a little hard to explain, but once you experience it you know exactly what I’m talking about. I just felt overwhelming emotions after he hung up and I just wanted to give him a hug and make sure he was okay because we are best friends and I don’t ever want to see him hurt and I want him to know how much I love him.

Other than that, I still feel like shit but I’ve come to accept it and that I’m going to be okay. I’m going to get better and I’m going to be happy someday. I’ve come to accept that being sad isn’t a bad thing and it’s something we all experience but we get over it eventually. Everything is temporary, even when it seems like it’ll never end.

So if you’re having a bad day, keep going. Is it difficult? Yeah, of course it is.

391,mentalhealth,1,"How do you prevent your mental compartmentalization from suddenly failing? For the past several years, I found that it makes my life significantly easier to just compartmentalize away all of my problems. Once I started doing that, it was like a huge weight was lifted off of my shoulder.

Usually I would release every so often and just breakdown in private in a very cathartic manner. 

I’ve always been able to keep the bottle closed until I was ready to just release; however, some shit went down today and I am finding it incredibly hard to keep the lid on. I have work I need to do now but I am struggling to keep the lid on. I’ll be able to release tomorrow night but I have a lot of stuff I need to get done between now and then. I have work I need to finish up now then I have to go to sleep because I have school all day tomorrow (In uni). 

I’m trying to do my work but keep feeling tears and sadness and I just don’t want to deal with this right now. How can I better keep my emotions in check? I have a decent bit of liquor. Would a shot or two help ease off? I’ve never drank in this kind of state before so I don’t wanna do anything stupid. I *can’t* miss school tomorrow.

392,mentalhealth,1,"Nothing in Life Feels Real Anymore I feel as though this needs a sort of preface, over the course of this past year, I've been reading a lot of self help books at my library, and I can't really afford therapy though I'm looking into ones my insurance listed as accepting theirs. Overall, the books never gave any insight into how I feel. In many cases I feel at peace, but like a daze. I zone out constantly, and I'm aware that I'm not taking in the situations around me, I'm not present, and yet I'm hyper aware of the small details, like the time of day, and that I'm still me. Walking around in my daily life feels like I'm dreaming, and it's not a good dream. 

My personal relationships, like the ones with my family are crippling, and I don't register the words I'm speaking until it's too late. Yet on the flip side, I recently reconnected with a childhood friend that's been trying to get clean from black for the past five years, and she told me that whenever I'm around I inspire her to be a better person and she doesn't crave black when I'm there. So my less up to date connections are wilting, and my past ones are flourishing under my eyes, and it's so conflicting. I want so badly to have a better relationship with my parents and brothers, and as soon as someone I lost communication with comes back, they worship the ground I walk on. 

None of this feels real, and thusly it bounces off of me, rolling off like rain on a windshield, because deep down it doesn't effect me, and I just want to know why every single time something happens to me or around me, it ends in me feeling as though i'm dreaming and living in auto pilot. It's hard to function, it's hard to work, because for some reason I can't seem to stay present in my own life.  Whenever I think about my own feelings, it scares me, because a sense of apathy sets in over all aspects of my life, and find myself not even caring if I lose the roof over my head, and not caring if I have anything to eat. If anyone has any idea what's wrong with me, or has been through this, I'd like to know, because it's hard not to feel alone when I'm not even aware of my own life.",life feel real anymore feel need sort preface course past year reading lot self help book library t really afford therapy m looking one insurance listed accepting theirs overall book gave insight feel case feel peace like daze zone constantly m aware m taking situation m present m hyper aware small detail like time day m walking daily life feel like m dreaming s good dream personal relationship like one family crippling don t register word m speaking s late flip recently reconnected childhood friend s trying clean black past year told m inspire better person doesn t crave black m date connection wilting past one flourishing eye s conflicting want badly better relationship parent brother soon lost communication come worship ground walk feel real thusly bounce rolling like rain windshield deep doesn t effect just want know single time happens end feeling m dreaming living auto pilot s hard function s hard work reason t stay present life think feeling scare sense apathy set aspect life caring lose roof head caring eat idea s wrong d like know s hard feel m aware life

395,mentalhealth,1,"Worries about having kids Hi All

I'm a OCD/BDD sufferer who is, right now, doing okay. But obviously I still have obsessions and anxieties all the time regardless of how well I think I'm doing. 

The main thing I worry about all the time now is about getting married and having kids. I'm 33 and my girlfriend is 27 and in a couple years she wants to start a family.

I am petrified of getting married and having kids. It's something I've always theoretically wanted but as I've gotten older and gotten closer to the real deal I find myself recoiling from it and worrying about it constantly. 

There's many different reasons why I'm afraid of it, not least of which is that I straight up will not be able to physically tolerate the mental and physical demands of raising children, the sleep deprivation, the lack of alone time (I'm a serious introvert), etc. Also the fact that I'm the third of three generations of severe mental illness on my dad's side (my Korean war veteran grandfather drank himself to death at 60, his son ((my dad)) died at 57 after a lifetime of severe mental illness) and then there's me, and I would hate to bestow this pain on another child. 

Then there's the fact that most marriages end in divorce, and I don't really believe in the commitment of marriage, I believe in just taking it one day at a time and hoping for the best, which isn't really conducive to raising a kid for 18-20 years straight. 

Then there's also the fact that she wants 3 kids and I want 0-1 kids. 

I also worry about not having kids, and all the old folks who claim that I'll be lonely and regretful if I don't.

I also have the sense of running out of time and I already feel some level of shame being the age I am and not having kids already, and then worrying about what people will think of me if I have kids in my late thirties (even though many people in my family don't have kids yet and are older than me, or have had kids older than me). 

Anyway this is just a vent. I remember being stressed about everything at any stage I've been at in my life, so this probably isn't any different.",worry having kid hi m ocd bdd sufferer right doing okay obviously obsession anxiety time regardless think m doing main thing worry time getting married having kid m girlfriend couple year want start family petrified getting married having kid s theoretically wanted gotten older gotten closer real deal recoiling worrying constantly s different reason m afraid straight able physically tolerate physical demand raising child sleep deprivation lack time m introvert fact m generation severe illness dad s korean war veteran grandfather drank death son dad died lifetime severe illness s hate bestow pain child s fact marriage end divorce don t really believe commitment marriage believe just taking day time hoping best isn t really conducive raising kid year straight s fact want kid want kid worry having kid old folk claim ll lonely regretful don t sense running time feel level shame age having kid worrying people think kid late thirty people family don t kid older kid older just vent remember stressed stage life probably isn t different
396,mentalhealth,1,"How do I know if my partner is safe? My partner and I have quite a turbulent relationship. She has borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety and ocd. We recently had quite a bit falling out after she locked me out and left me to sleep on the stairs of our apartment building. I reluctantly called my mum to come and get me as I couldn’t sleep on the stairs and she wasn’t going to be letting me back in any time soon (it’s happened plenty of times and I have slept in my car for days - but I didn’t have my keys this time). This was all over me having a bad stomach and needing to use the toilet which she had a panic attack about (I am not allowed to use the toilet to shit at home because she has a panic attack every single time). I have stupidly been feeding into this by using the toilet at the shop every time and holding it in for days on end which has pretty much fucked my bowel up. 

So I’m currently 35 miles away at my mums house and have been for 11 days now and we have grown quite distant. We have been talking pretty much every day and she has been struggling a lot. She tells me that she hasn’t eaten and isn’t washing herself properly. She’s basically gone into a deep depression and is now completely emotionally numb. She isn’t sure she loves me anymore or if she’s just depressed and can’t feel it. I’m trying to support her as best I can from my mums. Both of my legs are currently in plaster so I can’t drive, otherwise I would be driving to see her several times a week. I asked her if she wanted to come and see me on Saturday and she agreed. While we were together she was just extremely uncomfortable and nervous, she said it was like I was a stranger and we were on a first date. She then became angry and said that she had been dependent on substances and benzos this whole time. I told her that that is probably why she’s so numb at the moment because she has been taking so many benzos each day. She got frustrated and said that’s the way life is because i CHOSE to leave her. I got upset and said that I did not choose to leave, I had no choice. I’ve been asking to come home but she doesn’t want me home if she has to care for me in any way (my casts, emotionally, dodgy stomach etc). Therefore we are holding out until I have myself sorted before I move back in.

Each day for the past few days, she is keeping me up all night by telling me that she is suicidal at around 10-11pm. She will then turn her phone off and will not communicate with me until the morning. I can’t contact her parents as they have asked me not to involve them in this. They are tired of her behaviour and they don’t know how to manage her. She has behaved like this before when we did not live together and would send me messages that would worry me and then would turn her phone off. I would call the police and she would answer the door in her pyjamas and she had been sleeping the whole time. So it looks like I’m wasting police time and I’m just a complete idiot. If I call the police while I’m at my mums they will most likely section her as she is currently under the mental health team and has been for the last 4 years. They have told her that with her current presentation, any concerns for welfare and they will look at assessing her for hospital admission. I don’t want that, we both know that if she goes into hospital she will most likely kill herself. I have worked in mental health for and I don’t trust them to keep her safe. 

She has told me that she resents me for being able to just carry on while we go through this. I feel like she is making sure that I am not comfortable at my mums. When she came to see me, she didn’t bring any of my belongings when she knew that I have nothing here not even a book or something to keep me occupied. I had to go out and buy new clothes. She is angry with me for choosing to leave but will then go back on that and tell me she knows that I didn’t have a choice and she’s sorry for locking me out. She tells me that it’s going to change and she’s going to manage her anger with me and will just let me live my life (I can’t go to visit my parents most of the time, even going to a family funeral was difficult as she didn’t want me to leave her and I turned up 15 minutes late). She is completely dependent on me and I’m trying to get her to be more independent before we try again with our relationship. I think she senses this and has just increased the pressure. After I saw her on Saturday she told me that she had jumped off a bridge when she got home but she was okay. She walked to her car and drove home. I don’t know how believable that is, I don’t know if she said that to get a reaction from me or if she actually has jumped. She then turned her phone off all night and my mum had to sit up with me until 4am because I was freaking out. I eventually called her bluff and went to sleep and she woke up in the morning and was absolutely fine. Last night she told me that she was going to wake up at 2am and kill herself because she can’t make it through the night. I offered to come and stay with her but she said it would make it worse because of the relationship problems we are having and she would just have to ‘hope’ that she can make it through. I honestly just feel so trapped and im in turmoil every day and it’s really taking its toll on me. My mum is getting frustrated that I am letting her manipulate me but I don’t know how much of it is manipulation and I don’t want to call her bluff and something happen to her. She would be so angry with me for contacting the police or the crisis team. Last night she told me she just wanted her old life back (in and out of hospitals and psychiatric intensive care). She doesn’t want to live a ‘normal’ life of working and family etc. She likes the chaos and the drama, that’s how she has grown up. I’m just tying her down and trying to give her a better life, which probably isn’t what she wants anymore.

Last time I went I was 18 - BY MYSELF (I wouldnt dare doing it now) and i had a great time with my family and didnt have these worries that I have now. Minding that when I was there we got burgled whilst we were sleeping but it didnt seem to affect me then and idk if it does now? 

Lately ive been more and more anxious in every day life but i feel like its because an obstruction now because i really want to see my family in brazil. Im scared of the long journey flight there, scared of the mosquitoes, the snakes (heard a family friend nearly got bitten), the spiders and im scared of getting robbed (as ive forgotten the language a bit and me and my bf stand out like a sore thumb). 

All of these thoughts have arised and i never used to take much heed but now i've got older and ive had 2 immediate family members pass away - im just always on edge about my safety - heck ive even turned into a hyperchondriac! 
Its as if every few months i add another layer of bubblewrap to keep me safe. 

Questions:
1. how can i start stepping towards being less anxious about everything? 
2. Is there any underlying issues that is causing me to be more anxious? 
3. How do I calm myself if i were to feel anxious if i go to Brazil?

I'm also very hesistant to go to the NHS about it because I went before and I didnt feel comfortable opening up to the people i was given and just have sortve given up on that option. But is it worth a try? I'm scared to think ill be judged by my gp or my work might find out and treat me differently or i might not have time to go for visits.

My parents be with me until I was asleep. Most times I would wake up, asking them to come back and never leave me. When I grew older I got depressed and also suicidal. It was finally nice coming to terms with it and actually wish for it to just end. Then I get better and I feel just like when I was younger. Now I'm constantly thrown between the two states of mind.

409,mentalhealth,1,"Weird symptoms and I'm not sure where to place them! Heyo! I would love some help placing these symptoms, I've been trying to find information online but I can drive myself crazy with that stuff, and thought it would be best to reach out to you wonderful people and see if anyone has any opinions on what this could be and if I should worry.

So I have anxiety, ADHD, and depression. Zoning out is something that I have delt with in the past. However more recently I've had these episodes which I have called dissociative episodes. I feel like my consciousness is being sucked into the back of my head, and often times I find the edges of my vision starting to turn black and I end up closing my eyes and my eyelids flutter, and then the feeling subsides and I start to sort of ""come forward"" again and I am left with a tingling sensation in the back of my head. I have three distinct memories of this happening, once at a grocery store last year where I still walked around and kind of was on autopilot and then came back to and I was a few aisles over and had filled my cart with stuff I needed to get. The second was when I was seeing a musical, and I remembered part of what was happening and started to lose the plot a little bit, and found myself still watching the show and listening to the music but feeling like my consciousness was being pushed back until I did the weird fluttery thing and came right back. I have flashes of the scenes and songs, but I really lost the plot (granted it seemed like most of the people around me did too.) I was probably in that pushed back mental state for like 15 minutes or so. And the final example was like, 20 minutes ago? I kind of felt like I was being pushed back for like a few minutes (I didn't check how long but I know it wasn't long at all) and am just left with a fun tingly feeling in the back of my head.

More context time: I have done a lot of research on DID and I don't think it's that because I don't feel like I have really lost long periods of time or have any other distinct personalities (it's more like personality states, but I feel like everyone feels more macho in some situations and more delicate other times) but yeah, no amnesia and no trauma as a child. As far as if it's DP/DR or BPD that's for sure possible cuz I have a terrible sense of self and sometimes feel like I don't belong in my body. And it also could just be a bad brain dissociation thing. But I'm not a professional, and with my ADHD shit honestly I haven't had the time to really get into this with a professional. So I would love to hear what other people who know about mental health think. I'm still feeling not all here, but I also think it could be cuz I'm tired?

Anyway, thank you so much for taking the time to read my garbage, I would love to hear your theories and queries. All the best!

Update: It's been 24 hours and I'm sometimes still tingly and sometimes feel pressure in the back of my head.

410,mentalhealth,1,"Why is getting help so darn hard? This is my first time posting here so I'll try to make it short and simple. Since I was about 8, my mental health has been quite the rollercoaster. My first experience with psychosis was when I was 12. my friend from school had a sister who called the police to my house because they believed I was suicidal/violent, and they took me to the hospital. I was interrogated by a doctor and they told my parents everything. This only ended up making me get In trouble. The doctor asked my parents to take me back there and consider counselling, but like they would let that happen. They were mad and refused to believe that anything was wrong. I experienced trauma early on as a kid and a lot of my issues stem from that I'm sure. As a teenager nearing adulthood (grad) I've tried many times to find counselling, talking to my family, talking to friends, (mind you I don't talk much) and everything has absolutely done nothing. My school counselor told my parents everything like the doctor did, and that basically broke my trust. When I was suicidal I tried to seek out a councilor at a local youth space and they told me to wait 5 months for a 30 minute session. Is that reasonable? Sometimes I feel really stuck and hopeless. I have never gotten I diagnosis so it's really hard to explain anything I feel to people without them assuming I'm just an angsty teen. P.S, I don't have a family doctor either. I really really need to talk to someone who can help me.    What other options do I have?? Should I just stick it out until I can go to a professional clinic or seek therapy on my own?

411,mentalhealth,1,"Sometimes I worry I might accidentally kill someone. I've been a lot through my life, a lotta trauma mainly revolving around my shitshow family. My mom is psychotic, like legit psychotic. Sees stuff, hears stuff, delusional. Not in my life anymore, none of my family are- which is just.. Idk. I always check the news, look up their names on google- seeing if one of them died or killed another. Sounds crazy but TRUST ME it is NOT irrational to believe. They are really  that screwed up.

&amp;#x200B;

 With that being said, I know plenty of red flags, emotional patterns and general toxic traits/behaviors. I am a skittish person, will flinch if you make any sudden movements. Will raise my voice unintentionally, if you have a lot of energy. Though, I also have anger issues of my own. Unlike my mom or sister or really anyone I know with mental issues,  I don't get angry at others and blame them when I get angry. I don't start arguments, I don't call people names just because I'm miserable- I don't do anything other than hide, lay around depressed, or vent online. I am a closeted person, I don't like speaking out about my emotions and I'm damn good at hiding how I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

 No, when I say ""anger issues"", I  mean that in a defensive way. I may not lash out due to my anger, but I will with others. My emotional state is... Weird I guess. I don't feel human because of it, I have a lot of identity issues regarding how I view others and myself. I'm mostly content, emotionless but not monotone. Not happy, not unhappy. Calm and relaxed. But.. It can and will change, and there are no in-between when it does. I will not transition into one mood to the next, I literally go from one mood to the other. No warning signs. No nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

That isn't too bad and hardly noticeable. The only times it is is if I get suicidal or heavily depressed, or like I've mentioned- angry. Apply that to an argument and take into account the trauma and what I deal with- it is messy. I have a habit of physically lashing out on others because of things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not all arguments cause that. I can handle people being upset and restless, I can handle them yelling. I'll just get upset myself or be irritated and level-minded. It is when someone behaves in a way that reminds me of my family that set me off. I live with a roommate who possibly has bipolar disorder and he goes off on me over tiny things and has his hyper fixations on things that don't matter. This doesn't bother me, I mean.. It does but not to the point I lash out. He can call me names like he does, get all fussy, and I'll be somewhat calm during it all because I KNOW he's just being irrational. Yet, if his voice is monotone (emotionless) and he is in one of those moods- that is when I start freaking the fuck around and getting violent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only because those moments he gets like that are meaningless and absurd, but also because  my mom used to get like that too. I don't exactly know how to describe what I'm talking about- you know how insane people don't know right from wrong or is not in the bright mind? Like, they are not aware of the world around them and shit? Yeah??? sort like that I guess????? That mood where they blow a tiny thing out of proportion and says things that make no sense but they are angry about- but their anger doesn't show itself in their voice because their voice is very matter=of-fact and emotionless and they are IMPOSSIBLE to reason with due to their unawareness and unstable mood. Ya feel? Probably not, but that's the best way to put it.

&amp;#x200B;

That is probably what gets me the most- that and other things that remind me of how my mom would act when unstable. There is no moment where I realize this, it all happens so fast and I almost have no control. A blink of an eye. I'd either through what's in my hands or hit you in desperation. Again, this is due what THEY are doing/saying. One time I threw a fork at my roommate because he was insulting me in one of his fits and I was calm yet irritated until he made an insensitive comment regarding my mom. That is when I started screaming at him and just broke down there and then, first throwing the fork at him. I also have a habit of running off, like I left the house soon after with plans of never returning. It's really impulsive behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

I fear I might one day kill someone because of my unpredictable behavior and actions. This week alone I slit my wrists, hurt my knuckles from punching the wall, and had plans of running away. Not because of arguments either. I havent been in one recently, this is all due to being suicidal and depressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

What if I end up stabbing someone or killing someone? I get homicidal thoughts but never act on them ofcourse. What if something happens and I snap? I feel guilt, but a lot of times I won't feel it. A lot of times my empathy and guilt turn off for some reason, and I do things I really shouldn't. Idk... Sorry if this is kinda all over the place and repetitive, just venting really...

412,mentalhealth,1,"Possibly bipolar 2??? Help me. I've started seeing a psychologist for the first time in five years since I tried committing suicide. These past two years I've noticed a huge change in my mood, especially the past six months but it's always came in waves within the past 10 years. I've had health issues where I've had heart palpitations, vommitting, my reproductive system has been really unstable and I've had weird out of body experinces and feel like I'm going to freak out in the middle of a crowd (I forget who I am or where I am).

 I go through phases where I've been getting so aggitated over the smallest things, take everything personally or get defensive, have a attitude or short temper with strangers, co-workers or friends. I never get abusive though. Example, if I notice my roommates energy is off I instantly think it's time to move out because I've done something wrong. I've even deleted social media to get away from everyone and have a break. Sometimes it leads to a panic attack and me crying in the bathroom, freaking out thinking my life is over and the only solution is to kill myself. My concentration and memory has been shocking lately, to the point where I've left keys in my work door which could lead to a robbery. But I don't remember where I've left my keys at all until they're handed in. 

Then there are days where I wake up feeling fucking amazing, I'm ready to go to work in the best mood and smash out my tasks for the day. I'm feeling motivated, super focuses, inspired, creative and being the best and most beautiful person to be around! I'm more talkative, interactive, sometimes I'm super passionate about subjects and can talk very loudly or fast. Customers at work often ask me what I've said or to repeat it. I've even had customers ask me if I'm on meth because of my high energy. Something that usually would aggitate me, doesn't and I go about it in a positive way or... sometimes it triggers me to go back into a depressive state for the rest of the day or a few days. 

My mind feels like it's going in circles more quickly and these moods are becoming worse or more frequent. Does anybody else experince this?

413,mentalhealth,1,"I hate anxiety more than I hate myself... I guess its positive? I had a realization today and it really hit me hard...

This may sound narcissistic a little and I feel a bit bad for thinking this... but I’ve always felt like I was the most generous person I know. Because I always put the feelings of others before my own and I feel like I do a lot of sacrifices for others, sometimes really hard sacrifices. Not that I feel entitled to my friends generosity... but at times I feel like I give a lot more than I get back. But today I realized... that a lot of the ‘’sacrifices’’ I make includes me erasing myself, making myself as small as possible, suppressing my feelings so that others are happy... Because deep down, I feel like a nuisance to others... so making myself small and not complaining is a way to make their life better... at my mental health expense...

The sacrifices I thought I made, were things like : not saying how I truly felt, not saying my opinion if it goes against someone’s opinion, not complaining when someone hurts me, not setting boundaries, letting people step all over me without complaining... and very often I’m really hurt but I say nothing... I smile and tough it out... part of this is cause by self hatred, but most of it comes from my severe social anxiety... I live with roommates, and I hide in my room a lot because I fear their judgement for minor things. I don’t like doing chores in their presence, because my mind is telling me they are judging me for not doing enough, I don’t feel comfortable outside of my room, because I get tense when in their presence. They aren’t mean, but I saw them blow up once, and I am terrified of people raising their voices at me due to past experiences. I litteraly freeze and all I can think about is « how to get out of here/what do I say to calm things down so I can flee »...

A recent example of something I still feel a bit angry about: This Christmas, my boyfriend of three years received 2 luxurious tickets to see hockey. My bf could not decide whether he wanted to go with me or his friends. It was a once in a lifetime experience, because we would never pay to get tickets like those. He obviously wanted to go with me, but I could tell he only wanted to go with me because of boyfriend-girlfriend obligations, and that he’d rather go with his friend... He could not take the decision on his own and kept asking me even when I straight up told him that I am not the one who should be deciding since it’s HIS gift. But he kept turning things around so I’d be the one choosing... The match was yesterday, and of course he went with his friend. Because I told him so... Truth is... I really wanted to go. I never had the chance to see a live match... but I told him to go with his friend because I knew that was what would make him happier... The person who gave him the tickets was actually surprised I wasn’t with him since he did have him the tickets in front of me, he just never specified if it was a gift for the both of us or just to my bf... but, aside from the people who will read this post, no one will ever know how I truly over this... Its not the first time I’ve done something like this... and it probably won’t be the last... And there are days where I slap myself on the wrists for being jealous of my own generosity...

414,mentalhealth,1,"As an adult, how much of your life do you share with your parents? As in, how much do you let them know what's going on with you? 

My mom is sort of nosy and can be overprotective at times. She always needs to know everything &amp; gets upset if I hide things from her, or if she finds out something from someone else before I get a chance to tell her myself. She's always like ""I'm your mother, you have to talk to me"" so it makes me feel a little guilty but it also feels very controlling. 

It doesn't help that I still live with them (please keep the ""you gotta move out"" comments to yourself, thanks). They probably feel entitled to know every step that I make. They still have authority over me, in a way. But think about it, even as a teenager, how much did you share with them? I feel like I've never had healthy boundaries when it came to sharing. My mom would even read my journals when I was a kid and that fucked me up.

Things like that made it quite difficult for me to make choices on my own because I always feel like I ""should"" talk to my parents first or else I'm gonna get reprimanded.

I even got to the point of bringing my own lunch so I don’t even have the chance of interacting with lunch ladies anymore.
I’m just tired and I didn’t realized how much I cope just by not going to school til I missed the whole month of December and instead of think “oh maybe there is something going on, we should take this seriously” they just sent a letter that said if I missed every one more day of school they will call the state or something

416,mentalhealth,1,"My dog knew? Hi, Im new to making posts, so please bare with me. 
I’m Em, I suffer with trauma induced anxiety and depression. Earlier today I had a panic attack and it was quite bad. I haven’t had one like that in a while. I was in my room when it happened (I live in the loft) and my dog was downstairs in the living room. Apparently he was whining and the door and doing little barks, so my sister knew something was wrong. She opened the door so he could come upstairs and he starts going frantic at my ladders, alerting my sister what was going on. He’s not a loud dog, he rarely ever barks, but he is going absolutely ballistic at this point, I’ve never heard him like that. He tries jumping up my ladders to get to me but can’t because my sister is sat on them, which seems to worry him even more. He then proceeded to get a flannel from the bathroom and bring it downstairs so my mum notices, he’s a very naughty dog so she noticed straight away. Normally he’s a bugger for dropping stuff, but he did as he was told, at that point my mum knew something was going on. She closed him in the living room and came upstairs. A little while later as I’m calming down I ask if he can come up, I wanted to see what he would do. Bronn is a very very energetic dog, he’s a young border collie, so he leaps on my mums bed as usual but he seems frantic. He climbed all over me, circled me, and finally laid down with his head smushed against my leg.

I'm a 20yo female and have borderline personality disorder, severe depression/anxiety and slight schizophrenia, which means i used to hear voices telling me to hurt myself. That's controlled now. In fact, a lot of it was controlled. I felt better. For months, I felt recovered. No more crisis, no more wanting to die, no more cutting. I reconnected with friends, got a well paying job, a boyfriend, got my grades up. Hell, i won a highly competitive college contest to represent my school at Washington DC (im from brazil, so thats gigantic). 

And now? I feel like everything is fucking crashing around me. My friends all think I'm cured and see me as this beacon of hope for their own problems, and i cant let them down. I hate my job. I feel like my boyfriend is distant and doesn't really care. My grades aren't worth shit if i don't learn a thing, and this Washington competition thing is so out of my league it's laughable. I'll never do good in it. I never truly do good at anything.

I don't know what to do. I've already taken my meds for calming down but i still want to grab a knife at the kitchen and go to town. Maybe this time will be the one i actually have the guts to do it. I used to think like that when i was at my worst, and tonight feels like those days.

I've been sick since i was 9. I'm so tired of therapy, of meds, of living like this. I'm so tired, and yet going to sleep will just make tomorrow come faster. I don't want to live anymore.

I don't want to live, and the only thing keeping me here is my family. Rn i wish id get sick, really sick. That way, they would get some time to accept I'm going to die. It wouldn't be so abrupt for them. Maybe theyd forget faster.

420,mentalhealth,1,"Derealization Hello! I guess I just had a question. But here's some backstory. 

I literally do not feel real. I feel as if I'm like, in a big machine looking though my eyes or something and I'm watching things happen to me in life. But I don't FEEL it.
I remember a few years ago I could feel the situations or the places I was in... if that's how you say that. Like i felt like i was there. But i dont now.

I'm almost sure that 2 experiences I've had in the past year have given me this problem. One of them is when I almost drowned in Yosemite while white water rafting a class 5 river. It was a very very traumatic experience as I got caught under the raft after it flipped over for a bit. This happened in June 2019.
The other experience was when I accidentally smoked laced weed at a friends house and had a really bad trip. I specifically remember worrying that what I was living and my entire life wasn't real while under the influence. Because I didn't know what was happening to me I was very scared which made the trip even worse. This happened in September 2019.

I guess what I'm asking is, does anyone else have this problem? And is there a way I can feel normal again? I really really just want things to feel like they used to but I don't know how. It's very frustrating and depressing. 

Thanks.",derealization hello guess just question s backstory literally feel real feel m like big machine looking eye m watching thing happen life don t feel remember year ago feel situation place s say like felt like dont m sure experience past year given problem drowned yosemite white water rafting class river traumatic experience got caught raft flipped bit happened june experience accidentally smoked laced weed friend house really bad trip specifically remember worrying living entire life wasn t real influence didn t know happening scared trip worse happened september guess m asking doe problem way feel normal really really just want thing feel like used don t know s frustrating depressing thanks
421,mentalhealth,1,"I had a serious anxiety attack last night and I've called in sick at work. I was diagnosed with GAD last year, I know I've always had an anxiety problem, but since starting this new job my anxiety has been the worst, but I also don't want to make out that my work only seems bad from my anxiety. 

I've been going through the NHS SilverCloud CBT course, and despite me getting better with social life, house work, general things, my current job is something I really can't get over. I've been having many sleepless nights because my anxiety is so bad, I've also been becoming very depressed at this job. To explain what my job is like, I work in a call center for a recycling company, and it's the most stressful job I've ever had. Firstly the role was made more attractive to me before I started, they said in the interview it's not a sales role and won't be like working in a call center, then I start and it is indeed a sales role and the only difference it has from other call centers is that you're not timed when going the loo, however I find I can never go in the first place. The benefits are gob shite, I'm only allowed 10 days of annual leave, no sick pay and long working hours. I'm 3 weeks in and still constantly needing to ask for help, the managers are always busy, the work load is far too high, the phone never stops ringing and emails never stop coming in, a quiet day is still really stressful. No one seems to like me there, I get eyes rolled at me, I get laughed at like when I was back in school, I feel genuinely very out of place (never done a call center job so I don't get into the flow of it), and last night was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. 

I was sweating like mad, my heart felt like it would actually pound out of my chest, I felt like I was going to actually be sick, I was having weird hallucination like dreams where I was having weird dreams but I was fully awake making me feel even worse, I was shaking, I felt like I was going to die at some points. This went on from midnight till five in the morning. I called in sick because not only am I sleep deprived, I actually feel dizzy and like I can't move my body. My anxiety was that strong that I took propranolol and it didn't make any difference, I kept trying to focus on my breathing, but absolutely nothing worked. There was no way I was going to deal with a stressful day at work today.

I hate my current situation so much, I have to do this job to pay rent, but I feel like I can't do it anymore, I really do. I feel sick or depressed constantly. It's only a matter if time till they fire me now, I've been ill a lot now (I had a bad cold the start of this month so I was off for 4 days), and I had a day off from stress before that), they've already told me they only allow their staff 5 sick days a year, I've already gone over that. 

I've tired to go to hr about my stress, but they keep being like ""you'll be ok, you'll get over this, it's stressful for everyone"".

422,mentalhealth,1,"What is this? I hate being like this. A little backstory: my husband had an affair 2 years ago, it emotionally broke me. We separated for 6 months and decided to try things again. 
So far he hasn’t done anything in the past 2 years to lead me to believe he is cheating again. 

But, I have some many doubts, trust issues, anxiety, insecurities and a feeling of hopelessness. 

I feel the need to go through his phone all the time, I hate when he talk to other females even if they are just friends.  He hasn’t done anything to make me believe he is having an affair. But sometimes I feel like my anxiety makes me see things, like him being sketchy with his phone, is he really being sneaky or is my anxiety making me see it that way? 

Sometimes I want him to cheat again to justify my feelings and prove that I was right about feeling this way.  How can I trust again? How can I cope with this anxiety and insecurities?

424,mentalhealth,1,"I had a breakdown today... Please don't judge me. I just need to vent in a safe place. 

Today I broke down because my brain can't regulate the chemicals that establish emotions. I broke because my insurance is complete shit...

Thursday I went, with a new written prescription, to my pharmacy to get the Zoloft I've taken for three years. I had three ninety day refills from a different doctor. I was on my last two weeks and asked my new doctor for a script. Got the script, but waited (because I knew my insurance wouldn't fill it until I was closer to being out) until I had two pills left. The pharmacy closes early because the one pharmacist on duty had somewhere to go. No call from them. Friday there was a terrible ice storm and I couldn't leave my house. So yesterday (Saturday) I call to see if I can pick it up. They're busy and say I should have gotten a text. I didn't, can they just check quickly? Nope they'll call back. Never got a call, I didn't call them because I got extremely busy. 

Then today I go up there to see what the heck is going on. They didn't fill it. Why? My insurance isn't going to pay for the fill until the 25th. Why? It's too early for a refill. Wtf?? I can't call my insurance. They're closed on the weekends. They don't have a 24hour line. Why? Because they are the worst. I've had so many problems with them. 

I ask the pharmacist why I didn't get a call. They say I should have gotten a text from the automated system. I don't like that answer. I start to feel upset. I ask the pharmacist if there's anything they can do. I need the script. It's literally the only thing that keeps me feeling okay. It's not my fault. It's my brain. My brain can't regulate itself correctly. I feel like a druggie. I tell her, ""please I can't wait that long I need it ..."" She tells me I'll have to pay for it, ""I don't care"" she asks me if I'm sure and repeats that my insurance probably won't refund me. I'm tearing up and ask how long it'll take to refill. They close for lunch in ten minutes and it probably won't be ready for two hours. I start crying. Like fucking ugly crying. 

I begin to feel that familiar fight or flight shakiness. I pull out of the drive through and to the side. I start to cry. I can't stop. I call my husband. He can't do anything. I ask him to try to get someone on the phone. He gets off. He tries. He texts me that all he's getting is an automatic system. I just can't believe how unlucky I feel. 

I drive home trying to control my tears. I scream. I get home and just weep to my husband. I apologize for crying. For not being able to handle my emotions without a pill. I cry trying to calm myself. I usually don't like to have someone try to help me. I don't like being touched or held when crying. I was sitting on the ground next to the bed my husband was sitting on. I tried to get up (I'm six months pregnant and it's so hard) but couldn't. My husband jumped up to help me onto the bed. He held me and rubbed my back.

426,mentalhealth,1,"Does this happen to anyone else? I don’t know how to explain what happened to me tonight but it didn’t feel great at all. I grew up with parents that didn’t believe in mental health disorders, and that you can control your mental health any time with your own mind.
So, I have never been to therapy and I really feel like I should go. The only time I’ve ever felt the way I’m about to describe was at certain points in a past relationship, my ex girlfriend used to break up with me frequently and it would cause me to panic, I would get a really tight feeling in my chest, and stop being able to talk or function if I thought it was going to happen. I would be overridden with anxiety, and not be able to calm down. I would sometimes dissociate and I feel like that’s what happened to me tonight, but I was feeling the anxiety/panic attack feeling at the same time. 

So, I have some mutual friends of some of my very closest friends that are really cool. They’re serious musicians and will likely be playing shows this year and they’ve both been in locally successful bands in the past. I myself am also a musician and have been for several years, I’m a song writer and I like almost every type of music. I really like the music they want to play, which is faster punk rock. We finally got around to playing together tonight and while trying to figure out what to play over what the drummer was playing, I had a huge mental breakdown/began dissociating and couldn’t create anything on the spot or play music with them, it was like my brain wouldn’t let me. I felt like I didn’t have access to my own thoughts. I choked. I feel so horrible, I feel like I wasted their time and I’m scared they’ll be judgmental of me and think that I’m a fraud/not have a good opinion of me going forward. We stopped, got beers next door from a record store that we were using to play in after hours, and tried going back in and playing again after and I just couldn’t do it. I felt better at that point to where I could at least talk to them about how I was feeling and explain what was going but I hate that I couldn’t come up with anything on the spot or play anything for them. Even if they don’t want me in their band I would still like to be friends with them but I’m terrified that watching me have a mental breakdown will change their opinion of me

428,mentalhealth,1,"Extremely bad social anxiety. How to cope? Hi, I'm a 19M college student. I've always had problems interacting with people in person, whether it is talking, body language, eye contact, or the like. Now I've never been a social person; even in my childhood, I was known for just wanting to have some time alone. This, in turn, has manifested into a life of reclusiveness, loneliness, depression, and extreme social anxiety. I've never had it in me to ask for help because I felt I would be cast aside by those around me, just as I was in my preteen and early teen years. But, today, I've decided it's time to break the silence.

I figured the best way to start my journey of self-improvement was to confront my social anxiety, which has been severely hindering, no, denying my ability to build any kind of relationship with anyone. And I feel that if I can start to build relationships, that gives me a good platform to mitigate other problems, i.e. depression.

So here's how things line up: 

a) I never have it in me to initiate a conversation.

b) When conversation does happen, I'm super awkward. Like, slurring speech, hands in pockets, no eye contact, weird responses that aren't exactly relevant to conversation. Note that none of this happens when I am alone or talking online.

c) When I get asked to hang out, things are fine for a while, until suddenly my brain keeps telling me ""get outta there."" Usually results in me leaving early.

d) Barely any friends outside of online circles.

So I'm looking for any suggestions to help with this. Sorry for the long post, and I thank you for reading to the end.

429,mentalhealth,1,"Struggling to Sleep Alone I'm looking for advice on how to be able to cope with sleeping alone. 

Currently I have a boyfriend and we sleep together at least five nights a week, sometimes with me going over purely to sleep at his place. 

For some background info, I had lived with boyfriends (lived with one from 2014-2016 and the other from 2016-2019) for nearly five years straight with only living alone for about two months out of that time. Those two months were spent with me casually dating someone and sleeping at their house a several nights a week. I'm not used to sleeping alone. My current relationship started immediately after my old one (I was still living with my ex too) and we have been sleeping together the five plus nights per week since we started dating. The longest we have consecutively slept apart has been three nights.  

The nights where I sleep alone in my own apartment are miserable. Whenever it's time to get in bed, I start crying and get filled with dread. I feel physically sick, my chest is heavy and I get intense nausea. I'm in tears most of the time until I fall asleep. It makes me miss my partner so strongly, I often go out of my way to be at his place so I don't have to sleep alone. I am also get nightmares more frequently when sleeping alone and wake up frequently. I don't feel well rested when I have to get up the next day. When I really can't fall asleep, sometimes I will get back out of bed and go watch tv until I calm down and then try again. This usually makes it to where I fall asleep faster and have less issue but I still cry. 

Interestingly, I don't experience this if I choose to take a mid afternoon nap, maybe because I am exhausted if I am doing that?

When I sleep with my partner I fall asleep faster, have fewer nightmares, I don't wake up in the night and I generally feel better rested in the morning. He doesn't even have to be sleeping at the time, sometimes he'll stay up working or playing games in the same room and I sleep just fine. 

I want to be okay with sleeping alone. I hate that I feel this way. My partner is alright with me coming over every night to sleep over, he says that he enjoys having me over to sleep. I don't want to because in a few months we are planning to date long distance for about four months so I need to be okay with sleeping alone to make that work. The reason for that is that we are both in college and he graduates one semester ahead of me, the plan is for us to move in together after I graduate. 

Due to my sleep issue it has led to some questionable decisions on my end. Above I referenced how I lived with two different boyfriends in the same year - the second one I only knew three weeks before asking him to move in. He sold a bunch of his things and subleased his apartment to come move in - he was sleeping over every night and we decided ""Fuck it, just move in with me?"". 

I haven't talked to my partner about this. I don't want to pressure him or make him feel guilty for not sleeping with me every night, especially when we try the long distance. I want to be okay with sleeping alone, especially since it's healthier to be able to cope. Plus, this happens whenever one of us are out of town and can't sleep together so it's an inevitable issue even if we live together. 

Maybe another reason playing into how upset I feel is that he hardly ever comes over to sleep at my place. I take it personally that he'd rather stay at his place and sleep without me than drive the 15 minutes to come stay with me. I go out of my way consistently to stay with him. I have a busier schedule than him. For convenience, sometimes I won't go to my home for several days straight but it's frustrating since I feel like I'm paying rent just to store my shit... but I think that's a whole other post. 

Also, if it helps I have diagnosed Bipolar Disorder, a specific phobia (unrelated to sleep) and CPTSD. I am currently taking Lamictal 150mg but am about to transition into taking Lamictal 100mg + 5mg Lexapro, just need to pick up my new prescription.

A little back story, I haven’t been the best girlfriend, I have mental issues and I’ve gotten help. I suffer from social anxiety and depression.

I used to think so negatively back then but now, everything is beautiful to me and I don’t have any hatred towards anybody now, not even myself. I love school and my job. I love life right now. It felt like everything was going great. 

My boyfriend (22 m) and I (20 F) have been together for 4 years. We got into an argument 2 days ago about something small and personal. It occurred an hour before he was about to pick me up for a party. I’ll admit, I was hard on him for this personal thing that we argued about but it wasn’t the first time I told him about it but he didn’t do anything to fix it in the past.

432,mentalhealth,1,"What is the best way to self diagnose? Hi, I've been struggling with what I believe might be depression or/and anxiety for some years now. There are periods when I feel fine, but it always came back and sometimes even worse than before. I want to seek out help but I won't be able to do that for at least 6 more months. But during that time, I would like to somehow prepare my parents and explain to them what I am going through so when the times come, they can help me overcome my fears and maybe help me find a good specialist or at least support me emotionally.

433,mentalhealth,1,"Seeking advice to motivate unemployed husband with bipolar My (33F) husband (38M) and I have been together for 12 years, living together for 8 years, married for a little over 6. He was diagnosed with bipolar in his early 20s and we open from the beginning about his mental health.

Everything was going well until about 2 years ago. Husband convinced himself that his medication wasn't doing anything and, without telling me or seeking medical advice, stopped taking his medication. I could tell within a short while that something was different (short tempered, very defensive, not sleeping) and, when I found out the reason why, encouraged him to resume taking medication and speak to a new psychiatrist about changing meds.

Husband started seeing the psychiatrist who believed that maybe there was a misdiagnosis all those years ago and kept husband off the lithium. To say things went to shit over the next 12 months is an understatement. Towards the end of it, we were constantly fighting: I couldn't say anything without it becoming an argument. Husband became emotionally abusive towards me, was yelling at his boss, swearing at his parents- everything was totally out of character. Because of his illness, he couldn't see how bad it was or how it was affecting those around him. I had a few suicidal thoughts and became depressed myself. Had I not been scared that he would harm himself or our dogs, I would have walked out.

It all came to a head when, 7 months ago, he had an appointment with a different psychiatrist for a second opinion. He showed up late, didn't like the questions being asked, and started yelling at the staff. The psychiatrist had him scheduled and the police came to the house later that night to have him involuntarily admitted to the local hospital. He was to stay there until he was deemed to be not a threat to himself or others.

Husband was resistant to the treatment at first but was swayed after 48 hours to have a blood test so they could prescribe meds. He was put back on lithium and, within days, we could see an improvement. He was in the public hospital for 2 weeks and then in a private hospital for 3. It sounds horrible, but I was relieved to not have him at home: I knew where he was, that he wasn't doing anything stupid, and felt like I could breathe again.

Just before being admitted to hospital, Husband resigned from his job. He has not worked since. He is applying for jobs, going for some interviews, but has not received a 'yes' yet. We have savings put aside, but had other plans for that money. I wouldn't mind so much about the not working, but he's not doing anything at home. He has no motivation to do anything and sleeps most of the day.

Though we're not arguing, we barely talk. We haven't had sex in 7 months and I feel like we're room mates who share a bed, not husband and wife. I've tried talking to him about everything, but my attempts seem to fall on deaf ears, or things improve temporarily but revert to the way they've been.

I am at a loss about what to do. How can I encourage him to do more without coming off like a nag? His parents have tried talking to him wothout success. He is also seeing a psychologist but she hasn't been able to get through to him either.

I love my husband but every day I get more and more frustrated with his inaction.

445,mentalhealth,1,"vent // suicidal ideation tw hi, this is my first time posting on this forum but i just really need to vent and this is going to come off as very jumbled and inarticulate but i think i just need to get it off my chest. 

ever since i can remember, i've had more emotions than i know what to do with. when i get frustrated, my brain goes from zero to one hundred in a split second. i feel like i'm never in control of my emotions, rather that they're in control of me. no matter how minuscule the frustration is (spilling something on my shirt, getting on the wrong elevator, etc.) it often feels like it's the end of the world even when it isn't. something very minor that feels major will happen and before i can even do anything, my brain tells me that i should kill myself. i feel like my brain is lying to me all of the time. 

the frustrations become more and more of a problem when i'm around my parents/family and i'm not quite sure why this is. one of my theories is that i control my frustrations so much during the day that when i get home and/or around my immediate family, i kind of release all of the frustrations. i'm not sure if that's what the case is but that's one of my guesses. 

(this part is a little unrelated but somewhat related) sometimes i feel like a test subject. on whether or not my parents can raise a mentally unstable child. on whether or not someone with all of my issues can be successful. on whether or not someone as fucked as me has a chance at life. and i don't think the way my mother looks at me helps much - she looks at me like i'm some helpless fucking child and it's getting to the point where i hate being around her because she looks at me like that so much. sometimes i feel like i'm her test subject to prove that she can be a parent to someone like me, but i feel like the results would read: negative.

446,mentalhealth,1,"seeking help/opinions. i don't want to make this too long. please ask questions if it will help with responses &lt;3

i am a 19 year old girl who has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, BED, and PTSD. i currently see no psychiatrist or therapist: i am looking to change this ASAP as I am in fear of my life. my main trauma comes from various forms of abuse from my sister and dad up until around age 12-13. my mom has since been my rock and i live with her and her boyfriend. she has done everything in her power to help me, though sometimes she scolds me for my issues, i think it is due to frustration out of not knowing how to help me. some other noteworthy events are the divorce, sexual harassment when younger, dating way older guys when younger (daddy issues)/getting groomed, cheated on, manipulated. i have also struggled with my weight up and down since i was younger, which takes a toll on my mental health too. i definitely have attachment issues, if i am attached to someone i will try to kill myself or threaten to hurt myself if i feel they are not in love with me/try to leave me. i also overthink/worry a lot and deal with paranoia. i have been on and off meds, in and out of therapy, and used to go to psych wards for suicide attempts when younger...

i am just so tired of the cycle and hurting those around me. another thing that is pushing me to want to make this change is that i am now becoming abusive to someone i love, my boyfriend of 8 months. at first he had his own issues and was not so great, however now ALL he wishes to do is love and support me. all i do when i am like this, which is really often, i tell him he is lying about loving me, that he wants to hurt me, and i lie and tell him i don't love him and i used him, while none of this is true. i know im a piece of shit for this. i feel so much shame and guilt. i don't want to hurt him, and it is so much mental turmoil for us both, which is all my fault. it is sick. i am a kind, loving, and very sensitive person. i don't get mean to anyone else except him, and i feel so terrible for it. i want to stop. i want to love myself and in turn stop doing this to him. the issue is, when i get into these mindsets or convince myself everyone is out to hurt or get me, it gets very hard to switch out until i destroy something.

i am seeking some sort of guidance or suggestion. i am very unhappy with my weight right now, so medication scares me due to possible weight gain, which would make me MUCH more depressed. i also have always felt zombie like/i fear my brain will become addicted. overall, medication really scares me and if it is possible, i'd wish for it to be a last resort. i was wondering if trying and sticking to therapy again would help with this. the thing is, if it has never helped since i was younger, why would it now? (in terms of my impulsiveness/attachment issues). do i need to stress my desire to learn coping skills? is there a different approach i need to take? i am so lost. i really just want to fix everything. the other day i told my boyfriend i wanted to change, to get better--i really, really do, yet today i felt so low and scared that everyone hated me, i told him i was leaving, that i did not love him, and that i was going to find another guy. i am really disgusted...i just want to make it up to myself and the people around me. i need ways to cope, as that seems to be my biggest issue because it all spirals when i convince myself that i am useless or unwanted, etc. thank you.",seeking help opinion don t want make long ask question help response year old girl diagnosed depression anxiety bed ptsd currently psychiatrist therapist looking change asap fear life main trauma come various form abuse sister dad age mom rock live boyfriend power help scold issue think frustration knowing help noteworthy event divorce sexual harassment younger dating way older guy younger daddy issue getting groomed cheated manipulated struggled weight younger take toll definitely attachment issue attached try kill threaten hurt feel love try leave overthink worry lot deal paranoia med therapy used psych ward suicide attempt younger just tired cycle hurting thing pushing want make change abusive love boyfriend month issue great wish love support like really tell lying loving want hurt lie tell don t love used true know im piece shit feel shame guilt don t want hurt turmoil fault sick kind loving sensitive person don t mean feel terrible want stop want love turn stop doing issue mindset convince hurt get hard switch destroy seeking sort guidance suggestion unhappy weight right medication scare possible weight gain make depressed felt zombie like fear brain addicted overall medication really scare possible d wish resort wondering trying sticking therapy help thing helped younger term impulsiveness attachment issue need stress desire learn coping skill different approach need lost really just want fix day told boyfriend wanted change better really really today felt low scared hated told leaving did love going guy really disgusted just want make people need way cope biggest issue spiral convince useless unwanted thank

452,mentalhealth,1,"Reminder: There is more to bulimia than self-induced vomiting Bulimia nervosa is almost a sort of mix of anorexia nervosa and binge-eating disorder. However, it distinguishes itself from these and other eating disorders through regular periods of binging (eating an excessive amount of food in a short period of time) and purging (trying to avoid gaining weight from the food through various methods)

Eating disorders are often pushed aside when it comes to mental health, and it's a shame because many people go without knowing that they have a problem. Many people view bulimia as eating a lot and then purging by puking which, yes, is one of the more common and dangerous forms of bulimia, but is not the only one.

There are two types of bulimia. Purging type includes self-induced vomiting, but can also be an abuse of laxatives or other medications of this type.

Exercise and fasting in itself are not harmful, but it is when it's used for the exclusive purpose of not gaining weight after a binging episode. These methods can easily become self destructive if used for the wrong reasons.

453,mentalhealth,1,"Am I brave making this decision or am I just running away? I apologise for the long post but in order for you to see why I feel like I need to leave I need to explain how I’ve found myself making one of the hardest choices of my life.  I also apologise for the grammar but it’s been a long emotional day and I really hope this is coherent. 

Today I have admitted something to myself that I’ve been in denial about for fourteen years. I am an addict. 

I’m a 27 year old man who grew up in a town just outside of London. My mother is addicted to prescription pills like Xanax and Valiums and also smokes about an eighth of weed a day and has done for as long as I remember. She’s mentally ill herself and loves me with all of her heart and just wants me to be happy. My father was a depressed alcoholic who spent the last ten years of his life slowly drinking himself to death after a car accident and died when I was 19. 

I grew up on an estate and have been friends with the same people for all of my life. They have always felt like my chosen family even before we started partying. We used to run around the estate causing havoc together, we got in fights with other people and each other, we laughed and we cried together. Went through trauma together. We saw all sorts of people come and go but there was always a core group of us that were as thick as thieves, so much so people to this day still talk about how envious they are about how close we still are after so long. 

We didn’t stay boys forever though and soon drink and drugs came on to the scene. At 14 a few of us had already left school and were in the park drinking and smoking weed like a lot of teenagers do but before long outside influences led us to other avenues of taking the edge off on a Friday and by 16 we were already taking ecstasy and getting into underground raves in London. By 18 we were in the pub every weekend with a pint in hand and a wrap of coke in the our pockets thinking we were living our best lives. 

When my dad died at 19 my childhood dog had died an hour before and I couldn’t understand why life had been so merciless in such a short space of time and so I began to question everything I thought I knew. Was this the point of it all? Do we just live this way and then die? What’s right and what’s wrong? I started reading books by people like Emma Goldman and Noam Chomsky and I came to realise that the world isn’t actually quite right and so began the wanting of something more but what that something was I had no idea which created an emptiness that my friends couldn’t understand. To them all I was feeling was just words. 

The older we got the more we went through. Nothing too special, few heart breaks here and there, good times and bad times just like everyone else but the drinking and drug taking had gotten heavier. I couldn’t see it at the time but I’d become so used to getting out of it to escape reality that I’d actually become addicted to it.  I realise now I didn’t want it but needed it. By 23 I began smoking joints like they were cigarettes, pub on Friday, Rave on Saturday and smoke weed while you’re on a come down all day Sunday kind of thing. I knew it wasn’t normal but we were having fun and weren’t hurting anybody and I dismissed my fears of addiction as just a come down making feel terrible. 
At 25 I’d overdosed on some bad ketamine after being a bit reckless after a recent love interest had ended things and I ended up needing to be resuscitated on site at a festival. I still remember hearing people speak but seeing only black, until I felt a sharp sting on my leg where I came back around like I’d just risen from the dead. I had a cup of tea and went back to my friends before double dropping two ecstasy tablets my friend sold me. 
As my close friends all grew stronger with their partners we saw each other maybe once a week where once it would be more or less everyday. I became distant and spent more time on my own. Getting lost in my own head searching for something I still couldn’t find, making me feel emptier inside but then in June last year I met, who I’m going to call for anonymity purposes, D. 
I’d been in relationships before but never like this. We fell in love hard and quick. She was the sister of a friend so we kind of felt safe with each other as it was like an unofficial insurance policy that kept us both honest. 
The summer was perfect and for the first time in a long time I was hardly doing any drugs at all. I was still smoking a fair bit of weed but I was very keen on kicking it if not for me then for D.  But then D got pregnant.  Our own fault. We weren’t careful. It took us a week to decide what to do and at one point we were going to keep it until eventually we decided we needed to be us a little more first.  We went to the clinic and got the pill, and then I held her for hours as she lay on my bathroom floor bleeding, being sick, shivering and sweating at the same time, helplessly just holding her. Afterwards we both agreed that we made the right choice and we were glad we did it together. 
But then things took a turn. D had to move for work and we saw each other less but we were still making it work. I had doubts but she would constantly reassure me and make me feel like there was nothing to worry about. Talking of weddings and how I’m her world in November and how she needs to be alone December, a week after I moved back in with my mother to get rid of any overheads so I could start a business, a move I definitely wouldn’t have done if I knew I was going to be broken up with due the easy availability of drugs in the house. I was complete crushed. I know relationships end all the time but I couldn’t understand why she reassured me when she was just going to leave. How was I supposed to trust anybody else when she was as convincing as she was? Something I’m sure many of you will have gone through. Naturally I was filled with grief as all of this love in me suddenly had no place to go. My world had never seemed smaller and I spent weeks in bed going out only to drink and sniff coke until 5 in the morning before coming home, taking some Xanax to fight the comedown while I smoked weed and went in and out of conciseness right through to Christmas and my birthday, where I began to hit my bottom and everything began to change. 

I was outside a bar on my birthday with a friend smoking a cigarette when he said that D was walking toward us. I didn’t believe him because I didn’t know she was in town but low and behold there she was.  She looked at me and turned away, walking and pretending that we hadn’t just locked eyes. I could barely breath. I needed a drink and another boot of coke but as I went back inside a bouncer stopped me and searched me, pulling out a joint id left on the inside pocket of my jacket that I’d forgotten about. We argued and he threatened to call the police over one joint and I laughed at him and told him to do it and as I did, British transport police pulled up at the traffic lights outside and the bouncer waved them over, where they proceeded to arrest me for the weed and the wrap of coke I’d forgotten to disclose on account of being a drunken mess. It was my birthday after all which the police were more than kind enough to arrange a stay 25 miles away from where I live only to leave me there for another part of the police to deal with. I broke down in my cell and I cried. Cried for D waking away. I cried for being in a cell on my birthday while I was still rushing off coke. The station nurse came to see me and declared me a severe concern or something of the like. I was later released where the custody sergeant apologised to me as I should have been dealt with on the road there and then and been dealt a caution. Thankfully he offered two officers overtime pay to drive me the 25 miles home as it was 5 in the morning and I didn’t have any money. I got into bed and stayed there right the way through new year and the first few days of January where my dog (the one to replace my childhood dog) had died of advanced liver cancer.

I gave up.  I couldn’t see which way I needed to go anymore so stayed in bed alone but for weed, tramadols and Valium’s. Until Friday where I decided to put up a facebooks status essentially seeking attention and making out like I was going to commit suicide but in reality what I was saying was that an old me has to die for a new me to be reborn but I didn’t correct people who were wrong because I enjoyed the attention. 

My mum would come in a few times a day each time with some more weed and pills because all she wanted to do was see her boy smile and this seemed to be the only way to get close. 
My friends pulled me out of bed yesterday afternoon where we drank and then sniffed coke until 6 in the morning before I walked home, slowly pondering everything that had gone over the last month and then when I got home and started looking back at the last year, then the last five before finally I started looking at my whole life before coming to the conclusion that I was, as Russel Brand puts it,  “a little bit fucked” 

I realised that I actually want to be sad because I want to get high and escape. When D left of course her absence hurt but that wasn’t the real problem. The real problem was I wanted her to save me. To save me from becoming what I was well on the way to becoming, my father. 

Every time I feel like maybe my life is going in the right direction I end up in a place I never even knew could feel this bad, so I turn to escape reality in an environment where drugs and drink are everywhere I turn. I can escape reality but not the means to get away from it. 
When I looked back at my life, I genuinely couldn’t remember the last time I was completely clean.  Alcohol, weed, cocaine, ecstasy, MDMA, DMT, shrooms, Xanax, valiums, tramadols, diazepams, two overdoses, countless blackouts, nights where I’ve lost everything and made mistakes that have sent shockwaves reverberating through out my life. 

I’ve never been suicidal. Not truly. I get very reckless and flirt with things that seem risky and generate a sort of romantic perspective of death because the closer I feel to it the more I feel something, anything to make me feel more alive. 
Over the last two decades or so I’ve been blessed with what some people go there whole lives without having but I have become desperately unhappy in my life right now and feel trapped. I’m terrified a great deal of the time. Terrified of being my dad or worse. It consumes me and starts to affect people around me. At home my mum wants be to be happy but she doesn’t know how to make it happen so she does what she can but it makes it worse. My friends are the same. They don’t understand that the life we live and our attitude towards drink and drugs isn’t normal and that it’s slowly destroying me. 

Which leads me to the point of this whole thing. I want to live a life sober, but I’m not strong enough to avoid the temptations that come hand in hand with the people I love most in this world. I have to either pick my mum and friends who’ve shaped me and been my family or I pick a new life that’s far away from any kind of life I’ve known before. 

So am I the asshole if I leave my friends and family in order to be clean and have a better chance of happiness in life? Or am I just being over the top and do I need to find a way to be clean and be around the people I love despite what comes with that? 


My brother supports me and tells me I need to get out of this place as soon as I can. My mother supports me even though she knows it means she might lose a son.  My friend says to I’m being over the top and I should try CBT something I’ve already tried. 

I’m going to the doctors first thing tomorrow but until then I guess I’m just after a strangers ear. Someone who doesn’t know me to tell me their perspective on it what I’m doing is brave or cowardly. 

If you’ve got down this far thank you so much for reading a little about my life so far, I hope you can help me going forward.",brave making decision just running away apologise long post order feel

455,mentalhealth,1,"No one gets it 20y female with a huge anxiety/fear around loved ones being involved accidents and traumatic deaths. To the degree where I feel like I need to kill myself first so that I don't have to watch other people suffer.  Unfortunately I express my fears in a wave of anger and frustration, and I often engage in self harm behaviours such as hitting my head and limbs. Whenever I tell anyone about my fears , I generally get one of two reactions : I either get told that I'm crazy for having so much anxiety and that I need to be in a pysch hospital or I just get told that people die every day and I just need to accept it. None of which is a great way to respond in my opinion. I know people die every minute of every day, but if something does happen I know that I will beat myself up over it and will blame myself like there's no tomorrow.  I also feel very anxious about leaving the house lately, on a good day I can get the bus by myself and feel relatively calm, on a bad day all it takes is me to walk to my local shop and I will feel the urge to cry because of how stressed I feel completing, what is for most, a mundane task. I consistently feel like I'm just repeatedly failing my therapist as every session seems to consist of the same phrases and conversations and I feel like I've failed drastically as someone with mental health issues, even though everyone says that recovery isn't linear. No-one understands why the aspect of death is so terrifying for me, and the fact that I have no control over people dying in traumatic accidents. I think people either simply don't care or can't be bothered to try and care. I feel like the phrase ""same shit different day"" is a good way of describing my anxiety  because my dad rides home from work on his bicycle most days and I feel like I can't begin to relax untill he's come in through the door because if I try and relax and he is injured in an accident then I'll have a go at myself because i'll feel like I could have somehow prepared myself by being upset already before the accident , so it wouldn't come as such a shock-In all honesty I think it's a waste of time where therapy is concerned, because it's not like having a fear of public speaking , where you gradually learn through each speech that speaking in public gets easier with every occasion, this is different because I can't predict when something bad will happen and my anxiety won't get better with time because I can't guarantee that every time I worry about an accident that it's not going to happen",get y female huge anxiety fear loved one involved accident traumatic death degree feel like need kill don t watch people suffer unfortunately express fear wave anger frustration engage self harm behaviour hitting head limb tell fear generally reaction told m crazy having anxiety need pysch hospital just told people die day just need accept great way respond opinion know people die minute day doe happen know beat blame like s tomorrow feel anxious leaving house lately good day bus feel relatively calm bad day take walk local shop feel urge stressed feel completing mundane task consistently feel like m just repeatedly failing therapist session consist phrase conversation feel like failed drastically issue say recovery isn t linear understands aspect death terrifying fact control people dying traumatic accident think people simply don t care t bothered try care feel like phrase shit different day good way describing anxiety dad ride home work bicycle day feel like t begin relax untill s come door try relax injured accident ll ll feel like prepared upset accident wouldn t come shock honesty think s waste time therapy concerned s like having fear public speaking gradually learn speech speaking public get easier occasion different t predict bad happen anxiety won t better time t guarantee time worry accident s going happen
456,mentalhealth,1,"Hi I'm new and I'm facing some difficulties in real life Hi as you read I'm new and am not really getting on well in real life. I would genuinely like to post some stories I made and stuff but I just want to get this all out of the way at first.

So its quite late well almost early just 5 minutes until tomorrow and I'm up crying and searching some pretty personal stuff up. But that's what this post is, sharing this information.   So I was searching some things about depression and anxiety, at the moment I'm crying because I have most of the symptoms but I dont think I have depression. By that I mean anytime I feel depressed or maybe feel like causing self harm I shout at myself for lying and acting like a fool as if I was pretending to have depression.  I'm assuming that this could be quite a bad way to react to these thoughts so I'm turning to you guys for help... 

I have some great friends and they have much more confidence than I do, they both are talking about coming out as they both feel as though they are homosexual. I won't share any personal information besides that and the fact that I feel comfortable around them... at the moment I'm considering that I could be trans. But my grandmother doesn't support trans people because she believes you should stay what you were born as. This of course makes me uncomfortable, one night I sat down with my family and talked about some things but I dont think they realized that I was hinting towards how I felt and i was very uncomfortable when my grandmother started talking about not exactly excepting trans people.

I haven't talked to my friends or family and am most certainly not considering professional help because of the fact that I am scared that maybe I'm just over exaggerating.   If you've reached this point, thank you for sticking through my story I'll be posting some better stuff when school is off for the weekend aka around four days.

459,mentalhealth,1,"“Bad” things keep happening to me and I don’t know how to get past them. (I just finished and this turned out longer than I expected, thank you if you if you take the time of reading me) 

I’m not sure if this is the right place to talk about this, sorry if it isn’t. The last couple of months I’ve been dealing with a bunch of things that have really taken a toll at my energy. 
I consider myself a lucky person and my friends joke that I’m Domino from deadpool (silly but is a cute reference). Lately I haven’t been feeling as lucky, in the last three months of 2019 I got into a car accident in the highway (construction site badly signed and at night) and literally nothing happened to me, just a stiff neck, my car had considerable damage but the insurance covered everything, this is an example of what I mean to have bad things happen to me but getting the best outcome out of them. In that same period of time my uncle went missing and was found 3 days later (he was the lucky one in this one, he is totally fine) and just last night someone tried to rob my car, that I’ve just gotten back from the shop, luckily(ha) because of this there weren’t any valuables inside, they tried to take the battery but they couldn’t. 
Friends and relatives keep saying that everything is fine, at least nothing worse happened in each case, that I’m safe and I get the sentiment but I’m so done with this stuff happening to me, I still get angry and scared, I’m scared to drive, to go outside too late or alone, I’m even scared to be in my apartment now and I don’t know what to do or why this kind of stuff keep happening to me. Should just accept that I’m like cursed? Or can I do anything to stop this kind of things from happening?  
I think the worst part is that for example I’m sure I got the trauma from my accident but since I didn’t have any physical injuries I had to deal with everything in silence, like I didn’t get the chance to recover mentally along an injury? Like I have to recover myself from all this things in silence and to keep going because I have other obligations and I just wish I could stop time and have a moment to heal myself or to even cry them out of my system and if I say something people keep telling me that it wasn’t a big deal because I’m fine physically but this things just keep eating me alive and I’m scared and far away from home and my parents and maybe all this things aren’t really that big of a deal anyways and I’m just being silly? 

What should I do?",bad thing happening don t know past just finished turned longer expected thank time reading m sure right place talk sorry isn t couple month dealing bunch thing really taken toll energy consider lucky person friend joke m domino deadpool silly cute reference lately haven t feeling lucky month got car accident highway construction site badly signed night literally happened just stiff neck car considerable damage insurance covered example mean bad thing happen getting best outcome period time uncle went missing day later lucky totally fine just night tried rob car just gotten shop luckily ha weren t valuable inside tried battery couldn t friend relative saying fine worse happened case m safe sentiment m stuff happening angry scared m scared drive outside late m scared apartment don t know kind stuff happening just accept m like cursed stop kind thing happening think worst example m sure got trauma accident didn t physical injury deal silence like didn t chance recover mentally injury like recover thing silence going obligation just wish stop time moment heal say people telling wasn t big deal m fine physically thing just eating alive m scared far away home parent maybe thing aren t really big deal anyways m just silly
460,mentalhealth,1,"Is this guy really crazy or just trying to get money out of me? 
So I've been talking to this guy for a month. He was ok but he did say he had a past with suicide and whatnot. I didn't really mind since I've had mentally ill people in my life before they were usually ok just talk about suicide. Suicide doesn't bother me. It's not my life not my concern. But like he said he had financial trouble had been homeless before and says stuff like that he doesn't like living. Ok so it got more intense after our second visit and I gave him 40 dollars last Sunday he told me a sad story on how he couldn't go to work. Then two days later he's having trouble with work and saying he can't pay rent. Well on Friday he's begging for 100 dollars to cover his rent. He goes on extreme after that. When we were hooking up I did notice that he does cut he has cuts on his thighs and wrists. He always said he struggles with mental health and eluded to having been depressed. So I can't tell if he's ill or just wants money?




Here's the whole dialogue of last night


Me: ""What are you up to?""


Him: ""Being sad and hungry ""

""Contemplating""


Me: ""Sorry about that you want anything at the store on Monday I could get you I'm going into town on Monday""


Him: ""Anything that doesn't require cooking utensils""


Me: ""Why?""


Him: ""Because I don't have any""


Me: ""What ones don't you have maybe I can get some. Yeah I'm pretty sure I can get you a cooking pan""


Him: ""Why bother? By next thursday afternoon I'll be homeless again. I haven't been able to find anything that will make me the money I need I  the time I need it""


Him again: ""It's taking all my self control to not take a warm bath with this razor right now, but I'm not ""supposed"" to do that and I know it makes me a piece of shit to even acknowledge that's what I want to do, but I  personally would have preferred M***** said anything like this before she commit suicide but she stayed silent like a ""good/kind"" person""


Me: ""Do you still need 100 dollars? I think I can get it if I get my laptop from UPS apparently it's waiting for me there. Just give me until Monday that's why I'm coming into town""


Me again: ""Oh you want to commit suicide? Over this? You know time will past and this will be behind you.""


Me again: ""You're not a piece of shit. You're a very good person. It would be terrible if you weren't here.""


Me: ""Hello are you there?""


Him:""You say ""over this"" as though it's nothing. Have you ever even experienced what ""this"" is like? Do you have any idea the arrogance and ignorance that comment contains? Do you have any idea what 27 years of having nothing in this world feels like? Of what being condemned to misery actually entails? Of being pressed to look up just to be met with a boot in your face every time? To come to know ""hope"" as a poisonous and toxic thing? So what if I do somehow manage to come up with next weeks rent. What about the one after that or after that. You want me to look forward to another 63 years on this earth without taking a moment to consider how exhausting that sounds to someone like me. How utterly unbearable that feels? 63 more years of having everything I dream of ripped to shreds. 63 more years of having all my efforts dismantled by a cold cruel world. 63 more years of torture. 63 more years of a desire less existence. You just like the vast majority of this world speak negativel!

 y on a topic you couldn't begin to comprehend. How could anyone who's soul hasn't been broken possibly understand what it's like to not even remember what a desire to be alive feels like. Just because people like you feel fear over dying, doesn't mean those of us who embrace the idea are wrong.""


Him:""Why would it be terrible? Because I won't be here to bring kindnesses to this sick place, what makes you think anything in this world deserves what I have to offer in the first place?""


Me:""I'm miserable right now lol. I don't think about today I think about tomorrow. My good days are in your position honestly and I enjoy that every time I'm in that position. Life can hurt but there's always a soft point. That's what you need to hold onto""


Me:""I really don't have an opinion on suicide as if it's wrong right that's a personal decision I'm a libertarian. I'm just saying that your life doesn't have to be hell it could be perfect it could be beautiful and it could all be worth it. When dying could be app for what? I mean there's a purpose to even pain.""


Me:""No because you have suffered so much for nothing you have meaning you have value. Much more than to just be thrown away like that""


Me again: ""That's at least why I don't kill myself I have value I have meaning I have a purpose and since I was 7 I knew I had to suck it up take a hell of lifestyle because the next twenty weren't going to be pretty. People hated me despised me. Still do. For no reason enough that it's hard to get a job network make friends etc... But it's all part of a plan for the future you just have to find your own tunnel and keep going and never look back. What helps you has to be you.""


He didn't respond for almost an hour and that's when I got on the phone with the suicide line then the police twice when I was about to give his information I said you there? And he replied



""Yea I'm still here. I'm tired of being conscious though so I think I'm going to go to bed.y body feels tired enough to do it. Goodnight ""

That's all the texts last night.


That's when I told the police the wrong number and all that. Should I just try to find someone else and block this guy or do I continue to play his game or teach him a lesson? That's why I'm tired of knowing what to do in this case. To get what I want to have peace to make him focus on something else idk?


Next day it just feels like he's playing me again.




Me: ""How's ur day""


Him:""I just woke up from a nap. You got a solution to my dilemma?""


Me:""Of what?""


Him: ""How to come up with all of my rent? Cause if not then still as shitty as I was last night and this morning ""



Then he doesn't seem to want to get help either.

Me:""Oh last night? I wanted to ask you something?""


Him:""What""
""??""
""Where did you go""

Me:""I was wondering do you ever find it better to talk to someone about like your stress to alleviate it? Does it make it better for you? I know for me it does.


Oh I just did my laundry. 

I don't know anything until Monday but I hope you don't have to stress over that too much. It's only one day away""

Him: ""I don't have the money for a therapist""

Me:""Like Medicaid covers that though.""

Him:""I'm a young healthy white Male, they don't help with stuff like that""

Him:""I don't have insurance given to me because of that. Like it's literally what they told me when I went to apply is those are the reasons I don't qualify""

Me:""They help with that all the time I've seen people in therapy ur age and gender all time. Anyone who applies with the lack of funds is qualified in the welfare office actually... And as a side note you told me you were Asian lol.""

Him:""I never told you I was Asian? You confuse me with other people often""

Him:""AMD last time I went to get government aid they practically laughed at me""

Me:""No you said you were 3/4 Irish and two Asian countries you said it on the phone. I've never talked to anyone on the phone you said your aunt told you that.""

Me:""Medicaid? It's just a small application they get you approved as long as you show your paystubs.""

Me:""I do it at pecos and flaminog it's behind Panda Express near planet fitness""

Me:""I could give you the address""

Him:""I told you I'm 3/4 irish and a bunch of other stuff, some Asian ethnicities are on that list but it's a long one and yea I'm telling you last time I went they didn't give a fuck about me""

Me:""Ok maybe it was someone that didn't know what they were talking about but I'm pretty sure they'd approve you and you'd be able to talk to someone. I mean from my experience it really does help to talk about stress with someone. I mean it could alleviate your pain.""

Him:""What the hell is talking going to do? How could that possibly change anything. Not to sound like a dick but really, how does that help me cover rent or get work I won't get fuckes out of as soon as they don't need me anymore. The only way to alleviate my stress is to end it""

Him:""What time are you coming out tomorrow?""

Him:""??""

Me:""Yeah well it can help with the stress of your financial straights basically. Give you the tools in how to deal with it""

Me:""Morning""

Him:""I don't see how when they don't offer things like that to people like me. If I had a kid sure they would help but I'm just me those things don't care about people like me""

Me:""I don't have kids either lol yeah they help everyone hun not just people with kids single guys told me at precision they worked less hours to keep their food stamps in fact lol. They accept everyone""

Him:""They don't accept everyone.""

Me:""Yeah they do all you have to do is fit their income requirements""

Not long after this, I wake up in the middle of the night. I guess I should note that I have a habit of checking for movement of breath if I see someone sleeping. After I wake up, it doesn't look like he is breathing (the blanket he was using made it hard to tell). I try to nudge him. Nothing.  I nudge him a few more times, still nothing. I grab his arm to shake him and his arm is ice cold (turns out he started sweating in the night and took his arms out from under the blankets to cool down).
I gasped loudly because he still hasn't woken up. I almost fall off the bed trying to turn the light on. He wakes up. He asks me what's wrong and I lose it. I break down crying.  I was so scared.

468,mentalhealth,1,"Struggling to get out of a rut, want to be more productive Hello, this is my first ever post on Reddit! Be gentle with me... 

Basically, I am struggling with my life a bit at the moment, and I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it - I don’t like talking to my family about personal stuff, and I don’t have any friends with whom I’d feel comfortable talking about myself, and not feel like a nuisance. Strangers on the internet it is, then.

To give you some backstory, I am an early-thirties female who has always been prone to feelings of sadness, loneliness, unfulfillment - though I am hesitant to use the word ‘depressed’ because I have never been suicidal, think I do have some worth, and have always hoped that life will get better and I will be happy someday.

Nothing really bad has happened to me, but life has been quite disappointing so far - I grew up with a difficult father who was sometimes abusive, and a mother who always defended him and dismissed my concerns about his behavior (and still does). I was unpopular at school, then I went to university, which I thought was going to be wonderful, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. After university I had a string of unfulfilling jobs. I’m an honest person, and I know my lack of professional success is partly due to laziness - but I also think that getting a job and being successful professionally has a lot to do with luck and being in the right place at the right time, and I think I’ve also been really unlucky. I tried for a while to get into the museum/heritage sector and did quite a bit of volunteering, and a few years back I tried to get into library work and applied for some library traineeships, none of which I got so much as an interview for.

The best thing I have done in my adult life is to get the frick out of my home country (England) and away from my family 6 years ago. I travelled Asia, lived in Australia for a while and then two years ago I moved to France, where I currently am. 

Oh, did I mention that I’ve never had a boyfriend? Yeah.

I have mostly worked as a waitress since coming to France but a few months ago I decided to train as an EFL teacher. It was a month-long intensive course, which I had to stay in a different European city to do as the city I live in doesn’t offer it. It was one of the hardest, but also one of the best things I have ever done. I had 9-5 classes every day and spent most of my evenings and weekends studying, so it was stressful, but it also felt great to be so busy and have so much going on in my life. The other people on my course were all lovely and, although I stayed in an apartment by myself, I never got lonely, because I was so busy and had plenty of interaction with my coursemates. It was everything my university experience wasn’t. 

Anyway, since coming back from the course a couple of months ago, I have struggled to live my life productively. I should be feeling excited about my new career and finally having a profession, but I’m not. My life has gone from full to empty. A language school in my city has given me a few classes to teach, but I’m still only working a couple of hours a week and am mostly relying on benefits to survive. My EFL course showed me that I AM capable of working hard and using my time wisely - I had no choice because otherwise I’d have failed the course - but, now that I have the option of doing nothing, I just do nothing. My worst habits are waking up late (like 11am), and spending most of my waking hours lying in bed playing with my smartphone. Even when I ban myself from social media sites, I still find other ways to waste time on the internet. Despite almost all my time being free, I struggle to get anything done and feel as though I have ‘no time’ for anything.

Unsurprisingly, these behaviors are making me feel like shit. I am also suffering from a lack of social interaction. I haven’t made many friends since moving to my current city two years ago, and I haven’t socialised since I came back from my course two months ago (apart from spending one week with my family at Christmas). The vast majority of my time is spent alone (I rent a room through a property guardianship organization and don’t speak much to the other people in my building). 

Oh, and being a British citizen in France with Brexit looming is not exactly doing wonders for my mental state.

I’m stuck in a rut that I desperately want to get out of. Even without a job, I could still be living a much fuller and happier life - applying for jobs, reading, making art, going for walks, meeting friends, cooking - not staying indoors not speaking to anyone and staring at my phone (much as I am doing at this very second).

I desperately want to be ‘living my best life’ (corny expression, but I like it) but I think that right now the most important thing for me is to get more teaching work so that my life has more structure, and start socializing again. But in order to do that I really need to overcome the toxic habits mentioned above that are hindering my productiveness and making me feel like crap. Today was the first day I didn’t even bother to shower, get dressed or make even a token attempt at productivity. 

To anyone who has read this far, thank you, reading back through this word-vomit I think I just feel lonely and wanted to reach out to someone, and if anyone can help me with things like getting up early, curing my smartphone addiction and being more productive, I’d be very grateful.",struggling rut want productive hello post gentle basically struggling life bit moment don t really talk don t like talking family personal stuff don t friend d feel comfortable talking feel like nuisance stranger internet backstory early thirty female prone feeling sadness loneliness unfulfillment hesitant use word depressed suicidal think worth hoped life better happy someday really bad happened life quite disappointing far grew difficult father abusive mother defended dismissed concern behavior doe unpopular school went university thought going wonderful turned complete disappointment university string unfulfilling job m honest person know lack professional success partly laziness think getting job successful professionally lot luck right place right time think really unlucky tried museum heritage sector did quite bit volunteering year tried library work applied library traineeship got interview best thing adult life frick home country england away family year ago travelled asia lived australia year ago moved france currently oh did mention boyfriend yeah worked waitress coming france month ago decided train efl teacher month long intensive course stay different european city city live doesn t offer hardest best thing class day spent evening weekend studying stressful felt great busy going life people course lovely stayed apartment got lonely busy plenty interaction coursemates university experience wasn t coming course couple month ago struggled live life productively feeling excited new career finally having profession m life gone language school city given class teach m working couple hour week relying benefit survive efl course showed capable working hard using time wisely choice d failed course option doing just worst habit waking late like spending waking hour lying bed playing smartphone ban social medium site way waste time internet despite time free struggle feel time unsurprisingly behavior making feel like shit suffering lack social interaction haven t friend moving current city year ago haven t socialised came course month ago apart spending week family christmas vast majority time spent rent room property guardianship organization don t speak people building oh british citizen france brexit looming exactly doing wonder state m stuck rut desperately want job living fuller happier life applying job reading making art going walk meeting friend cooking staying indoors speaking staring phone doing second desperately want living best life corny expression like think right important thing teaching work life structure start socializing order really need overcome toxic habit mentioned hindering productiveness making feel like crap today day didn t bother shower dressed make token attempt productivity read far thank reading word vomit think just feel lonely wanted reach help thing like getting early curing smartphone addiction productive d grateful
469,mentalhealth,1,"An update from my last vent So, hello, I was that person who said that my friends were overwhelming me to an alarming degree. I’ve since had a conversation with my best friend (MC, who has clinical anxiety and depression) and confessed to her that I was scared to tell her that I’m overwhelmed because I don’t want her to stop talking to me. She’s essentially taken three years to open up to me about her issues, and it means so much to me that she trusts me enough to talk to me, and I don’t want to lose that. But since our conversation where I finally admitted that, she’s barely talked to me, or our friends. I know that she has trauma and that’s the reason for her trust issues, but it’s not fair that I can’t be honest with my best friend. I’m just tired of being socially drained every time I hang out with my favorite people, it’s not enjoyable anymore, and I can’t be honest about that with them.

471,mentalhealth,1,"I don't know what to do, but I'm so scared... I have felt so damn low for a while now, I feel like my life has gone absolutely out of control...

About a year ago, I had suffered the worst of my anorexia, and that time it really just took over my life. I would sit in class with lots of unfinished homework and instead of doing something about it, I just kept obsessing, meal planning, calculating, looking at thinspo, etc. It was taking time from my day the way a full time job would. I was so sad, and felt so empty, that it was really the only thing that made me feel happy.

My grades dropped drastically, so did my weight, and I freaked out. I promised myself I would take a break. It was really just a huge breaking point in my life.
Of course, an eating disorder doesn't just go away, so it only made me feel more and more worthless, especially combined with everything else going on in my life. 
Before I realised it, my self worth has dropped so much, that I had to stop myself from crying and apologising after my best friend helped me move something large into our dorm room, and I just felt that I wasted her 3min that she could have spent doing something else. I feel like shit trying to accept any help from anyone at all, and it's becoming a huge problem.
I've stopped sharing my problems and feeling with anyone and everyone, and I have a feeling that it might just be because I let myself gain weight and I lost everything that held me together....

I feel so so worthless, so hopeless, so extremely tired no matter what time of day it is, and I'm doing everything I can at the moment to help myself, but I'm so scared of asking for help, because I feel like I'm being almost selfish and like I'm wasting people's time on me.
I've gone through many times when I was suicidal, but I don't even feel like I deserve that anymore. That'd be inconvenient for everyone. I even entertained that thought at my lowest points, and came to the conclusion that I would have to sell everything I own, give my pets good new homes, basically pay for my funeral before it happens, and lose as much weight as humanely possible so that it'd be easy to clean up after my body, and so it'd be light to lift up for the people taking it away. At least this is stopping me from doing anything reckless, so I have the time to snap out of it. 

Now I'm taking 2 courses, while I usually can take 3 or 4, and I haven't turned in any of my assignments on week 2 of school... I just can't get the motivation, and I feel so incredibly tired all the time. I waste most of my energy on stressing over everything. Getting food, taking a shower, or doing anything at all makes me anxious. Being in class makes me so anxious that I feel physically sick. Add to this the anxiety I've had for years including things like being afraid that I make too much noice when walking, or that I'm breathing weird, or being afraid if wearing both my headphones when listening to music because I'm scared I'll make a sound without realising it or that I'll breath too loudly without noticing. I'm even stressed about the way I might look when I walk, which makes me afraid that I walk weirdly BECAUSE I think about it too much... Recently I've become anxious over watching YouTube on full screan, and I have absolutely no idea why. It's such an intense feeling of anxiety, almost fear or sorrow that it twists my stomach, and makes me lightheaded if I let it get too far.
I am constantly angry, because I'm just so irritated by all this anxiety, and I'm so angry about being the way I am, because in my mind I am an absolute idiot, below average intelligence, and I feel like I look and act like I have down syndrome or something, but everyone has always told me the exact opposite thing. It's the most infuriating this ever. 

I'm so fucked up about all this, and I am so scared that I'll disappoint my mother. Not to mention that I want to be a good example for my little sibling who means the world to me.

Right now the only thing that makes me happy is my research and my animals, and for both I barely have enough time. I can only feel fine when I spend time with them, or when I'm writing my book.

I hate being lazy, and I go crazy if I have nothing to do. I need to be busy, but I am so damn sad, and so tired that I just can't do anything no matter how much I want to... 

I need to manage those two courses I have now, and I'm seriously considering just taking a break from school, and going to work for a little while instead. I have no time to even manage these things in my head, there is so much going on, and I'm so extremely overwhelmed...

What would you do if you were me? I'm so afraid that one day I'll just give up and end up someone I don't want to be. I have so many years in front if me, and so many people I could disappoint in that time.",don t know m scared felt damn low feel like life gone absolutely control year ago suffered worst anorexia time really just took life sit class lot unfinished homework instead doing just kept obsessing meal planning calculating looking thinspo taking time day way time job sad felt really thing feel happy grade dropped drastically did weight freaked promised break really just huge breaking point life course eating disorder doesn t just away feel worthless especially combined going life realised self worth dropped stop cry apologising best friend helped large dorm room just felt wasted min spent doing feel like shit trying accept help s huge problem stopped sharing problem feeling feeling just let gain weight lost held feel worthless hopeless extremely tired matter time day m doing moment help m scared asking help feel like m selfish like m wasting people s time gone time suicidal don t feel like deserve anymore d inconvenient entertained thought lowest point came conclusion sell pet good new home basically pay funeral happens lose weight humanely possible d easy clean body d light lift people taking away stopping doing reckless time snap m taking course usually haven t turned assignment week school just t motivation feel incredibly tired time waste energy stressing getting food taking shower doing make anxious class make anxious feel physically sick add anxiety year including thing like afraid make noice walking m breathing weird afraid wearing headphone listening music m scared ll make sound realising ll breath loudly noticing m stressed way look walk make afraid walk weirdly think recently anxious watching youtube screan absolutely idea s intense feeling anxiety fear sorrow twist stomach make lightheaded let far constantly angry m just irritated anxiety m angry way mind absolute idiot average intelligence feel like look act like syndrome told exact opposite thing s infuriating m fucked scared ll disappoint mother mention want good example little sibling mean world right thing make happy research animal barely time feel fine spend time m writing book hate lazy crazy need busy damn sad tired just t matter want need manage course m seriously considering just taking break school going work little instead time manage thing head going m extremely overwhelmed m afraid day ll just end don t want year people disappoint time

473,mentalhealth,1,"Can't sleep I haven't been able to sleep recently. After a long time of doing the whole ""I can't use mental health resources because other people need them more so if I use the resource and someone kills themselves it's my fault for barring them from getting help"" thing, I got over it and have talked to a psychiatrist. I start therapy on Tuesday. We're currently working with the idea it's likely OCD + depression or anxiety + depression. Either way, not a fun combination. These past few nights I haven't been able to sleep. I'll get really anxious in bed and my hands will feel weird (I'm not sure how to explain how my hands feel). I'll toss and turn and sleep for a couple hours at a time. I went to bed at 1:30 AM and woke up at 6 AM today, and then slept a couple hours at a time until 10 AM. Even now tryin to do homework, I can't really focus and there's a part of my brain that's convinced that if I scratch my arms a lot and/or make myself throw up I'll feel a bit better, which I know isn't really true. I don't think I'll do anything to myself so it would be a waste of resources if I were to call a hotline, but my friends are busy and I just need to hear a voice.

474,mentalhealth,1,"Had an experience after getting drunk for the first time. Should I get help? I'm usually very controlled with my alcohol. I don't drink often and when I do it's usually a glass of beer or a mild cocktail after a reasonably heavy meal. Before yesterday, I have never been drunk or high in my entire life.

Also, I know I get sad (depressed?) sometimes with occassional suicidal ideation. This started after I broke up with my ex last year and flares up on significant dates like on birthdays and holidays. I haven't sought help but it's infrequent enough that it doesn't affect my work and social life.

Yesterday I decided to throw caution to the wind and drank several shots of gin (can't remember how many) on an empty stomach at a party consisting mostly of work colleagues. I don't remember much about what happened when I was drunk but I recall screaming for my colleagues to kill me or let me die. I remember crying and begging them to let me jump out the window. I woke up with scratches and bruises on my body and a bloody toe.

None of my colleagues seem to acknowledge what happened. I don't know if they are pretending nothing happened or if I just imagined the whole thing. A few that I asked said I mumbled a bit and went to sleep, which contradicts my injuries. I don't know what the alcohol did to me. I don't know if this is normal when people get drunk. 

I hope someone can advise me what to do. Should I seek help from a mental health professional? Or would it be enough just to abstain from alcohol from now on?

Note: sorry if I am posting this in the wrong subreddit. I was considering posting it in the subreddit for alcoholics but since I'm not a habitual drinker I thought here would be more suitable.",experience getting drunk time help m usually controlled alcohol don t drink s usually glass beer mild cocktail reasonably heavy meal yesterday drunk high entire life know sad depressed occassional suicidal ideation started broke ex year flare significant date like birthday holiday haven t sought help s infrequent doesn t affect work social life yesterday decided throw caution wind drank shot gin t remember stomach party consisting work colleague don t remember happened drunk recall screaming colleague kill let die remember cry begging let jump window woke scratch bruise body bloody toe colleague acknowledge happened don t know pretending happened just imagined thing asked said mumbled bit went sleep contradicts injury don t know alcohol did don t know normal people drunk hope advise seek help professional just abstain alcohol note sorry posting wrong subreddit considering posting subreddit alcoholic m habitual drinker thought suitable

481,mentalhealth,1,"What is happening to me? Although I am not sure, but I assume I have mild OCD of type: Checkers. I basically get intrusive thoughts telling me to check that the lid of my water bottle is closed tight before going to sleep.   
And sometimes, when I unplug a certain power cord, these intrusive thoughts force me to make 100% sure that I unplugged the power cord. Or similar and less intrusive ones. But they're weak enough for me to just block them out (except for the bottle-lid one, as it's a little harder for some reason to block it). It all started a couple years ago for some reason that I am unaware of.

&amp;#x200B;

English is my second language. Now, throughout my day, I always experience weird intrusive thoughts that question the grammar of certain sentences in English. For example: I get a thought asking me: ""Is it: these types of things, or these type of things?"", this is just one example, if I decide to completely block that thought, I will do fine until another thought of the same kind pops up in my head. But if I decide to act upon the thought and inquire the correct grammar, I will get confused and really anxious. I really can't prove these English grammar structures which is why I choose to completely block these thoughts. I really speak English instinctively, I learned it while growing up. I wasn't taught it with grammar structures like adjectives, past, present, adverb and other things.  


Now English isn't the only case. It also occurs when I do Math, intrusive thoughts pop up in my head telling me to prove certain things such as why you can't cancel certain fractions algebraically. And these thoughts are more intrusive than the English ones, they really scratch my head and disrupt my focus from learning new things until I prove why you can't do certain things or why a certain thing works the way it does. Hell, I'm not even a mathematician, but I have to use everything I know to prove why it is the way it is. I believe these thoughts are more intrusive and harder to block because I can prove certain things in Math unlike in English where I can't prove grammar rules (as I don't know how to). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the most part, these thoughts don't occur in day-to-day exchanges of information, such as recalling a friend's name, writing down something, buying groceries, browsing the web and other day-to-day things.  


I believe they occur only within the scope of when I learn a new framework or a body of something.  
Note: these thoughts occur regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All of these thoughts started rampaging in my head for the past couple of weeks and it's making me really anxious, I am really worried about my mental health.

482,mentalhealth,1,"It is astonishing how many people are just broken in some way or another. I'm so afraid of breaking, too. I don't know that many people - at least not as much as a normal person in their early 20s should know - but pretty much every single one of them is currently in therapy, has had therapy, or is trying to look for a therapist.

It's crazy. And it's just so depressing for me. Nobody is really well, most people have an insane amount of bagagge, and in this city, take a shitload of speed, ketamine and/or ecstasy to at least try to combat it. 

I honestly am feeling kind of overwhelmed. On one side, I am beginning to have social life for the first time ever. On the other, it just made me realize how fucked many people I know are. 

Thing is, I try to have a ""healthy"" relationship with drugs. They're fun, and limit my usage as much as I can, but I can feel greed and probably a bit of peer pressure starting to get to me. I just don't know if I'll be able to not sink into the depths of this city. But I don't want to quit either.

I'm just so, so afraid of my last resistance to crumble.

486,mentalhealth,1,"Would I be in the wrong for getting my hair cut against my parent's explicit wishes? (Originally posted to r/AmITheAsshole but got taken down for mentions of self harm and suicide so i thought this sub might be a better place for it)


This might be a bit of a validation post, if I'm being honest. I'm angry and sad and very lost on what to do and feel seriously guilty and keep doubting myself on whether I actually want to do this.


I am a 16-year-old trans/nonbinary teenager. Please, if you're going to mention something about how I'm mentally ill or just trying to be trendy or some bullshit, leave. I don't want those comments because, frankly, I hear them every day and don't need to be reminded again. 


My parents don't fully know about my gender identity. I attempted to tell them when I was 14, but they basically told me I was just a tomboy and it has never been brought up again. My dad thinks being trans is a mental illness and transitioning to match your identity is equivalent to self harm. They know I've wanted a haircut for years. I bug my mom about it every couple days. My mom gets seriously angry at me for it because she's annoyed with my nagging, but I'm also annoyed because there are a lot worse things I could be doing to my body than just cutting my hair. I could be out fucking everyone who'll have me and getting a fucking drug addiction, but I'm not and never would. All I want is a damn haircut. She's straight-up told me, ""you're a girl and I don't want you to have a boy's haircut."" At least she's not using shitty excuses anymore and actually being honest. Doesn't make it any less ridiculous tho.


It's gotten to the level where I'm just angry all the time at everyone and everything because I feel so out of control. It's of course not *just* the hair that's causing it. It's a lot of things they've done that have hurt me, things that have affected my relationships with other people and my own mental health. Just the general knowledge that my parents refuse to accept me for who I am. The hair is just an offset of that.


I have a history of depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts and this whole ordeal has put me back into an extreme dark place. I'm worried for my own health at this point, and I know some people will see this and think ""come on -- it's just a haircut"", but it goes so much beyond that. It goes into feelings of never being good enough, of feeling like a trophy to my parents, of having my appearance matter more to them than my comfort, of just feeling extremely invaluable to them as a whole, of knowing that they do not show the same respect for me that I do for them. It's caused me to act out and get into rather large arguments with them lately and I feel sick and sad all the time.


Maybe this post doesn't even belong on this sub. I'm unsure of where I should post. But would I be the asshole if went and got my hair cut without their permission/against their explicit wishes?? Is it illegal for me to do so?? Would the hair stylist get in trouble because they cut a minor's hair without parents' permission?? I don't want anyone else to get in trouble due to my actions either. Should I just tough it out another couple years so I can get a haircut then??


Again, I think this is kind of a validation post and I apologize. I just need to know I'm not alone in this.

491,mentalhealth,1,"I don't just not learn from mistakes. I don't seem to learn at all. I often run into situations where I need to learn several things, and will tackle them one at a time (after multi tasking produced no results). Once I've sufficiently learned one thing, pretty much mastered it, I move onto the next thing...and slip on what I learned before until it's as if I never learned it. I seem to be only be capable of focusing on one time at a time, EVER, and can never learn something new without losing my ability to do what I just mastered.

This has been an issue in jobs and therapy (anything with skill learning) and relationships where I need to put effort into changing my behavior. School was somewhat easy because I didn't have to retain info from one semester to the next. Because of my inability to learn and make it stick, my longest relationship was 1.5 years and my longest job was maybe 5 months. Yet, my doctors don't seem to think I have attention issues that are separate from anxiety and they never felt this way. But this feels like more than just attention problems.

I don't know how this happened or if I've always been like this. I know I was on Lithium for 6 weeks and didn't respond well to it, even going to the ER for suspected lithium toxicity at one point (they decided that my lithium levels were actually lower than normal since I puked so much), and I swear I haven't felt ""with it"" since but 1. No one believes me, they think it's an excuse and 2. I don't know what can be done about it. I also wonder if just the wear and tear that 2 decades of mental illness has had on my brain could be a cause. I'm currently unmedicated because I had genetic testing done that showed I don't metabolize most psych meds at prescribable doses, and once I was yanked off the meds I really hoped there'd be a change.

496,mentalhealth,1,"Feeling lost, empty and confused after a breakup Not sure where else to post this so gonna put it here because I do feel this has been really affecting me mentally. 

My girlfriend broke up with me yesterday, but it was my doing. We’d only been together for about two months or so, but the first month or so was just so incredible. She made me so happy and I was so sure I’d found my soulmate, life was looking very good for me - better than it ever has before. 

However, these intense feelings I had for her seemingly disappeared almost overnight, and I don’t know why. To go from feeling as amazing about her as I did to feeling nothing towards her has made me feel very empty. Life now seems boring and pointless and I have no motivation to do anything. The enjoyment has been sucked out of everything, not just the relationship I had with her. She tried to help me as best she can but nothing has worked, and she had to break up with me because she couldn’t handle how cold and distant I had become, and how I was unable to return her affection like I once could. I don’t blame her at all, she didn’t deserve this to happen to her and I feel so guilty that I’ve put her through this - I know that she’s heartbroken over it. 

The thing is, I feel even more empty and lonely without her, and I feel like I have nobody to turn to. All I’ve been able to do today is lay in bed feeling nothing. I can’t enjoy anything that I used to, and I’m barely able to even make myself eat at the moment. I just can’t see how I’m going to feel any better any time soon, or how this emptiness is going to go away, and it scares me because I think I’ve always been in a good place mentally until now.",feeling lost confused breakup sure post gonna feel really affecting mentally girlfriend broke yesterday doing d month month just incredible happy sure d soulmate life looking good better intense feeling seemingly disappeared overnight don t know feeling amazing did feeling feel life boring pointless motivation enjoyment sucked just relationship tried help best worked break couldn t handle cold distant unable return affection like don t blame didn t deserve happen feel guilty know s heartbroken thing feel lonely feel like turn able today lay bed feeling t enjoy used m barely able make eat moment just t m going feel better time soon emptiness going away scare think good place mentally
497,mentalhealth,1,"Looking to make some changes (F19) Hi all,
I’ve been having on-off episodes where I feel very down and depressed and lonely. I feel anxious about other people and my lack of friends, and then I get really down and feel very alone. However, since they only came on and off again- I’d have brief periods of happiness, then deep depressive episodes which didn’t last too long- I wrote it off as a non-problem.

However, a few days ago I had a severe episode where I had some awful thoughts about being alone and hurting myself and drank a dangerous amount, making myself really sick. It might have been worse, had my friend not been there to help me. It’s this that’s made me think that something has to change, and I need to confront this problem before I  have another episode.

What would you guys recommend? I’m not sure what direction to go in- for all I know, I could be overreacting, and there’s nothing wrong. Would you recommend I talk to a GP about this?

What's so bad? The heating still isn't working. On the 1st of january I was messaging my flatmate who was in the flat at the time who said the heating and hot water hadn't been working for several days. So I called the office (the third time we've had no heating since september) and they said they'd sort it. On the 7th I visited for the day and my flatmate said the heating still hadn't been fixed. So my dad talked to the landlord who came checked it out and it was working for a while.

Today when I arrived the heating wasn't working again, according to my flatmate it was working for a while but then stopped again (and they had some more issues with no hot water for several days). All my flatmates have fan heaters from the office however they do not have any left for me (there are apparently 5 fan heaters however there are 30 flats and about 150 residents and who knows how many are having heating issues this time round) so my dad bought one for me. Technically I am not allowed to own a fan heater but living in a freezing flat has been really damaging to my mental health and can affect my diabetes as well.

501,mentalhealth,1,"A hard breakup, i need advise (serious reply’s only) Hey, i’ve never used reddit before so idk how to do this, or if it’s okay to post it on here lol. 
i was dumped 2 days ago, by someone i thought was the love of my life. recently, my mental health was getting worse, i was overthinking more, i was crying more, i was pulling myself away more. this has happened before, a year prior. when i met my former boyfriend, i told him when i was low, and i said i may be like that again. he promised to stay and look after me if it ever happens. we never argued, we never had disagreements, when we were sad we talked it out. everyone thought we would last. everyone thought we were soulmates. so did we. i have been diagnosed with having anxiety, depression, and being hyper sensitive. 
around November 2019, i started to dip into my depression again. i told him this, he supported me, he said he’d never leave. he spent everyday together, he held me and made me feel okay again. i told him if i ever get too much, he could tell me. he promised me he would never give up on me. i believed him. he started talking to his ex on snapchat, but they were together only in the 2nd year of high school. so a while ago now, they were 13. but he said he was really hurt by her. i started seeing a physiologist again, once a week. but i felt it didn’t help. but he was so proud of me, i was doing it for him. 
January 14th, he said that he was starting to be in a bad mindset too, and that he believed my mental illness was caused by him. we nearly broke up, but i convinced him it wasn’t him, because it truly wasn’t. he stayed and everything felt normal again. but ever since then, i cried every night thinking that it would happen again, he would try leave me, i would be alone. January 17th, he came to my house, i cried constantly because i felt he was going to leave me, but he held me and he promised me he’d never ever leave me. i believed him. i fell asleep in his arms, and i woke up crying even harder, believing he would leave and he held me tighter and told me he never would. he cuddled me while my father drove him home, the last thing he said was “i love you, i’ll never leave” and he got out the car and put his hands into a heart shape and waved goodbye, walked into his house. that night he told me he wasn’t feeling great, i told him to speak to his mother because she might be able to help. his mother said he should break up with me, i don’t know why. that night, i called him, sobbing my eyes out, my mother had to come and talk to him because i couldn’t. i cried so hard. he left me and told me he felt he wasn’t good enough. we were together for nearly a year. nothing felt real in the situation. he wouldn’t stop saying how much he loved me, how much he cared for me, how he never wanted to leave but thought he had to, to work on himself. i let him. but my heart won’t let me leave him alone. i keep messaging him, telling him how i feel, how worried i am about him. i’ve been speaking to him ever since, i know it’s wrong. but he’s been talking to me too, he’s been replying to my private story, when he sees i’m sad. i tell him he shouldn’t be he tells me he wants to. he tells me he still loves me, he misses me. but today i asked him if he still saw a future with me, he said he didn’t know, he didn’t think so. but only because he thought he wasn’t good enough, he feels i’m still good enough for him, but he’s no good for me. he was my happiness while the world was falling down. i can’t sleep, i can’t eat, i worry so much about him. i worry he will never come back, like i will never become better again. i miss him. but he’s blocked him location from me, he says he needs space. he’s taken me off his private stories, but he says he still wants on mine. he still says he loves me, he cares for me. his feelings haven’t changed. he never lies. i’m so scared, i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to be replaced. i keep feeling like his ex will replace me, i know they speak a lot, i’m scared she’s part of the reason why he’s gone. he keeps telling me he still loves me, he still misses me. but he says he’ll never come back. 
i speak to my mother and dad who have both been through mental health and relationships with it, they say they think he will come back, to give him time. they saw how much he cared for me, they thought themselves we would last. they treated him like a son. i don’t know what to do guys, someone else give me advise. i keep checking on him, when i was still able to, i kept checking his location, to see if he was okay. not to hurt himself, if he was with his ex, if he was ignoring me. if he was okay. i’m still so so so worried. i miss him so much, and i want him back so bad. i need him so bad right now. i’m heart broken. can someone please give me advise. please don’t hate on me, i’m trying my best to get through this. but i still believe he was my soulmate, and he even says he still believes too. is his mental health taking over his feelings? or will he really never come back? someone please help. i need help. thank you for reading",hard breakup need advise reply s hey used idk s okay post lol dumped day ago thought love life recently getting worse overthinking cry pulling away happened year prior met boyfriend told low said like promised stay look happens argued disagreement sad talked thought thought soulmates did diagnosed having anxiety depression hyper sensitive november started dip depression told supported said d leave spent everyday held feel okay told tell promised believed started talking ex snapchat nd year high school ago said really hurt started seeing physiologist week felt didn t help proud doing january th said starting bad mindset believed illness caused nearly broke convinced wasn t truly wasn t stayed felt normal cried night thinking happen try leave january th came house cried constantly felt going leave held promised d leave believed fell asleep arm woke cry harder believing leave held tighter told cuddled father drove home thing said love ll leave got car hand heart shape waved goodbye walked house night told wasn t feeling great told speak mother able help mother said break don t know night called sobbing eye mother come talk couldn t cried hard left told felt wasn t good nearly year felt real situation wouldn t stop saying loved cared wanted leave thought work let heart won t let leave messaging telling feel worried speaking know s wrong s talking s replying private story see m sad tell shouldn t tell want tell love miss today asked saw future said didn t know didn t think thought wasn t good feel m good s good happiness world falling t sleep t eat worry worry come like better miss s blocked location say need space s taken private story say want say love care feeling haven t changed lie m scared don t know don t want replaced feeling like ex replace know speak lot m scared s reason s gone keep telling love miss say ll come speak mother dad relationship say think come time saw cared thought treated like son don t know guy advise checking able kept checking location okay hurt ex ignoring okay m worried miss want bad need bad right m heart broken advise don t hate m trying best believe soulmate say belief taking feeling really come help need help thank reading
502,mentalhealth,1,"I can't cope anymore. I can honestly say I've never been fully happy for about four years. The last time I genuinely felt happy was back in 2016. I think it was because I was at an age when I didn't have half the pressure put on me I do now. I can't relax at all, even for half a minute. If it's not worrying that my parents will beat each other up or be violent towards one another, it's worrying that I'll be stabbed to death in front of my house or I'll get raped/attacked if I leave the house. I can safely say that I don't know what it feels like to be safe anymore, and because I often go out by myself I feel it's easier for people to potentially take advantage of me being by myself for their own benefit. At the moment it feels like safety is a luxury or a desire as opposed to a nesescity at the moment and that concerns me, because I feel like I should be able to leave my house and not feel in danger constantly.  I'm sick of trying to stay strong , as it where, when all I feel like doing is slitting my skin untill I bleed out and die from blood loss.

504,mentalhealth,1,"Need to vent over severe guilt of my dads medical state. The end of August my dad was in a car accident. He is 69, and was pretty banged up but he was expected to make a pretty decent recovery. He spent a week in the icu while he was recovering from the accident and getting surgeries to fix his wrist, hip and pelvis. After that they transferred him upstairs for 1 night of observation and then he was supposed to be discharged to a temporary rehabilitation facility. I was there when they moved him from the icu and stayed to make sure he was comfortable and had everything he needed. He started acting odd but I had someplace I had to be, so I went and talked to his nurse and told her I was concerned about his behavior and breathing. She sent respiratory in and I said my goodbye and left. I wasnt even 30 minutes down the road when I got a call that they couldn't find his heartbeat. He had stopped breathing shortly after I left, and wasnt being monitored. Their best guess is he was without oxygen for 27 minutes. He was in a medically induced coma for a few days while his body recovered. It took a few days after they stopped the meds for him to wake up. I was asked to ok a tracheotomy and having a feeding tube placed while he was under. Even after he woke up he was more or less a vegetable. On full vent and he would only occasionally follow movements. He has slowly gotten better, but he will never be the man I said goodbye to in August. And it's my fault. I knew something was wrong. He knew it too. I know I let his nurse know but I should have stayed until I knew he was ok for sure. The guilt is going to kill me. I already suffer from ptsd and anxiety. I am constantly either in the verge of crying, hopelessly depressed, having panic attacks or just a blank emotionless husk pretending I'm ok. I'm realizing more and more everyday how much I miss and neglected the relationship I had with my dad, and how he will never be the same man again, even if he recovers he will never be the same.

505,mentalhealth,1,"What meds are you currently taking and what for? Do you feel like they're helping? Just a question out of curiosity because I wanna know how life's going for y'all.

I'm currently taking celexa, trazodone, and birth control. Celexa for depression, trazodone for insomnia, and birth control just for my period cramps.

Trazodone works amazing for me, I always fall asleep whenever I want after I take it. It also always gives me vivid dreams while I sleep, which I used to never experience, so it's a nice touch.

I think my celexa works alright too, probably more than I realize. Sometimes I run out of, forget to take, or just don't feel like taking my meds and it's always a grave mistake. Only thing is is that I'm super tired, like, 24/7 now which is kind of the opposite of how I was before my meds. I'm not sure if this is a side effect of celexa or just the effects of trazodone bleeding into the next day.

Birth control is fine.

509,mentalhealth,1,"How to know if Rhodiola is working? What should i be ‘looking’ for? Because i’m always anxious so i don’t know the feeling of NOT being anxious really... I’m trying adaptogens mainly for my daily anxiety i get now, and maybe it’ll ease my depression.
I’m trying Rhodiola this time - i recently have tried Ashwagandha, Holy Basil and now this one.  Ashwagandha (300,600, then 1200 mg) i tried for 5 months.
Holy Basil (450mg) tried for 2 months. (started to get impatient bc no effect)
So the previous adaptogens have no had much luck with me. 

I’m not sure if it’s because I don’t know how to identify the feeling of relief from anxiety/depression, because i’ve had generalized anxiety &amp; low mood/depression most of my life so it’s like i REALLY don’t know or know how to know, the feeling of being ‘not depressed’ or ‘not anxious’ because i’ve always felt it. 

So i’m in day 5 &amp; been taking 300mg (1 capsule) to start, and when i hit 1 week or maybe even like 10 days, i will double the dose to the “recommended dose” given which is 600mg. 

If you’ve tried this, or any adaptogen really, what did you notice? 

Did you feel yourself not get worried about something that once did? 
Did it make you sleepy ? (heard it can have that calming affect but i have yet to experience that)
Was your dose the recommended amount or was it more/less?
Did you add any other adaptogens or herbal remedies that helped increase the adaptogenic affect ?

I tried doing my first internship last year but literally anything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong. The people were always yelling at me and being verry rude. I got jobs that had nothing to do with my education, they pushed me in other rooms to do irrelevant shit to get rid of me and on top of all that they told stories about me that weren’t true at all. It felt like I was back in highschool, this one time, these adults would sat at a table during lunch, i would go sit at their table and try to socialise despite my anxiety. When they saw me they all got up, and sat at another table leaving me alone. 

Ofcourse me being a instable anxious mess, had anxiety and panick attacks on the daily. I left crying, cried all night and cried when i had to back. Eventuelly i ended this internship, failed the course and had to do an extra year of college.

Now a year later I have to try again. I’m terrified and i don’t know how to get through this. This internship lasts 3 months, the next one lasts 6 months. After this i can finally graduate... but i just don’t know how to get through this..

I would get random dizziness, hallucinations, feeling a little lost, but I'm concious that it isn't normal and I know it will end in a minute or so, so I usually just stop what I'm doing and wait for it to pass.

I've never been able to find if there is a name for what I have or if anyone has ever even felt this before, but I'm sure I won't be the first.

Internet is showing schizophrenia, but I can't see anything that says it can be there for a minute and then go away.

The worst I have had was maybe 10 episodes in a day, and that was extreme.

First started in early 2012 along with a virus I had.

Any info/help would be greatly appreciated, thanks :)

P.s i would see a doctor but my initial thought is fear it could affect my employment, I am currently easily able to get by it and more.",closest thing seen experience schizophrenia experienced year ago awesome year day ago symptom hit hard day headache random dizziness hallucination feeling little lost m concious isn t normal know end minute usually just stop m doing wait pas able felt m sure won t internet showing schizophrenia t say minute away worst maybe episode day extreme started early virus info help greatly appreciated thanks p s doctor initial thought fear affect employment currently easily able
512,mentalhealth,1,"I feel... good? Read my previous posts and you will see pretty much depressive posts exclusively. A week ago I had a breakdown that left me afraid I would hurt myself soon. It was unbelievably scary. The day after, on Monday, I felt all calm and relaxed. It was so weird. Less than a day before I was crying my eyes out feeling afraid I would hurt myself. Now, here I was, calm and relaxed. Not only did I feel calm and relaxed, but I also felt optimistic. I felt like this is the year I will see improvements. I turn 24 in a few weeks, and so far, my 20’s have been just full of depressive periods. But... 2020 is the year things will change. I am going to start making friends and, after I’ve started making friends, I am going to start dating people. And this is all happening this year. I’ve been a loner for 14 years, but I won’t be a loner for 15 years. This is the year everything changes.

I don’t think I’ve ever felt this optimistic about my social and my romantic life. Certainly not in many, many years. I had completely given up. I’ve been trying to accept life as a loner for years now. This is very weird but also very real. Perhaps it’s the fact that, because of how I felt on Sunday in regards to harming myself, I know I cannot allow for anything else to happen. It HAS to work. And it HAS to work this year. I’m not sure I could go on like this for another year or two. So this will be the year things changes.

What have I done so far? I’ve reached out to my cousin who has never been in a similar situation. She is very kind and supportive and has offered to help me through this. I will start attending a biweekly gaming evening at the university, and I will also attend a speed friending event at the university next month. I do my best to keep negativity out of my life now. Anyone who doesn’t seem supportive or is kind of negative towards me will be out of my life. Oh and I also want to see if there is any speed dating events in my city. Not the biggest city in the world but I am sure there must be something. If not, I will check out some online dating stuff and ask my cousin for some help. Or maybe my new group of friends will be helpful too. Perhaps one of them is someone I’d be interested in dating. Or perhaps some of them know someone looking for a date.

Sorry for this long post but I feel like it was needed.

514,mentalhealth,1,"I wish I had never touched a hookah... Hey guys, this might be one of the craziest posts that you have ever read on here (I am pretty sure). First, I have suffered from severe health anxiety and OCD my whole life (I am 21). OCD is a genetic thing for me, as my father also has it. Basically, I get super scared when something happens to my health, even if there is no apparent reason. What does this have to do with hookah? Let me explain...

An incident happened exactly 3 years ago, where I fainted after taking deep hits in a hookah bar (unexperienced smoker). After this incident, I lived perfectly fine for about 1,5 years. Then, I read some German articles that were published at the time which severely triggered my health anxiety. I then made this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/9v3fow/bad\_hookah\_experience\_should\_i\_be\_worried/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/9v3fow/bad_hookah_experience_should_i_be_worried/)

The next months (I was taking a gap year after high school to build my business), I fell into a deep hole of anxiety and depression because I now thought that there was something wrong with me because of carbon monoxide poisoning (Which does not really make sense, since I never noticed anything being wrong with me during that 1.5 year span: I excelled in high school, built a business on the side, even got into a highly ranked university). You can read it in the post, but after I fainted, I felt perfectly fine (no more symptoms), so I did not go to the ER. Basically, in the articles it says that you have to get oxygen treatment immediately after, to get the CO out of your system, otherwise you risk permanent brain damage/cognitive issues etc.. I did not know that at the time, and since I was feeling so good after fainting, I thought I had just oversmoked (I was blowing rings and holding the smoke in) , so I did not go to the ER, which I now DEEPLY regret.

So I have talked to over 5 doctors about this, all of them told me I had nothing to worry about and even thought I was crazy lol. I was taking antidepressants for the first time to calm me down, and somehow after a few months I overcame my anxiety and started living normally again. I was super proud of myself and thinking ""how did you waste months dwelling on something that stupid??"" I was 10 months free of anxiety (just stopped thinking about it), doing super well, got into a highly university in September, got very good grades, but then in November, I was burning myself out because I was working/studying almost 100 hours per week, and then I started obsessing about that incident again. I had a complete mental breakdown because my thoughts were driving me crazy again, feelings of guilt: ""Why didnt you go to the ER??"", ""You are not as smart as you could have been...""

I began researching again, and became even more anxious. I was risking to drop out of university, started neglecting studying and socializing because my anxiety was just too much(How crazy does that sound??) Basically, now I am back on antidepressants and I began doing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with a psychiatrist to help me. I know this is a mental illness that I have (OCD), but it was triggered again only because of some stupid incident in a hookah bar. At the time, I did not think of it as a big deal (the articles were not published back then), but me being a hypochondriac, I just cannot deal with scary health information that I read online.

I have not smoked ever since, because it has left me truly traumatized. I really think I developed some form of PTSD because of it. I know that I am overly exaggerating things but I just wish I had never touched a hookah (even though I enjoyed it from time to time), because of all the stress it has brought me. As an extremely anxious person, I have never done any drugs etc. and since hookah is a really big thing here (70% of all 18-25 yr olds have tried it at least once here), I never thought that I was putting my health at a bigger risk. I really feel like I am stuck in the past, unable to look forward. My anxiety is telling me to go see another 10 doctors, but I know that it will not change shit. I just want to live my life again without thinking that there is something wrong with my health.

Sometimes I want to go back and change it, but I cannot... I know that fainting has happened to many people from smoking hookah, and that it can have various reasons (lack of oxygen, nicotine, standing up too quickly etc.), but the fact that it could have been carbon monoxide poisoning is just making me nuts (I cannot even google it anymore because it makes me feel extremely anxious). I have never put drugs inside my body, but at this point I see myself having damaged my health the same way as a heroin addict.

It is quite ironic that the thing that I used to calm down on the weekends ends up giving me the most stress in my life. I do not know why I am even making this post. Maybe I just want people telling me that I am in fact crazy, which I already know. Maybe its just to distract me from googling specialists in hyperbaric oxygen treatment in my area, which I have already done several times this week. Or maybe I just wanted to share my crazy obsessive thoughts that have tortured me for the last months/years and that I was never able to share with anyone. I am feeling a bit hopeless, not gonna lie.

The antidepressants are working well and I am doing a bit better now. I just have to get my shit together and not let a single incident dictate the rest of my life (I mean, there are people that had way worse things happen to them??). I overcame this anxiety once, so chances are, that I will be able to do it again... If someone has some helpful life advice, I would really appreciate it. If not, then at least I have provided you with an insight as to how OCD thoughts can mess somebody up...",wish touched hookah hey guy craziest post read pretty sure suffered severe anxiety ocd life ocd genetic thing father basically super scared happens apparent reason doe hookah let explain incident happened exactly year ago fainted taking deep hit hookah bar unexperienced smoker incident lived perfectly fine year read german article published time severely triggered anxiety post r hookah comment v fow bad\_hookah\_experience\_should\_i\_be\_worried r hookah comment v fow bad_hookah_experience_should_i_be_worried month taking gap year high school build business fell deep hole anxiety depression thought wrong carbon monoxide poisoning doe really make sense noticed wrong year span excelled high school built business got highly ranked university read post fainted felt perfectly fine symptom did er basically article say oxygen treatment immediately risk permanent brain damage cognitive issue did know time feeling good fainting thought just oversmoked blowing ring holding smoke did er deeply regret talked doctor told worry thought crazy lol taking antidepressant time calm month overcame anxiety started living normally super proud thinking did waste month dwelling stupid month free anxiety just stopped thinking doing super got highly university september got good grade november burning working studying hour week started obsessing incident complete breakdown thought driving crazy feeling guilt didnt er smart began researching anxious risking drop university started neglecting studying socializing anxiety just crazy doe sound basically antidepressant began doing cognitive behavioral therapy psychiatrist help know illness ocd triggered stupid incident hookah bar time did think big deal article published hypochondriac just deal scary information read online smoked left truly traumatized really think developed form ptsd know overly exaggerating thing just wish touched hookah enjoyed time time stress brought extremely anxious person drug hookah really big thing yr old tried thought putting bigger risk really feel like stuck past unable look forward anxiety telling doctor know change shit just want live life thinking wrong want change know fainting happened people smoking hookah various reason lack oxygen nicotine standing quickly fact carbon monoxide poisoning just making nut google anymore make feel extremely anxious drug inside body point having damaged way heroin addict quite ironic thing used calm weekend end giving stress life know making post maybe just want people telling fact crazy know maybe just distract googling specialist hyperbaric oxygen treatment area time week maybe just wanted share crazy obsessive thought tortured month year able share feeling bit hopeless gonna lie antidepressant working doing bit better just shit let single incident dictate rest life mean people way worse thing happen overcame anxiety chance able helpful life advice really appreciate provided insight ocd thought mess somebody

530,mentalhealth,1,"What paperwork do I need to ask for to show my job? Or how should I properly explain my situation? Or am I just screwed right now? I live in California.

I went to my primary doctor the other day about my frequent memory loss.  During this visit the doctor told me that I have had anxiety disorder, and has diagnosed me with it a while ago, but I wasn't informed (or he told me and I forgot.  go figure). He said I need a Neurocognitive evaluation. On Friday, after calling out from work to handle important things, I had probably the worst day in my life in a VERY LONG time, and had, I guess it was, a 3.5 hour anxiety attack. So now I'm also wanting to get on anxiety medicine because I don't want my life held hostage for hours by any more attacks.

The big problem is it has been affecting my work badly. I'm forgetting things, and it's greatly straining my job position. I keep getting talked to and they are getting more serious and I feel I'm getting very close to having my job in jeopardy.  **I can't lose my job**.  I'm moving into a studio apartment in a week to get out of a bad living situation.  If I lose my job, or even get demoted I won't be able to afford the place.

So, tomorrow I am calling a Psychiatrist office near my new apartment about anxiety medicine.  I am also waiting to hear from my health insurance about a where I can go to do the evaluation that is in-network. I can't go to an emergency room because the visit would financially make it where I can't pay the 1st month rent. But work has expressed that the expectation of my job requires me to be able to handle it immediately. I'm thinking they are tired of my explication/excuses even though they say they are supportive. (""We are supportive, but we need to have these things you are messing up fixed now"").

So....is there a paperwork I can ask the psychiatrist and psychologist when I see them that says ""Here is what we are working on to correct Triox's mental problems, and it may take some time to kick in"" that I can give to my job, so that they can't just write me up/fire me on the next mistake?

535,mentalhealth,1,"I'm paranoid about food safety? I don't know if this is the place to post this, but is it normal? does anyone else have this thing where they are paranoid about the safety of food?

I can eat the foods, but if I - at any point - get an idea in my head that it may not be safe (cooking chicken etc) I'm paranoid about it nd it makes me really struggle to eat it.

Particular foods include rice, pasta, chicken, pork, eggs, untoasted crumpets and muffins, oranges, bananas and more I can't even think of right now.

one example is of rice I was cooking for a curry. it was boiling and I strained it, and I tried a bit to see if it was cooked. It was still a bit hard to chew - meaning I hadn't left it long enough. This automatically made me extremely paranoid about its safety. I told my self to get over it, and it would be fine and served up my dinner. I got about 2 mouthfuls in and started thinking about it again. I literally couldn't eat the rice, so put it to the side, I was going to eat the chicken but then started worrying that the chicken wasn't cooked either, even though it was obvious it was. I ended up binning the entire dinner and having toast that night.

It's awful. My mum was eating boiled eggs the other day, and she said if was a bit runner than she liked. I automatically got really paranoid and worried that she was going to get ill from it. She is fine, and said it was cooked just funnier, but I saw it that it was raw. And she was going to get food poisoning.",m paranoid food safety don t know place post normal doe thing paranoid safety food eat food point idea head safe cooking chicken m paranoid nd make really struggle eat particular food include rice pasta chicken pork egg untoasted crumpet muffin orange banana t think right example rice cooking curry boiling strained tried bit cooked bit hard chew meaning hadn t left long automatically extremely paranoid safety told self fine served dinner got mouthful started thinking literally couldn t eat rice going eat chicken started worrying chicken wasn t cooked obvious ended binning entire dinner having toast night s awful mum eating boiled egg day said bit runner liked automatically got really paranoid worried going ill fine said cooked just funnier saw raw going food poisoning

542,mentalhealth,1,"Been a sex addict since 11 years old. Little background : I'm 18 years old, I started watching porn at the age of 11 but I didn't have good internet back then so it was mostly masturbating to my imagination. At first it was no problem. Then soon I started getting overwhelmed by the feelings and I couldn't stop myself from watching porn even if others were sitting next to me ( obviously they didn't have clear view of the screen or me. )

Soon after I started getting into relationships. At first I thought that I really was in love with every girl from them, but recently I realized that I never felt love, it was just extremely strong sexual impulses. I never grabbed women or forced them or anything like that, but the thoughts never stopped. Never. For 7 freaking years, it's only been getting worse. A lot worse.

Sex and porn have been basically controlling my life. I stopped looking at women as other people whom I can form an emotional connection with. It was just the sex. As soon as I feel myself getting attached or something I gotta bail because I knew that it wasn't love it was just sexual.

Anyway I lost my V card at like 15 or so. It was horrible. Not because I didn't know what to do or because I didn't like the girl I was with, but because I didn't feel anything. I was thrusting like an animal but I still didn't feel anything. The first time I did it like that for 15 minutes and I just told her to stop. Second time I did it for a long time and I still didn't feel anything.

What I feel guilty about though is that sometimes I get a little rough during sex, like choking her and pulling her head closer when she's giving me a BJ until she gags. I don't mean to do it like that, I just get caught in the moment a lot.

And now I feel so guilty that I'm pretending to love a girl although I'm just using her for sex and I have no feelings for her.

What's really bad though is the amount of times it gets me in embarrassing situations, like getting caught kissing someone at school, having sex in the school bathroom, almost getting caught masturbating, people asking me why I take too long in the bathrooms, the countless times I got to school late because I woke up with a boner and had to jerk it off away because it hurts, not eating lunch because I spent lunch time jerking off ..

It's ruining my life, even when I was meaning to do homework and stuff I either start watching porn or get caught up sexting someone. On average I do it 2 times a day. Sometimes I get too busy all day and can't do it, but sometimes I'm free and do it 5 times, maybe even more.

I'm trying to study right now but I can't because I literally have 7 porn windows open that I'm going to watch.

I never talked about this to anyone and I can't because where I live sex is a taboo.

I'm basically the guy from the movie ""shame"". I'm even at the later stage at the end of the movie where females don't even satisfy anymore ..",sex addict year old little background m year old started watching porn age didn t good internet masturbating imagination problem soon started getting overwhelmed feeling couldn t stop watching porn sitting obviously didn t clear view screen soon started getting relationship thought really love girl recently realized felt love just extremely strong sexual impulse grabbed woman forced like thought stopped freaking year s getting worse lot worse sex porn basically controlling life stopped looking woman people form emotional connection just sex soon feel getting attached gotta bail knew wasn t love just sexual lost v card like horrible didn t know didn t like girl didn t feel thrusting like animal didn t feel time did like minute just told stop second time did long time didn t feel feel guilty little rough sex like choking pulling head closer s giving bj gag don t mean like just caught moment lot feel guilty m pretending love girl m just using sex feeling s really bad time get embarrassing situation like getting caught kissing school having sex school bathroom getting caught masturbating people asking long bathroom countless time got school late woke boner jerk away hurt eating lunch spent lunch time jerking s ruining life meaning homework stuff start watching porn caught sexting average time day busy day t m free time maybe m trying study right t literally porn window open m going watch talked t live sex taboo m basically guy movie shame m later stage end movie female don t satisfy anymore

545,mentalhealth,1,"Anyone else have trouble working? I’m a 28 year old woman, diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorders at 17. Due to my mental health issues, I didn’t get my first job until I was 24. I’m at a point in my life where I’m able to work part time, but start to get overwhelmed around the 20 hour mark.

On the outside, I’m “normal”. When opportunities for promotion present themselves, coworkers ask me why I don’t go for them. After all, I’m almost 30, I’m not in school, I don’t have another job, I don’t have any kids, and I look healthy enough. Each time, I awkwardly try to explain that I have anxiety, but I don’t think people understand the extent of it.

I really do want to get a full time job someday (preferably at my current workplace), but I don’t think I’m ready yet. Maybe I am ready, but too afraid to take the next step, because I like working here, and don’t want to leave my company if I’m not able to handle it. Or maybe I’m not ready, and never will be. Are there people who try to work full time, but despite their best efforts, can’t do it?

In the meantime, I am working on other things to improve myself, such as losing weight and taking better care of myself, physically and mentally. I’m not sure what I’m looking for by posting here. It’s been nice to get this stuff off my chest, but if you have any advice, or if you’re in a similar situation, I’d love to hear it.

547,mentalhealth,1,"Feeling sad, down and defeated as a partner of someone who suffers greatly from mental health issues. My girlfriend just had a major episode/breakdown. She suffers greatly from abandonment issues and broke down crying hysterically for an hour or more, along with cutting herself slightly with a scissor (I was unaware of this at the time).

I am to blame as I just didn’t have the energy to console her when she needed me. We both were feeling a bit annoyed with each other once we got home from visiting my relatives. She wished me a goodnight a few hours later as a means to talk and be warm, but I wasn’t ready to talk as of yet. So this lead her to have a major episode. It was major because I still didn’t want to reaffirm her right away as I always do. This is very draining on me; always having to sacrifice my emotions, to help her feel better that she didn’t do anything wrong and not to worry about it. It feels like I’m never allowed to feel my emotions because she takes it personal as if she did something wrong and as if we have to break up right away (abandonment issues). 

So this time I just held out longer in apologizing while she was in the next room crying and cutting herself. Even after I checked on her and started to reassure her, it wasn’t enough to stop her from trying to leave, and crying even more, much more. 

In the end, I was able to console her and she feels much better and is asleep now. While I’m left feeling very drained, tremendously sadden for her wishing I can take away her pain, and be a better partner. But it all gets very draining. I’m human too and have my emotions and own issues. It’s very hard to put my emotions aside to help her feel better in a time when I should be allowed to feel my emotions. 

I also feel very emotional for her as her family is shit. She lost her sister to cancer when they were young, her mother abandoned her at a young age and her father is a narcissist. She’s in so much pain. I just wish I can be better for her, but scared as well that I can’t keep doing this. I suffer myself from issues and this is just too much pain. 

Her pain saddens me. She’s such an amazing person. Has so much potential. But is lost in thoughts and emotions out of her control. 

On top of it all, It’s so damn hard to find a decent place for her to go to for therapy. She has insurance but many places offer such bad care. If anyone knows of anything good trauma related therapy locations in NYC please let me know.

I have been growing closer to her and honestly been starting to think about marriage. Well, we got tipsy over dinner and I brought up marriage and we were having a really good discussion about it, and then I brought up that if we got married her debt and mine would consolidate and I would have to start paying more. I didn't word this well. Well, I'm an idiot. And she didn't take this well. Her father commit suicide around seven or eight years ago, and debt was one of the major reasons. So I try to smooth it over and it's not going well, and I'm making about me being upset. I had to go to the bathroom to have a panic attack about ruining another anniversary (last year I also did something stupid to ruin it). Things escalated, my girlfriend started talking to me very harshly on the street, I walked away in a panic, she got upset with me for leaving her alone on a scary street in a strange city. We took a cab home and things got worse, I started hitting myself, she was hurt by this, and it culminated in me saying I wish I were dead. This is the one thing I had always told myself I would never say to her. I have suicidal ideation sometimes, but I just slipped out and I never wanted to say that to her. She tried to grab me while I was flailing and I shoved her away, which brings back trauma of a past relationship I had where it was mutually abusive and it ended terribly. She won't talk to me, I'm terrified she won't forgive me, and I probably deserve it.

554,mentalhealth,1,"Depression/stress is ruining my relationship and I need to change, but I don't know how I moved away from my home state just over a year ago to be with my girlfriend. We are 2+ years strong now, and have had multiple conversations planning out our future. We both have good jobs, and solid plans to excel in our fields. I have been planning to propose to her at the end of April; essentially putting together what she has described as her dream proposal. 

Well it seems that my profession has proven to take a higher toll on my mental health than I anticipated (EMS), and my already baseline abrasive demeanor has gotten worse; even when I don't notice it. I've dealt with aggressive bouts of depression even before moving, and I've found myself in an extensive depressive state for quite some time now. 

My girlfriend literally just made it known that she doesn't see me as the guy she fell in love with anymore, and hasn't for the past 5-6 months or so. Don't get me wrong, shes not talking about any time apart or separation. However, she has said shes disappointed with who i've shown myself to be. 

The thought of ever letting it get to this point makes me sick to my stomach, and ashamed doesn't even scratch the surface of how I feel. I want to get back to how it was in the beginning where I happily went full-blown romantic casanova with her.

Here's where I'm stuck: when I was at my peak Romeo phase, I was happy. I was energetic, excited, and creative with so much shit I did. Now, i'm miserable 24/7.

559,mentalhealth,1,"Feeling so low and stuck in a rut I've been feeling really in a rut these days. On weekdays I can function like a normal adult. I go to work, hang out with colleagues/friends etc. But when it comes to the weekends, I just can't get myself out of bed. The moment I wake up I just think to myself 'Fuck it's another day what the hell am I going to do.'  I can't get outta the bed and the only activity that I do is binge on videos or go on my phone. I mean if I made plans with friends I'd go out but it just seems like whenever I don't have any plans with others and I'm just by myself I can't muster the motivation to do anything and I feel so useless and powerless.

I know it's up to me to just get up and do stuff but at the same time it just feels so hard. It's like I'm in the drivers seat but I have my hands tied up at the back.

It's been going like this some time now and it's so hard to muster the urge or motivation to do anything - activities that I used to enjoy like hiking, reading, writing. 

FYI I do go to therapy regularly and I have mentioned this to my therapist. Anyone share a similar experience or have any tips on what I can do? :(",feeling low stuck rut feeling really rut day weekday function like normal adult work hang colleague friend come weekend just t bed moment wake just think fuck s day hell going t outta bed activity binge video phone mean plan friend d just like don t plan m just t muster motivation feel useless powerless know s just stuff time just feel hard s like m driver seat hand tied s going like time s hard muster urge motivation activity used enjoy like hiking reading writing fyi therapy regularly mentioned therapist share similar experience tip
560,mentalhealth,1,"When I was a kid I planned on killing myself in front of my parents. Hello. I was born into a family with a brother who was violently sexually abusive. It started when I was 4 and continued up until I was 13. At the same time I was abused by other pedophile who was not violent but still obviously abusive from the ages of 10 to 13. I told my parents about the second abuser and they put him in jail and rallied around me with total support. I told my parents about my brother who was 20 at this time now and they bullied me into lying to the police so that my brother wouldn’t get into trouble. It worked my brother got away with his crimes. I had been suicidally depressed since I was 7 and resented my parents for what they have done to me and for having put me in this situation to smile and be polite and nice to my brother during family events and holidays so they and he could pretend everything was okay. I hated them for what they had done to me and I hated life and wanted to die. So at 13 I made a plan to kill myself but to punish my parents by making them watch me die. That’s it. That’s all I had to say I guess.
I didn’t do it obviously I grew up and got away from my home. But I still think about it all the time and look back in horror in how awful my life was at the time that I even considered that.",kid planned killing parent hello born family brother violently sexually abusive started continued time abused pedophile violent obviously abusive age told parent second abuser jail rallied total support told parent brother time bullied lying police brother wouldn t trouble worked brother got away crime suicidally depressed resented parent having situation smile polite nice brother family event holiday pretend okay hated hated life wanted die plan kill punish parent making watch die s s say guess didn t obviously grew got away home think time look horror awful life time considered

I have given it enough time, suicide just seems kinda sexy at this point not gonna lie. The fucking stuff about finding ur passions is as fake as \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* (censored because people are complaining little bitches!) I found a passion alright but nobody wants me to do it! So thanks for nothing!

Watch me not die and my organs are fucked up, damn. Guess if I fuck em up once, a second time won't get too worse. Gotta lay my body somewhere nice so I'm missing for a bit, maybe get on the news. Attention sounds refreshing! My head feels like drinking water after having minty gum, it just don't feel right. 

I hate my girlfriend, my best friend! I hate my family! I don't have any bonds to them. My cat whom I care for dearly probably fucking hates me! At this point, thinking I just fulfill my ""passion"" then get killed, don't gotta do nothing myself plus it'll probably suffice for some cops wet dream to shoot someone and no penalty! Sounds great myself! Corruption is never good in places of power but can be beneficial sometimes.

Better not get locked up. I already feel shitty for any dime spent on me, I'll just escape or somethin then I'll attempt again. Everyone gives up! My only escapism method I gotta take a break from and man! Can't I just hug a cute girl then get my brains fucking blown out?

Imagine getting a girlfriend way out of your league who isn't your type just so you don't feel as fucking alone! WoW! Maybe that's a bit shitty of me.. no helping it now! Everyone acts all nice until they realize certain things! Sure! I drew the short end of the stick, almost every time! So what! Don't gotta call me that! 

How about you stitch your dirty mouth shut, you whore!

563,mentalhealth,1,"Decisions I have bad anxiety over making decisions that would involve other people. It gets worse when it involves people that I care about and people that I don’t want to lose in my life. I heard, read and know that if people leave you because of something (that isn’t necessarily bad or a deal breaker) then they weren’t  worth keeping in the first place but I still can’t wrap my head around that fact completely. Because if you make a decision, you made it. You chose what to do. You chose when to do it. You chose how to do it. Some factors may have been affected and it wasn’t all you but the thing is you still chose to do it. So if I chose to do something and picked the wrong timing and I lost that person (because they chose to leave me) then it’s my fault. It’s my fault that I couldn’t wait. It’s my fault that I couldn’t be patient enough to wait for the best time because my anxiety told me I needed answers. It makes me puke. It debilitates me. It makes me incapable of doing anything productive for the rest of the day because I’ve decided to either sleep it off or just stare off somewhere and let my anxiety sit on my chest because I’m too afraid it’ll follow me into my dreams and then there’s the possibility that I wouldn’t have control in that dream and I’m forced to have a sort of first hand experience with the consequences of my actions. It’s reached a point where it physically hurts me, and I’m hoping that it’s all just in my head and that it hasn’t really given me a physical sickness. My heart hurts too much to the point that I can’t breathe and I want to scratch it and stab it to make it go away. It makes me feel like I want to die, that I’d rather die because then I wouldn’t have to deal with this.

569,mentalhealth,1,"Just really feel like giving up for lots of reasons I've had some exceptionally  shitty things happen to me pretty much my entire life. Which have also lead to a lot of my mental health problems and addiction problems. Things were going fairly decent until November and I was hoping they kinda rebound but they just aren't. I'm stuck with the feeling (and it's fairly confirmed in my mind, it always has been tbh) That no one, not even my family really gives a shit about me. Been told most of my life how hated I am or how stupid I am or how much of an accident I was. I was abandoned when I was 8, with the justification that I was better off in that situation. Found out when I was 16 my father wasn't my father. Then been pretty much discarded by everyone and anyone once they've got what they need out of me or when I just can't handle the abuse.

I don't know how far away I am from a relapse but I don't see it too far off. I started drinking again a month and a half ago. Then I've been abusing my suboxone as well.

Feel stupidly alone, isolated and most off all just no one (including absolutely anyone in my family even the ones that say they are there when I need them) even care. Don't even have anyone to talk to and when I do. I either just get screamed at or told I'm not trying hard enough. When I've spent literally this entire year trying my ass off to get to a much better place and absolutely everything I thought was going well, has absolutely all fallen through because I can't afford help.

It really hurts knowing/feeling like you just have no one to turn to or absolutely anyone to reach out for help to.

573,mentalhealth,1,"(21M) Struggling With life Hi reddit i am a 21 year old male and over the past 5 Years I have stuggled With life to the point Where i just dont know what to do any more

It all started When i was around 15-16 When i stopped going out and Communicating with my Friends Due to my low confidence, Then as the years progressed it developed into depression and Lonliness

I hardly Have any friends now because they are too busy with thier own lives and ive also never had a Girlfriend So im not Experienced With women Which makes it hard for me To develop a Relationship. Im also an Introvert as well, Would say im shy but i struggle With making connections

Im currently at School Studying Engineering hoping to progress onto uni and Get a Degree in mechanical Engineering But over the past few years i just cant seem to stick at a Job long enough Cause i Either get Bored and leave or i End up getting laid off

Over the past year ive been really Trying to put myself out there and i would Try to start Conversations With random people but i just cant seem to make a Connection with people. I find it pretty hard to communicate with random people

I see Groups of Friends and Couples With each other happy all the time But i just Wish i had what they had. I wish i could feel what it feels like to wanted Or ""Loved""

This really Hurt but the other day i was sitting at a bar on my Own and as i was sitting there this old guy came up to me and starting speaking to me, He then Told me that he was a psychologist For over 20 years and then Told me That I was a ""Ticking Time bomb"" and to get help

I wasnt even Doing anything apart From just Drinking a beer by myself But he then said that he knew by my body language and Communication skills that i was Struggling with life

This ex-psychologist Also Told me that he had a brother once Who Had the same Traits as me and he said that One day his brother ended up unfortiantly taking his own life

Dont get me wrong, This guy (Cant remember his name) was a Good person and so was his wife that he introduced me to But What he said Shook me.

I also Got Bullied When i was in School but it pisses me Off seeing the people Who use to bully me With better lives than myself. 

I was So close to beating the shit out of this guy Who use to bully me in school the other day cause it pissed me off seeing him With a Girlfriend, I felt like he doesnt Deserve a woman or to Experience love

I dont Know, I plan on just working hard in School so that i can hopefully land a High paying Job cause at least money will give me some Power

At least with money i could Buy what i want, It would make me feel a bit more happy and i could also Buy myself Woman if i wanted to so that i dont spend the rest of my life alone

People say money doesnt bring happiness but i know for a fact that my life Would be better with an Extra few Hundred Thousand in the bank

I think having more money would solve Alot of my problems Because i just dont have that much to offer. Well according to IQ tests i did once im classed as ""Intelligant"" (apparently my IQ is Around 137) But  apart From that i dont have much To offer

im not that Funny, I Find it hard To Make connections, I cant Flirt with women, Im Quiet, Im pretty good looking and Tall but im not a model But i just dont think i have much to offer

578,mentalhealth,1,"Family always isn't everything Justifying yourself for the decisions you make to someone who was responsible for those decisions is a futile excercise. simply lost time. A patriarchal man using language like mei usko marta sali ko(If i see her I'd beat her) clearly was challenged by women power and couldn't do much about it. An unsettled story.

He says,he will never forget the day his own sister called the NGO on his father.  His own sister had to take help from unknown women because she couldn't trust her own family. Killing her every min of every hour and every day. Seems frevilous to me. But he will forget all the time his own sister was being tortured mentally physically emotionally while being a vitness he turned his head the other side so he could sit in the evenings with his parents to gossip and raise questions on his own sisters character or conduct. Family comes first isn't it. Ofcourse he also chooses to forget the day he beat his sister at the age of 24 because she challenged him to the extent that she had to get stiches. Pulling her by the hair and kicking with his feet and banging her head against the wall. But ofcourse family comes first. Saying i deserved it. And he wouldnt apologize. That seemed pretty forgettable as well. He says i caused stress and discomfort on the entire family. Nothing has been the same ever since. He tries to get information from me on the day of the incident about the people involved and who were those people but not on why i did what i did. To be honest i am not surprised i am simply tired of this cycle of the never stopping ""haunting of the hill house"". Is this a trick a game that would never end. He doesn't trust S***. Because he thinks he may have instigated me to take decisions of going against my family. He doesn't trust him but he surely does think its alright for a father to molest his own daughter. What i did was ""unforgivable"". My father looking at me staring dead in the eyes and saying i hate you tumse mujhe itni zada nafrat hai only when she is 22. Where he looks for reasons to hit her slaps her across her face. Anything from tying her hair to calling Eco instead of economics. Who really needs a reason anyway, right? You molest her but she is a slut and sadly she hasnt even had her first kiss. She comes home late from work and gets abused like she were being r**** mentally. The impact it leaves you is for life and will never be erased. While you are being abused because his day wouldn't end without it you just listen to him belittle you by calling you a whore and worse. No matter how hard you tried. Abuses you wouldn't give your worst enemy. Crying to sleep for months at a stretch with swollen eyes and soaked pillows making sure no one heard or youd be yelled for that too. Being to happy and joviel was a crime. Often shut down by words like don't act so smart. Staying a little longer each day at the bus stop to spend equally less time home. Sit in a park hopelessly so the yelling and abusing would reduce by a few more minutes. And this isnt even the worst of it. 

I have caused a lot of harm to these people by wanting to live my life. I have caused stress. 
He said dont meet those people you called the day you moved out. those people are a bad influence. Funnily i hadn't spoken to P*****i in ages and she still showed up. S**d is a father i never had. Gave me hope and support no one else ever would. Like i was his own daughter. Literally the person who gave me a purpose and made me feel loved and special. Who looked after me and dealt with the worst of me. These people are a bad influence on me. That i was worth it. That i was special. Sh**** my friend for life and my biggest support. She cried when i did. Treating me like a sister.

I am blessed to have them in my life.

I am not sure who i am after all of this. What am i if i was never allowed to be a normal human being loved by their parents.

582,mentalhealth,1,"Traumatic event with my neighbour left me feeling depressed I'm from England and I have suffered through some experiences along with some mental health difficulties. about a year and a half ago I was discharged from a psychiatric hospital into a supported living flat in the community. Trouble was - my next door neighbour was very abusive. She kept this up for a long time; calling me and anpther service user 'retards'. She assaulted the other guy and she threatened to bring her three brothers into my house. She would wake me up in the middle of the night by throwing things at my window (I lived on the ground floor). I.E A football etc etc. I rang the police instead of taking it out on her as I had just had a situation with safeguarding with my mother (nothing horrible but I didn't want to complicate anything in anyway - understandably). The police were very poor at their job each time just telling me to ignore her insults and threats. At some point they did decide to try charge her with 'a public order offence with hateful intent' but the police rang me about 6 months later and told me they had left it too long so they couldn't do anything. I hate to say it but I often fantasise about dishing out some revenge. I don't want to go into it so much as it's unnecessarily inappropriate but I fantasise often about breaking into her house; beating up her boyfriend and her and torturing them both. I come up with meticulously detailed plans involving ways to hurt them both. I don't want to kill them but I'm so angry I want to do something. My nurse thinks I could have PTSD and this ordeal definetly wouldn't have helped with that. Not just the woman but I have much less of a respect for the police now. It affects much more than just how I feel but also how I think. I have a completely different perception of crime now in ways I can't explain. But I'm not too confident that it's for the better.

I think of ending my life but recently I've been more swayed by anger - leading me to prefer the option of ruining theirs more than mine.

Positive note: I'm not going to do this. I'm a good person but I feel very hurt. I want to work with my nurse and I'm on a waiting list for CBT. I'm also a big fan of the bible. I'm not very religious but I believe it holds much wisdom and I can learn from it. I do think that if there is a god. I can have the worst life imaginable - one that could possibly mirror hell itself. But I know that if I do the right thing and stay true to what is good and holy then it won't matter in the slightest for I will join Jesus Christ in heaven come judgement day.

I guess all I want right now is a little sympathy. I will be honest and hold my hands high if that sounds like attention-seeking behaviour. But in my defence I in fact crave that relativity to my peers; I want to know I'm not alone.

Final point: It saddens me to see bad things happen in this world. So can I please ask a favoir from my fellow redditors?:
I believe that seeing sin and failing to act is in turn just as sinful. So please; I'd like to ask that if anyone sees something wrong. Don't stand idle.

586,mentalhealth,1,"Need help on what to do when an angry depressed friend snaps to you Before the story, I just want to state out some facts. 
1. Me and my friend has been friends for 10 years already. Since we're in early high school. 
2. I know about my friends depression because he told me that he had one. He has his meds as well. 
3. He also have Insomnia and he got meds for that as well. 
4. He once called me when I was at work, saying that he wants to kill someone, later kill himself because that certain someone made him pissed off. I cried instantly, begging him to not do that. He managed to  resolved that peacefully with that guy. Though with some damage to ahis neighbour's property. 


Ok so the story goes like this. I have a friend that is depressed. And easily get angry as well. So the story goes like this :

(Me and my friend loves to play video games together)
Last Thursday, my friend was expecting me to come over to his house and play some games and just hangout. But on that day, I got up pretty late as the day before I went to sleep at 6 in the morning. I woke up at a bit earlier before 2pm. He asked me what time I'll be coming at 1.45pm (I just woke up at this time) and I said to him that I'm still sleepy. And then after that he got a bit sad that I didn't come to his house on that day because I woke up later and he saw me playing game with another friend of mine on the night before, without inviting him to play together. I know he knows that I'm playing game without him because he could saw me online, and I didn't invite him. 

The next day, I asked him through whatsapp to come over to discord and have a chat(I'm sure everyone knows what this is), And he answered this : 
""I've been in a bad mood since yesterday, it's best if you don't talk to me for a while"" 
So I replied ""ok bro"" and did not message him anymore on that day. I thought that he is having a problem at home so I think its best for me to leave him alone. 

Moving forward to the next day (today), I greeted him and said ""Good evening sir"" ""Just checking up on you"". I didn't get a reply until it was 1.56 am, and he said why I used 'sir'. And he said that am I looking for a fight?  I said no, ""I'm not, boss"". I'm pretty sure that he snaps at that time, but he didn't say anything. I said I'm sorry if I have made him mad or anything. But he didn't reply afterwards. So I thought that everything was alright, and he didn't reply anything after that. 

Then my friend had snapped on me through whatsapp, where he messaged me at 4 in the morning, telling me that
""Not only are you stupid, insensitive, but you're fucking dense as fuck as well. No wonder your gf is often mad at you.""
(note that my gf and me always gets mad at me because I wake up late for quite some time). ""Please kill yourself"" is what he said to me later. Then I immediately apologise to him, and I said I don't want to get into a fight with him. I asked him, what I did wrong again. I asked him was it because I did not come to his house on last Thursday? He said partially. Then he said that me and his other friends are the same, saying everyone has forgotten him. I asked him again, what did I do wrong, because I don't know and I didn't want to Repeat doing it in the future. He said to me that to remember it myself. I really didn't know what I did wrong to him at that time. Later he said ""Do me a favour and cut yourself or something"" and I replied I don't want to. 

Then we got into quite an intense fight in the chat. He said that thanks to me and his other 'friends' that he got a headache till he cannot sleep. Then he said that I'm insensitive because I didn't think of his feelings on the day that I should go to his house because he was kinda excited for having me, but I didn't come to his house. He kept calling me insensitive a lot in his message.

He also got mad at me because when I play game, I did not invite him anymore. It's not like I don't want to invite him, but when he plays the game, even in a fun game mode, he gets super serious and when the game is not in our favor, he kept getting mad and it made the game not fun anymore with his rage. His rage made me felt very uncomfortable. 

Fast forward a few arguments later, I apologize to him, saying that I'm very sorry for what I did wrong, for all of my mistakes. But he relied with ""Go kill yourself"". I didn't know what I to reply, so I unconsciously typed ""Hm.."" and he said that ""what's that hm for you fkin insensitive piece of shit. This is a text chat, not a fkin role play chat""
""Seriously, fucking die""

That was the last of his message to me, at 5.10 am.


So that's the story. And I would really know on what to do, how should I reply to him, should I give him some time alone, or anything?
I really love him as a friend and I don't want our friendship to end just like this. I don't ever want to lose him like this.

592,mentalhealth,1,"Stupid me for thinking I could get one relatively good day with my mental health The day started off fine . I went into town and met up with a close friend and had a great time.  I managed to hold my s*** together untill about half an hour ago when I went into a complete meltdown because of my total lack of self esteem and acceptance of my appearance.  Even though I know my parents likely feel more upset than I do , I just want to feel loved by someone or something and I feel like that's the main reason I get so upset because at the moment I feel like no one genuinely cares for me because they actually care about me if you get what I mean.  I have never been in a relationship and I just generally feel so out of league with anyone I've had an attraction towards in the past as I feel like if I see an attractive guy that they must instantly be looking at me and thinking ""Christ you're ugly"" because decent looking guys don't go for fat/chubby, ugly girls-i have a huge fear that I am never going to experience how it feels to be involved in a loving, accepting relationship as all I feel I have felt up to this point is that other people always want more from me than I can give them. I also have a lot of painful memories from my time at college (I left in autumn 2017 as i couldn't cope with the pressure anymore and the implications it was taking on my mental health) , which mainly stemmed from just a general sense of inadequacy or competition between the other students in my group, particularly the other female students. In a way, I would love to lose all my memories from say 2011 onwards, give or take a few positive memories from concerts ive been to, because then I wouldn't have to keep revisiting then and hence making myself feel even more depressed. In terms of suicide , my parents constantly tell me that I am incapable of going about the inventory required to even attempt to take my own life. One side of my brain is telling me to prove them wrong by attempting to choke/strangle myself , but then the other side of my brain is trying to stay rational and telling me that I can't go yet because even though there's a high chance that everyone hates me , that if I kill myself now I won't ever get to see what I may achieve in the future.

594,mentalhealth,1,"My brother is losing his mind and I don't know what to do. My little brother (31) seems to be spiraling out of control. This all started as best  I can tell about 8 months ago when his marriage started to fall apart. He became very obsessive over what she was doing and started acting more and more erratic. My Mom stayed with him for a few days while he was really struggling and things got even more out of control, he ended up getting violent with her, the police were called and he wound up in the hospital for a few days. He had a girlfriend that he apparently had been having an affair of some kind with in town over Christmas. She was staying with him and he again became violent after not sleeping for several days. She ended up taking a $90 uber ride to my sisters house just to get away from him (after he finally fell asleep) on Christmas day. He ended up showing up at her house on Christmas and was talking in circles, didn't know what day it was etc. He recently lost his job after repeatedly blowing up on his coworkers. Now he is fixated on suing them. He never filed any FMLA paperwork even though we all urged him to do it because we saw this coming.

The last few days he has been posting all kinds of weird stuff on Facebook/Snap/Instagram, documenting every mundane thing that he does all day. His house is trashed and he just seems really unwell. He won't really listen to anyone in the family when we try to get him back on track. He is seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist but I question if he is even taking his meds at this point. I'm getting worried that he is going to snap and wind up in jail.

595,mentalhealth,1,"Fear of Success or just another asshole? So, I was recently confronted with hard truths. I had a great friend in my life that challenged me more than anyone else in my life to be a better version of myself. They called me out on most occasions for self-pity, self-sabotage, gaslighting, etc. I lost this friend the other day because I hurt them badly due to selfish, fear driven actions to be emotionally real. Most of the time I was completely unaware of what I was doing. I was insecure about believing them. I was insecure about myself and what they actually saw in me and how they felt about me. I had a lot of doubt in them and in myself, which caused much confusion for them.

I found that I have a fear of success. However, I have this fear I have narcissistic tendencies. Through years of being belittled, isolated, and viewed as awkward by peers, family, and those in authority over me I came to believe the lies others were telling me, I am not good enough. These lies are currently greatly ingrained in my truths to where I miss out and hurt others. So, instead of believing others I gaslit. Instead of believing I am good enough I live in self-pity, shame and doubt. I realized that I cannot go back in time and change the past, but to move forward and find healing for how I have hurt others. Also, to move forward in my own healing. I feel awful about what I’ve done.

Others thought they were the cause for how I treated them and my actions, but it wasn’t them it was me. I find myself disgusting for my actions. Now I fear this friend will never know the truth that it was me and not them. They’ve asked for space which, at first, I had a hard time respecting because I feared they would never return. So, instead of space I spent time inundating them with my thoughts, which was stupid and disrespectful and shows more sabotaging, selfish behavior. I have more respect for them to do that. I have done many stupid things. Now I have more fear because I am unsure they will ever comeback into my life. I want the best for them and currently that is not me. They were my best friend, the only person in my life, currently, who I believe cares enough to say something.

I feel lost and depressed. I have really worked on understanding myself, motivations, and intentions over the last few days. I’ve searched for the why and I’ve found some evidence, but awareness is not enough. I need to heal. I am NOT this person I have shown others, I don’t want to be this person. I don’t want to live in fear, fear torments and in my life I have tormented others. I start therapy next week to help me with healing and moving forward.

596,mentalhealth,1,"Dad snapped today I'm honestly not sure where else to post this, remove of this isn't allowed, but I honestly need to vent and need some advice.

Backstory: Admittedly I'm not the type of follow things to a T, my dad is a pastor of a youth group, and I'm in a leadership position in the group.


It started this morning, when he texted me saying we need to leave at 11:30. I had no idea what he was talking about, so I asked. Apparently during youth group he had said we are going to be playing touch football. This ended up leading to some back and forth that ended with him yelling at me and calling me lazy and a bunch of other things. I just ignored the messages and carried on.

About 5 minutes later and bursts into my room and starts yelling at me, and picks up my trash can, dumps my trash everywhere, and throws my trashcan leaving a dent, and tells me to ""pick this shit up"". I clean my room and decide to go to my study room to do some homework. He again bursts into the room and starts yelling at me saying if I don't pick up my study room ""there will be serious consequences"". I get to work on my study room when I hear him digging around in my bedroom. I go and see what he's doing, and he starts pointing out everything I missed, then yells at me for watching him leave.

I finish up what he asks, and it's peaceful for a few hours, when he again, bursts into my room. I'm just laying and reading, he shoves my bed and points out the trash underneath and says something along the lines of ""Do I need to tell you everything?"" He goes into my study room and starts throwing random shit around, I asks what he's doing and he says he's ""making the clutter more visible since I can't see it"". Be proceeds to grumble to himself saying I took advantage of him, because he was too soft. I turns and yells at me ""I'M PISSED"". His face is red, and I was afraid he might hit me. I just stay silent and move out of his way as he leaves. He just stands in the hallway, seemingly trying to stare me down, then just yells at me to get to work.

About another hour later, he comes into my room, saying he's going to the gym, and if he comes back and there hasn't been any serious effort made ""there will be consequences.

I'm afraid. Honestly, I don't know what's happened to him. I've been talking to my friends about him, and a couple say he was quieter than usual on Wednesday when we all saw him a lunch. As of now I'm just planning on A. Finishing everything up B. Leaving and spending the night at a friend's and C. Leaving the youth group.


If anyone has any advice or ideas I'm all ears. I'm seriously scared.

598,mentalhealth,1,"Realised my achievements aren't a source of happiness So this is my first time posting here and I am not sure if it belongs here but here it goes. So for almost 2 years I have been dealing with all kinds of sh*t; constant academic failure, emotional abuse (this has been a constant companion since my childhood), spiraling up in my own insecurities. All of this has just left me with  negative thoughts in my head and feeling alone all the time. I guess I have friends who'd care about me but I never really believe them (always been dealing with trust and abandonment issues). 



So in the later part of 2019 I decided to start with therapy and initially it went really well and I explained to them how I was expecting my results of the exam that I was constantly reappearing since 2 years and failing again and again.

 
2 days ago I got my results and I PASSED. 

I used to think that  probably my constant academic failure is creating problems for me and untill and unless I don't get out of this vicious cycle, I won't get any better. I always thought when I clear the exam I'd be so extremely thrilled and finally be happy after a long time of grief, anxiety and loneliness.

And yet here I am with the positive results and still don't feel a thing. I thought I'd be happier, life will change, things will start sorting out and yet I feel as if with every day passing, I'm drowning even further. I cannot seem to figure out what exactly it is.
 Maybe I need a better perspective?
Maybe I need better professional help? Or maybe I just need to stop overthinking.
I'm worried all consuming anxiety is gonna kick back again and it's gonna be all the same 2019 repeating itself. I'm not sure what I'm expecting 
I expected myself to be happy and yet here I am just lost and feel like curling up in bed all day and speak with noone forever. I have this constant feeling that maybe things got better but still something is lacking.

I asked her if she was alright and she shook her head up and down as in ""yes"" and then I said that we could talk later if she wanted and she just nodded. What should I do now? Can anyone help?

601,mentalhealth,1,"Is it worth it to tell my dad I think he has a social disorder? I'm 20, my dad is almost 60. Over the past few years I have become much more aware of my dad's behaviour, I think just because I'm getting older. I actually think he might have OCD or Asperger's but I am nowhere near qualified to be giving anyone a diagnosis. I won't get into the reasons why I think that, but my mom (recently divorced from my father) and I have identified so many possible symptoms of Asperger's or OCD. I love my dad, and he does so much for my brother and I. 

The main problem is just that our relationship with him is so confrontational. There are a lot of good moments but almost daily there will be a huge argument or behaviour that is simply inappropriate. It hurts him more than it hurts me, because most of the time I'm able to maintain my composure and see most of what he is saying as irrational. I don't mean to sound so self-righteous, it's possible that I could be entirely wrong. Not only this, but my dad is extremely isolated and my brother and I are all he has. We will be moving out soon and then he will be totally alone. He has let almost every relationship in his life get away from him, or he has destroyed them by being so harsh and opinionated. I would really like him to see a therapist just to talk about all the emotions he has and how much he keeps inside due to being so socially isolated. 

I think I could get him to see a therapist if I told him I was simply concerned that he was sad and anxious and upset and it would mean a lot to me. But should I bring up some of the behaviours he engages in that I don't see as ""neurotypical""? Of course I have no idea if he actually has a social disorder or mental illness so I would never say that to him. He is almost 60 and I have no idea how it would feel to get a diagnosis for something he has probably had all his life. Or how it would feel for his own daughter to be the one to bring it up. Should I tell him I'm concerned about these patterns of behaviour? Would that hurt him more than it would help him?

604,mentalhealth,1,"My friends are overwhelming me. LONG! So, I have never been diagnosed with any mental illness or disorder, but I have a history of mood disorders in my family. I’ve had a few bouts of depression in my life and I think I might be struggling with some disordered eating patterns, but this post isn’t about my mental health. It’s about my friends. At this point in my life I’m so very happy that I’ve found the best friends that I have, they support me, they love me for who I am, and I love them too. They are honestly one of the biggest joys that I have in my life and I couldn’t be more grateful to have them near me. However... there’s been a problem. I’ve always known my best friend, let’s call her MC, always had anxiety. She overthinks everything, everything always has to be a crisis all the time, and she gets panic attacks. It’s like, clinical anxiety that just hadn’t been diagnosed yet.  She and I became best friends over the course of a few years, and I love her to death and would do anything for her. I’ve even offered to let her move in with me because her “home” is too triggering for her. Recently, in the last year, we’ve met another girl. Lets call her GH. I didn’t know GH that well, and so when I started hanging out with her and the rest of our group, I was shocked and taken aback when she started having pretty violent panic attacks in front of all of us. While she’s recently started medication and therapy, it’s still pretty frequent and is accompanied by various mood swings, erratic behavior, etc. I really love her company and appreciate her as a human being, but things have just gotten so bad with my friends lately, I needed to vent about it. In November, GH and MC accidentally triggers panic attacks in each other. It was horrible, and literally the worst circumstances you could imagine. I found GH curled up in a ball, hiding from everyone and hyperventilating. I had to stay with her for a few hours as she kept spiraling into more states of panic, eventually ending up in her car, where she screamed and cried and violently expressed all of her inner thoughts and spiraling anxiety. I was all alone, and she was my ride. I couldn’t get out, there was no way to escape the absolute sword fight coming out of her mouth. I wanted to be there with her to help her, and I knew that it was best for someone to be there with her and that she needed it, but at the same time, it was just so scarring. I hated hearing her scream about how everyone hated her and how she just wants to die, etc. etc. she finally calmed down after about an hour of this. I’ve been nervous around her ever since, and I get uncomfortable when I’m in enclosed spaces with angry or upset people. I wanted to be there for my friend, but I couldn’t handle it. Now, as MC is dealing more and more with her anxiety issues and telling me about her panic attacks and triggers and begins to have spiraling thoughts in front of me I start getting so overwhelmed and I don’t want to be near her anymore. I know you’re supposed to be honest with your best friends, but how the hell am I supposed to tell my best friend in the whole world that her anxiety overwhelms me? She’ll internalize it and never want to open up to anyone ever again. I hate being around my friends because all they talk about is their mental illnesses and it’s so overwhelming to me, it’s no longer enjoyable to be near them. I’m so sorry for the long post, I just can’t tell anyone this in real life.

607,mentalhealth,1,"How do I help my brother? My 38 year old sibling was diagnosed with LD, ADD, speech problems and allergies as a kid. My parents didn't like what Ritalin did to him, so they stopped giving it to him after 1 week. So growing up he did not take any medication. He has struggled in school, at home and work and with his weight. I believe he has an undiagnosed condition, but I don't know what type of doctor to go to for a diagnosis. 
He is morbidly obese.  He is under 5’8” and well over 320 pounds.  He is a compulsive eater, and will eat combinations of food other people simply wouldn’t think of, such as spaghetti with mayonnaise (an entire large jar of mayonnaise at that) or just plain hot dog buns.  All of this has led to a number of serious health problems, including sudden onset diabetes, which he was diagnosed with in December 2018, and severe sleep apnea.  These very serious health issues, which are dangerous and scary by themselves, are made much worse by his behavioral issues.  In fact, his diabetes diagnosis was only arrived at because there was a perfect storm of his poor health and behavioral problems.
He refuses to wear pants and prefers the cold, so during the winter he will go and sit on the porch in shorts and a tee shirt and watch videos on his phone regardless of the temperature.  He simply does not seem to feel the cold, and if he does he simply does not care.  This leads to dry skin (in addition to a chronic cough). When he gets dry skin, he picks at it compulsively which means his legs are always scabbed or bruised.  It seems like he can't tell when he has pain.  Last December, he picked at his leg and ultimately wound up with an infection.  He didn’t tell anyone about the infection until the skin was literally bubbling and oozing.  By the time he brought it to my attention (he hid it from our mom) he had a bubble the size of a golf ball by his ankle and was oozing puss to the point where there was a trail where he walked.  My sister and I insisted he go to the hospital, and when we got there he was immediately admitted (he stayed in a hospital bed for 10 days). 
While at the hospital they asked him his pain level on a scale of 1-10.  He calmly said it was a 2.  The Doctors did not believe that (so much so that they gave him Fentanyl).  After they administered the antibiotics via IV they ran blood work and diagnosed him with diabetes and informed him he was lucky to have his leg. 
Shortly after getting out of the hospital, he got an infection in his eye (cellulitis) and, after seeing an opthamologist  we were told to go straight to the ER.  He was then transferred to two different hospitals (via ambulance) because each hospital was so worried there would need to be an emergency surgery that could perhaps involve removing his eye. Once again when he was asked about his pain level he said it was a 2, and once again the doctor said he should've been in a lot more pain and administered Fetanyl. Ultimately he recovered, though the extent of the damage to his eye is still unknown.
Both times he told people that his leg or eye had looked the way it did for only a couple of days, which was impossible. His leg had been untreated for a month before anyone in the family was aware of it and rushed him to the hospital and his eye had been untreated for a week before we noticed it and rushed him to the hospital. After both of the incidents we decided to start going to his doctor appointments with him. At his appointments he said he was fine, nothing bothered him and answered questions with one word answers (the same way he responds to us). 
His health problems continue, and we once again had to take him to the hospital because of an open wound on his leg (roughly one year after he was first rushed to the ER with bubbling/oozing wounds).  They are simply made worse by his attitude/behavioral issues.  He lies to doctors, his family, and himself about his health. He is very stubborn and will do things out of spite. You can show him proof that he is wrong and he will simply deny it without offering any counterpoint. He will be sick and refuse to go to the doctor; if you ask him to do a chore he will leave and come back late at night so he doesn't have to do it; if you give him a date by which he needs to have a chore completed he will wait until an 11 PM of that date to start doing it (if he even does it all). If you talk to him about something he doesn't like (chores, doctors, weight, health, his eating, etc.) he will just ignore you and doesn't respond to you. When he is not working (he works as a cashier and is on his feet most of the day - despite doctor's orders that he limit the time spent on his feet until he loses weight) he just sits and watches tv (which, admittedly, he has done his whole life).
He also struggles socially.  While he is a very sweet and generous person he has struggled to find his place, and simply retreats into himself.  He goes to the movies by himself a few days a week. At any given time he has seen almost every movie in the theater (some of them twice). He has never had a girlfriend and has never had many friends. 
Additionally, he has “quirks” that may be indicative of something more serious. He has motor and vocal tics - blinks his eyes multiple times, twitches/shakes his head/neck, jerks his mouth/lips, and makes a spitting/hissing noise with his tongue against his teeth.  In addition to his compulsive eating, he seems to have other compulsions such as picking his skin until he bleeds, washing his hands with scalding hot water, checking and rechecking things (like closing doors), touching things.  If his clothes are in the dryer and you move them, he will wash them again. He also hoards and keeps things that most people would get rid of immediately.  He doesn't clean his room or car and refuses to allow anyone to. 
He also falls asleep when he is driving (he has been in many car accidents because of this). When he is not driving, he falls asleep every car ride within minutes. When he was left in charge of taking care of my parents cars that are in the garage, he would have to start them every few days so that the battery wouldn't die. He would start the cars in the closed garage and leave them running for a couple of hours nearly killing himself and me. When he was told he could not do that he got upset and just ignored me. The next time he did it he cracked the garage door, but did not realize it wasn’t opened above the exhaust pipe, and once again filled the garage and house with exhaust. I told him he could not do that, he had to open the garage fully and/ or take them out of the garage. He still refuses and I have to go out there and open the garage door. He has left the air compressor running all day nearly blowing up the house.  He refuses to help out around the house or follow any of the rules set for him (clean his room/bathroom). 
He has run up $20,000 credit card debt, 95% of it on food. He has no savings or any money. He lives pay-check to pay-check and everything else my mom takes care of. He lives with my mom. I do not believe he will ever be able to live on his own. We have tried antidepressants and nothing changed. Not too long ago I asked him about his future and he said he was going to get married and have kids one day. He is 38 and has never had a girlfriend or done anything that would lead to him one day getting married or having kids.  
Obviously, there are a lot of issues/problems.  I love my brother and want him to live the best life he possibly can, but when I look at everything that is going on and everything that has happened, I know that he will not be able to until he receives the proper care, which begins with a proper diagnosis. He does not think he has a problem, and would be heartbroken if he knew how apparent it is to those around him that he needs help.

609,mentalhealth,1,"Panic disorder and no clue what to do Hey!

Im a male in my 20s from sweden diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. I have been in touch with psychiatrists  that says i need CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy i think?) but the queue to even get there is 6 months and i can't afford to go to a private psychiatrist.

I know my panic disorder and anxiety is based on me being scared of ""going crazy"" or ""insane"" and everything that makes me think about something irregular or weird triggers panic attacks and anxiety even tho i know very well that im ""fine"". Every time that i distract myself being with friends or having fun in general i feel great. But every time i feel great i also wonder like ""do i really feel great or am i going to feel bad soon?"" which of course makes me feel anxious and depressed.

The doctors i have talked to asked if i wanted anti-depressant but i already take medicine for epilepsia which have side-effects of their own and im scared anti-depressants will make me feel bad in another way.

I just want to throw myself out here in this subreddit and ask for some kind of guidance and to see if anyone understands what im going through. My friends and family are VERY supportive but nobody really understands how it feels. The only time im happy is when im somehow distract myself from this negative thinkingcurve. I eat pretty healthy and exercise regularly, should i just ""wait it out"" or ""power through""? 

I guess im just venting and looking for someone to guide me in the right direction, or any tips at all.

613,mentalhealth,1,"Ive started cutting myself again, after 5 years. Hi there folks, I was wondering if i could ask for some help. You see, i used to cut myself a lot when i was younger (around 11-16 years old) because i had depression and didn't know how to deal with it. I've been on a variety of different meds since i was 13, and those help. When i turned 16 i stopped, and when i turned 17 i started getting tattoos to fill the void that was left from cutting. I don't think im suicidal, i have not felt that low for a good wee while.

So that's a wee bit of background for you.

A few weeks ago, i got low again. I think it might have been just before xmas. But i didn't turn to cutting straight away, but i also didn't tell anyone. When i first went to do it, i just cried and didn't do it. But then 2 weeks ago i started. I'm cutting my upper leg, because then no one will know. I have my first appointment with a psychologist in a week, my first appointment since i was 15.

So my question is this, is it okay to feel the way that i do? Like, is it okay to want to do it and feel awful and good about it? 

I'm sorry for bringing this here, i just don't want to hurt my family again.

I have suffered major depressive episodes on and off since high school. The longest, continuous one was from September to October of last year. A constant two months of a horrible depressive slump. I binged food, I couldn't shower or do any chores, I fell behind in school work, I isolated myself, I considered stepping out in front of a car multiple times, it was just awful. But now that slump is over and I'm feeling relatively normal again. I have my first ever meeting with a psychiatrist this upcoming Tuesday and hope to finally be officially diagnosed. But I am terrified that I will walk in there appearing to be fine and that he'll dismiss me just like every other counselor or doctor I've talked to has just because I seem fine in the moment and ""manage"" well enough.

615,mentalhealth,1,"Solitude brings solace. Isolation is peace Ever wondered what Lucifer feels like? Of course not. You think hes the worst thing to ever exist. There is something far worse though, the masses who'd ignorantly condemn one with only hearing a biased story from one source. 

Ever consider Atlus' plight? To carry the weight of earth upon his back? Of course not. The story tells you he was a fool but does not point out his willingness to help another.

Ever consider what the earth feels like? No. You tread upon it, spit on it, dump your garbage on it. Cutting off its limbs and scorching its face for profit. You do not consider the earth sustains your very existence.

There is an opposite to all things but you dont care. 

Ever considered the plight of the next man? No. You care only for self and what can be done for you. You scoff at any you think is less financially stable than you, anyone you think is of lesser intelligence you deem worthless,  but you never look in the mirror.

A dandelion is called a weed yet a rose is called beauty.  Your populace you call civilization yet uncivilized as a whole you live in a torrent of chaotic deeds.

620,mentalhealth,1,"I'm going to break if nothing changes for the better soon. My life hasn't been going the way I'd imagined for a year now. I am stuck in a country where I can't work, with someone who takes all of the money I try to save up to get a work visa or more recently, a phone, and spends it on beer or other unnecessary things. If we needed rent money, I'd get that. But that's not what's going on. 

Anyway, I'm at wits end lately and this morning is one more straw on my invisible camel's back and I can see the poor thing about to invert entirely where the hump used to be. ""If you don't clean this up I'm going to throw it away,"" is probably the worst thing you can say to someone that doesn't have much of anything anymore. I haven't been able to buy new socks or underwear for a year now, and when the animals that live in the same house as you have a knack for destroying all of your belongings because you haven't lived with dogs or cats in over ten years and don't know what they'll get into (the cats destroyed my discount bag of bread and ate the toppings off my pizza??? But left my wife's alone because she just eats cheese.. Its never been an issue in the past, probably because we never get toppings because it's expensive or I'd have put the pizza in the oven) and before you convinced the person you live with to crate their animals at night, they destroyed plenty of your clothes but hey.. Its your fault for not putting them elsewhere and you know it... 

But there's very few places the animals can't get to and if you try to use one of the spare rooms to protect your stuff, you get accused of trying to take it over for yourself.. I just. I can't believe someone would threaten to throw your shit away when they know you lost everything to be with them and when you barely have enough belongings to fill a BACKPACK, it hurts. All because you stupidly said that if they weren't going to clean up things that have been in the same messy pile for months into a bag and put away instead of stepping in cat puke because you didn't notice it in the pile of clothes you had to step on to get to something. I dunno. I know I'm far from perfect, I've always been annoying, but now I'm self loathing and know I've ruined my life for a relationship that doesn't seem to be getting better.

621,mentalhealth,1,"I feel so empty now One of the things I don't do is trust people or let my guard down. It takes me a long time to do so and takes a lot of effort from people to get me to do that. I was friend with benefits with some and although I did have underlying feelings for them I had myself under control, so that I wouldn't care for them too much or love them. I kept it at the distance it was meant to be kept at, with the occasional help here and there if they asked for it. I would never ask for help either mind you. The person had once broken their phone and since they lived in the same building as me came to me for help and stayed with me for 2 days in which we became close and would even say good friends where we would talk about personal things in our lives. But even then I kept myself under control. But during Christmas they messaged me to check up on me and i felt the convo was becoming too close so I stopped responding and on New Years Eve they messaged me telling me that they have started to like me and want to be with me and see me in their future. Told me about the littlest things that they appreciated about me and how they don't understand why I was still single. I told them I was happy that they've told me this but that I was scared of being broken as I had just recently (5 months ago) gotten out of a terrible relationship and my heart was not ready to love another again. They said it's fine that I can take my time and that they weren't sure of a relationship but that we should try. And that they wouldn't hurt me ever. Fast forward now. It went from looking after me everyday asking if I was okay and making sure i slept well (because I don't sleep well and have nightmares from time to time) by being on the phone with me all night. To them now telling me that they've changed their mind and that we should just be friends. Even tho I didn't want this from the beginning. Am I wrong to say that this person is very unfair and that they made me open up to them and trust them only for them to break that trust in less than a few weeks of us trying this? It took 18 days for them to back track. I only trusted them because we were good friends from before, but hadn't seen this side to them. Now I feel super empty and I feel like I can never trust anyone even if they give me their word. I feel awful because before this happened I was in a happy place and a place where I was gently healing myself, only for this person to come along and break that peace.

622,mentalhealth,1,"worried im too reliant on fiction/media for context: i (22) have depression/anxiety and am currently waiting to talk to a specialist about potential aspergers and/or adhd.

most of the time i feel like i NEED to be engaging in content at all times. like right now i am also listening to a youtube video in another tab, but thats just the tip of the iceberg. i almost never do anything without also distracting myself with at least one video/podcast at the same time. and whats more, generally its the same stuff ive seen/heard before, and im barely paying attention to it, i just feel like i need it.

i guess this is something rooted in attention issues, but thats not my whole concern. its also the extent to which i rely on this stuff emotionally. like, i often feel very bad anxiety and cant focus, and in those times the only way i  can think of to help is to rewatch some youtube video. i rarely engage in anything new because so much of my media consumption is based around comforting myself, so trying new things makes me feel anxious. i practically had an anxiety attack in the cinema the other day just because the film i was watching (rated suitable for all ages btw) was unfamiliar and made me nervous. i watched a new tv show recently and it also caused me to feel extremely anxious for the same reason..engaging in new characters and ideas is just so exhausting and anxiety inducing. plus, if i start relating or caring for a character a lot and something bad happens to them or they turn bad, it affects me a stupid amount emotionally and can make me feel awful. so i always just go back to the same safe stuff that i half listen to and gain nothing from. my family think i am strange and childish (fair enough).  im never trying anything new or trying to focus on whatever is causing me to feel bad, i just want comfort and distraction. even when i rely on rewatching stuff when im feeling anxious, it doesnt always help, but its all i feel able to do. 

plus, i also have a tendency to daydream a lot. its like, i have characters and narratives in my head, who ive had in my head since i was like, 8. i often cant focus on other media or tasks because im thinking about them. i dont know how unhealthy this is, i just know it seems kind of weird, and i dont know if i should be trying to detach myself from it, but that idea scares me. 

i also am kind of obsessed with one main piece of media and have been since i was 15, and a lot of my creativity and friendships especially online are based around it. i wonder if i take that to an unhealthy level too. 

should i be trying to detach myself from these habits? does anyone else do them? i know focusing on one thing properly is advised in cognitive behavioural therapy (or it as to me) and is viewed as a good thing, but sometimes when i try, it feels like ive left myself vulnerable to bad feelings by not filling my head with safe content as a buffer.

If not, please let me know and I will remove it. 


Over the Summer/Autumn, I (37M) tried to end my life twice as a result of a relationship breakdown and other issues I do not really want to go into too far; not the first time, hopefully the last though. As a result of one attempt, I have some marks/slight scarring on my left wrist. I am currently in the early stages of returning to work as a shop manager. The shop I work in requires that I often give close demonstrations of products to customers over a period of about 15 minutes, often to teenaged people. Currently I am able to wear longer sleeves so it's not an issue, however as weather warms up, I will be wearing shorter sleeves and, whilst I am fairly open with personal friends about what happened, I would rather not spend time answering the ""Hey what did you do to your arm?"" questions from customers or colleagues as I just get on with my life. 


I am wondering if anyone had any advice on ways I could cover this up. I tried a watch, but am not really a fan, preferring it on the other arm. I was thinking about using a bracelet or quantity of these to cover it but have NO fashion experience, or knowledge of what might work. Ideally I am looking for stuff that's not too masculine or feminine that would work, though I do not normally wear jewelry of any kind (other than glasses), so am a little out of my depth.

632,mentalhealth,1,The concept of Britain get talking is flawed at its foundation For those that are unaware there is an ongoing ad campaign in the UK called Britain get talking. The aim of Britain get talking is to get teenagers and youth (at one point it was specifically aimed at men) in order to talk out loud about their struggles during the ad break. My issue with the campaign isn’t actually the ads themselves however once someone has spoken to their family they (most likely) will go to the NHS. - again I’m talking specifically about men for this next part - This is where I - and hopefully you - see the first major flaw and problem with this ad campaign. In Britain currently it is estimated that 1 in 8 men are currently struggling from depression (side note if anyone wants sources I can send them down below) suicide is also now the largest killer of men under 50 GLOBALLY. So the issue I’m raising is once you’ve reached the stage of going to the NHS why is it that out of  those men who already have spoken to their family are then rejected and reduced to nothing by the 36% acceptance rate for them in the NHS? This is the issue I’m raising that what is the point of the ads if they can’t actually get help for it - I’ve created a petition on change and if you could spend just a few extra seconds to sign it that would be much appreciated [Petition ](http://chng.it/kdKytM96fz),concept britain talking flawed foundation unaware ongoing ad campaign uk called britain talking aim britain talking teenager youth point specifically aimed men order talk loud struggle ad break issue campaign isn t actually ad spoken family likely nh m talking specifically men hopefully major flaw problem ad campaign britain currently estimated men currently struggling depression note want source send suicide largest killer men globally issue m raising reached stage going nh men spoken family rejected reduced acceptance rate nh issue m raising point ad t actually help created petition change spend just extra second sign appreciated petition chng kdkytm fz

646,mentalhealth,1,"Life's got too much and I'm at the end of my rope. I (21, F) moved to uni a few years ago, and whilst I needed to get away from my hometown, the new place has just thrown up other issues that are slowly driving me insane.

I wasn't sure about coming to uni in the first place; I had no idea what I wanted to do afterwards, so had no indication of what course to do. I eventually picked English as it was my best subject. I hate it. The teaching is sub-par at best, and I have no motivation to either go in or complete the work. I had two hefty deadlines due last week that I had to have extended, and I still haven't worked on them. I open my laptop and stare for hours on end, usually crying periodically when my brain wakes up and realises what I'm doing (or not doing).

My dad can't afford to (/chooses not to) help out financially, and my student finance just keeps going down. My boyfriend has a chronic health condition and mental health issues that make it difficult for him to find work. We live together, and therefore a lot of the costs fall on me. I have no money to treat myself or go out whenever I want to, as we have to budget quite strictly in order to eat.

We live in a house shared with four other people, we have the loft space. The house is a lot for rent, and we don't get much for it. There always seems to be something going wrong and we're always contacting the landlord. Over the past few months, I have barely left the house, confining myself to my room, or my boyfriend's. I've had health issues that have knocked me down so much and my anxiety and depression seem to have increased tenfold. I've struggled with my eating for a few years now, and it keeps getting worse. All this has made me irritable and snappy towards my boyfriend. He does everything he can to make me feel loved and all I seem to be able to do is snap. I am trying to be better, but I hate how I've become. My mental health is not an excuse.

I have about 5 months of uni left, then I'm finally finished. But these five months just feel like they're going to be a continuation of the stagnation my life has become. I have finally figured out what I'd like to do after uni, and English is no part of it. I see no point in putting any effort into the degree any more, but I can't move forward with what I want to be doing until uni is finished.

I recently applied for a bunch of jobs in the city, stressed by the lack of money. But now I've had one rejection and a minute to think, I'm not sure I'd cope with a job alongside uni. It would totally override uni and make it even more impossible for me to get work done.

I just want to skip forward a few years, to living in a cosy little home we love, being financially stable once more, to being settled and happy with my boyfriend, a kid or two, and all the pets we keep talking about.

But I'm stuck. Stuck in this constant cycle of waking up, eating barely one meal a day, stressing about all the work I have no motivation to do, wanting to hide myself from my boyfriend because I don't want to make him miserable with my depression-fueled irritability. I have no idea what to do. I have no idea how to get through these next few months. I am at the end of my rope and I can't stand it.

I lost my mum when I was 4, and somehow I think if she was still around I'd be in a much better place.

If anyone has any advice on how to cope through the next few months til I can actually start my life, I would love to hear it.

652,mentalhealth,1,"I really need some feedback on something I uncovered I did 20 years ago. I am in turmoil. I am following a spiritual path as I have always been unhappy and was/am a binge eater and had various substance abuse problems.

I believe my father was emotionally unavailable and my mother was quite submissive, holding the peace in the family.

From my home life I developed a lot of worthlessness, self esteem issues etc (my dad basically passed these on).

Anyway...

I recently started really going into my self and trying to find out just what was making me tick, what am I, and the nature of my being.

I began finding out a lot. Negative traits here and there and also experienced a lot of blissful feelings, oneness and peace (for the first time ever).

With the work I've been doing I went straight to an event I know has been lurking in my mind for a long time.

The event was my first 'sexual' experience with my brother at around age 11-12. We would touch and jerk each others penises a bit, mostly with boxers on. Poke each other in the bum with boxers on and he also gave me oral sex with my boxers on.

My brother was 2 years older than me and this was entirely consensual from both sides.

The sexual bit was in apostrophes as it didn't really feel arousing. Overall it just felt like exploration and curiosity.

Lol so anyway that was an event that always lurked around and resurfaced from time to time but I thought I had already dealt with it.

Going even deeper into my self I found something worse which I had never really brought into my awareness before other than just kind of thinking of it as curiosity.

Around the same time or a year after, I was playing with my cousins (all were younger than me) as we normally would. For some reason I touched my cousin's clothed backside and sort of grabbed it.

I don't know why I did this. It seemed to come out of nowhere. I believe it was just curiosity. I never really thought about it again or did anything like it again.

20 years on this all resurfaces.

I don't want to make myself out like a victim but I have been going through pure hell working through all of this. So many layers of emotions coming and going. Suicidal thoughts have been pondering but I don't think I would actually act. I feel as though I do have hope as a human being. Albeit this is difficult to accept.

I am finally beginning to accept what I did but I just don't know where I stand.

I have only ever been attracted to females of a similar age to myself.

Do I tell my family? I don't think this is a good idea. It will cause unnecessary pain and confusion. Surely?

I don't think this has affected my cousin's life but still I abused my position of power essentially.

Looking at this from a shadow perspective; I have always done certain things that showed a complete lack of care for other people, albeit nothing like this, however things such as keeping quiet occasionally when things are to be paid for as a group, eating more than my fair share when sharing meals with people, completely ignoring people I go out with to talk to some stranger, pulling my good friend off a swing so he landed on his face. These might sound pale in comparison but there have been many more events like this.

If anyone can just give me their opinion it would really help. I am in complete turmoil. Dreams of drowning. Constant headaches. I am reaching out to therapists, forums just to have this out in the open. How do I actually integrate this experience into my character and move forward as a 'whole' person? It seems somewhat unforgivable. There must have been some form of attraction for me to grab my cousin's backside but really I see it as curiosity, and the shadow acting out. This has been deeply repressed and never faced seriously. I was working on my self so much, in an effort to help others in the future but now it feels as though there is no coming back. How can I help others if I can't be honest with myself and others? Ie, it feels as though I would need to explain this to people that want to know me well in the future.

Seems very tricky but I know it is still early days. I have been crying a lot and my body is in constant pain. Either way I am wanting to face this head on and figure everything out.

660,mentalhealth,1,"What are your thoughts on an end-to-end online therapy platform? Hi all,

I'm a product manager based in San Francisco, and I've been supporting my partner as she struggles with depression and anxiety for several years now. In hopes of starting a new personal project, I've been looking for potential ways to help make mental health treatment more accessible. I would really appreciate your feedback on my ideas so far.

From my research, more than half of people with mental health illnesses are not getting help - even people who have health insurance.

There seem to be two major barriers that cause this:

1. There is a shortage of available and affordable care providers
   1. 51% of counties in the US have zero psychiatrists
   2. 40% of psychiatrists don’t take insurance
2. Getting insurance coverage very difficult
   1. Therapist directories are out often of date (those provided by insurance carriers)
   2. Mental health claims are rejected 2X more often as physical health claims
   3. The appeal process is too complicated for most patients to complete

I think there might be an opportunity to eliminate these barriers by providing an end-to-end online therapy solution, primarily based on video. That is, a marketplace for patients to quickly connect with their ideal therapist and book video-based therapy sessions that are covered by insurance.

1. Value proposition for patients:
   1. Faster access to therapists that match their requirements and are available due to a significantly wider selection, as patients are unconstrained by geographic location (statewide).
   2. More therapists accepting insurance since they will be provided tools to easily process insurance claims on their behalf

I am looking for any kind of feedback, tips, stories and opinions from anyone who's interested in the mental health space. It would be really helpful if you told me a little about your background (e.g. are you going to therapy, are you thinking of starting therapy, have you tried online therapy before...). If you are curious to see a prototype, I can show it to you via DM.

662,mentalhealth,1,"Do I have a bad memory? I’m new to reddit and am not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this, so apologies if this isn’t the place for this. 

I recently got together with a group of friends from high school and, over drinks, the old days were the primary topic of discussion. I’m not sure if these guys have superhuman memories or if mine may be deficient. So many vividly recalled stories, many of which I had no recollection of(many of the stories involved me or were about something we’d done when we were young and wild). People were mentioned that I had no memory of. 
It’s not like I have no memories from that time, and there were lots of things that I did remember once they were mentioned. But it’s fair to say that I remembered much less than anyone else. 
One story in particular involved me stepping in to defend someone who was being bullied and standing up to an older, bigger kid after football practice and as the situation escalated I had to be restrained from getting into a fight. 
My friend is like, you don’t remember that??
I don’t. 
Seems like something that a person would remember right?

I’m now 40 years old and am a former college football player. I was never knocked unconscious while playing, but have learned in recent years that you don’t always lose consciousness when you are concussed. I played linebacker and there were many times when I’ve “had my bell rung” and have seen spots in my vision etc. My dad, who is now 71, played linebacker in the NFL for years and in the past year has been diagnosed with dementia and it’s likely that he has CTE. (He’s being evaluated by the NFL doctors and is part of the class-action suit against the NFL.)
Obviously this has heightened my awareness of memory lately. 

I’m not a person who spends a lot of time in the past, and I know that high school for many people is the best time of their life(not me. Not that it was bad.it was fine)and for this reason many of their best and most vivid memories are from this period. My friend with the most stories has a nearly photographic memory of those days, but I’m also pretty sure he’d say that was the best time of his life.  Meanwhile, I don’t really even remember my teachers from school save for a few(I would recognize them if I saw them) but I’m awful with names. 

I’m wondering if anyone can relate to this(how can you not remember that??)

I get paid to do what I love. On the outside I should be happy all of the time, I should be content, I should be vibing. I should be THRIVING. Instead I’m stuck in this black nothingness.

Asking for some tips on resources but more so for how to encourage/convince an older immigrant Asian American to engage in mental and emotional therapy/counseling.

I won't go into the details or else a novel would spring up...but my near 70 year old mother has a lot of anger, bitterness and insecurities that are crippling her relationship with her family, namely her very elderly mother. It breaks my heart and frightens me when she gets into one of diatribes about all the wrongs she's experienced in her life and it was a hard life bringing up two kids as a single parent. Parts of the diatribes border on paranoia and it's why I feel like it's time for professional help rather than ""letting off steam"" as she claims. She's utterly convinced her elderly mother has looked down on her for a lifetime. And even into her 90's, is taking the effort make sure my mom feels awful about her life. It pains me to see my mom berate my grandmother. I have told my mother that even if it's all true, what do you want your 90 something year old mother to do at this point? Her time is very limited--let it go and work on yourself...

The problem is she is adamantly against any suggestion of therapy--having the notion that it's for ""crazy"" people.  According to her reasoning, she's not crazy just badly treated and bullied all her life. I try to couch therapy as a just a good chat to an understanding and sympathetic ear. Any experiences and tips to share on how I can steer her towards considering therapy? I know I can't make her go, but I can't just stand by either.

I recently quit taking Zoloft completely because my dosage was too high and it was interfering with my Concerta.  I did this without consulting my psychiatrist (of course).  I, myself, did not notice any problems with quitting, but soon my wife, and parents pointed out that I was drinking too much, being irresponsible.  I have resolved to talk to my psychiatrist when I go back to get more Concerta about getting back on Zoloft, but my last dosage was way too high.  50 something, I remember, and it was stopping my Concerta from working.

My mom has a combination of anxiety, depression, eating disorder (all untreated) - she is currently taking care of my baby and she tries her best.

689,mentalhealth,1,"Please tell me I’m not a psychopath 
While waiting for my next psychologist appointment, I’ve been doubting who I really am, and who I’ve always been prior.

I’ve been in denial, though, and I’ve been looking for any other possible explanation for what I could have. 

- Like I said, I don’t feel many emotions at all, and when I do they’re fleeting. I don’t show emotions on my face either, and so talking to me would be like taking to a mannequin who thinks he’s a person

- It sounds hurtful, but there hasn’t been a single person I’ve felt consistently connected to in my entire life, and I do want to get closer to people but can’t seem to be vulnerable. I distance myself from people I like, and I attributed this to depression, but I’m sure it’s got to do with my inability to feel love

- The only thing I guess I feel is frustration, due to my uselessness at emotional depth, and I’ve cried before because of that but not sadness

- Twitches on the right side of my face when I feel uncomfortable in someone’s presence/ when someone enters my personal space (it’s recent but could be signs of underlying contempt that I can’t recognise). Makes it hard to talk to people when it feels like I’m either smirking or looking at them with contempt 
This feels like more of a defensive thing, but has only recently been happening


I’m aware depression can cause numbness, but there isn’t a cause for it and I honestly don’t feel as sad as I should be given my isolation. Anxiety/stress can be causing my tension, but it’s the fact that I can fully operate and not outwardly show these feelings to people that concern me. In times were I felt stressed, no one around me could ever tell.

I know I have traits of autism, and it’d be a brilliant combination with this, but I do have cognitive empathy, just not affective, while in autism I know it’s the opposite. 
To be honest, I didn’t know the importance of eye contact in conversations until at most a year ago, but now that I’m aware, I can make it to the point of accidentally intimidating people (I tend to stare through people, predatory gaze)

I’m not schizoid, I don’t like conversations or being with people, but I did at one point, and I’d like to be able to bond with people if it’s possible. 

PTSD causes a blunt effect, and I had an event recently that borders on traumatic, but it wasn’t severe enough to cause PTSD, and I’ve felt this way even before it. 

And I don’t have NPD, I’m narcissistic (telling by my posts), but I don’t try manipulate people or seek “supply”, and it’s hard to be self aware with that disorder.

So that led me here, at psychopathy. Really thank you if you read all of this, but I just want someone to tell me there’s another way out. 
I don’t want to be a psychopath, I don’t think it’s a disorder worth being proud about, much like any honestly, and I’d rather be normal. But I’ve realised I’m not, and so I guess I’m looking for advice on what to do now. 

Is there any way I can try to feel what someone else is feeling, even if it takes a moment to comprehend. Is there any advice for someone like me, should I even try to form relationships with people if I can never reciprocate feelings. Any advice would be appreciated.",tell m psychopath waiting psychologist appointment doubting really prior denial looking possible explanation like said don t feel emotion fleeting don t emotion face talking like taking mannequin think s person sound hurtful hasn t single person felt consistently connected entire life want closer people t vulnerable distance people like attributed depression m sure s got inability feel love thing guess feel frustration uselessness emotional depth cried sadness twitch right face feel uncomfortable s presence enters personal space s recent sign underlying contempt t recognise make hard talk people feel like m smirking looking contempt feel like defensive thing recently happening m aware depression cause numbness isn t cause honestly don t feel sad given isolation anxiety stress causing tension s fact fully operate outwardly feeling people concern time felt stressed tell know trait autism d brilliant combination cognitive empathy just affective autism know s opposite honest didn t know importance eye contact conversation year ago m aware make point accidentally intimidating people tend stare people predatory gaze m schizoid don t like conversation people did point d like able bond people s possible ptsd cause blunt effect event recently border traumatic wasn t severe cause ptsd felt way don t npd m narcissistic telling post don t try manipulate people seek supply s hard self aware disorder led psychopathy really thank read just want tell s way don t want psychopath don t think s disorder worth proud like honestly d normal realised m guess m looking advice way try feel feeling take moment comprehend advice like try form relationship people reciprocate feeling advice appreciated

691,mentalhealth,1,"My social worker told me to ""get over"" my sexual assault This is coming from the U.K. Apologies to those elsewhere if it doesn't translate to how your system works.

So, about 6 months ago I finally sought out help for my extreme anxiety (agoraphobia) and was put on beta-blockers by my GP. I asked her for therapy, explained I'd had untreated anxiety for 10+ years and I'd only just worked up the courage to seek help. I also told her that, if I didn't get help right away, I'd likely cancel further appointments b/c that's my cycle (I convince myself i'm ""fine"" days before appointments when the reality is i'm looking for an excuse not to go because even leaving the house is hard).

Anyway, she refused to refer me to a therapist because she said i didn't have a history to warrant it - I explained I didn't have the ""history"" to warrant it because I'd suffered in silence for 10 years, but she wasn't interested in that. 

In the UK, you can get free therapy if you're referred, and I couldn't afford to go private. Instead, she sent me to a ""social worker.""

Now, social workers are a weird one. I looked up the job description for them and it's *"" Social workers work with specific groups of clients, including children, the elderly and families in crisis, and help them to solve the problems they're facing. Generally, social workers specialise in either adult or child social care. Clients may be vulnerable or in difficult situations, so social workers need to be able to work under pressure and understand other people's viewpoints.""* Basically, they're therapist-lite, without the qualifications - I think?

Anyway, this guy was probably the most unsympathetic man I've ever met. He had a dismissive attitude and wouldn't let me open up about my past. He told me that people were ""moving away from talking about their past and focusing on the future"" in the mental health field, which, sounds like a load of bs to me. He then spent 3 sessions for 3 consecutive weeks telling me how much I was missing out on my life, as if I was going to turn around and be like ""holy shit you're right i better get over it, wtf was i thinking."" 

It was awful. By the third week, i was having panic attacks to and from the meetings.

So, for that third session, I decided to go all in. Since it was my first time seeking help, I thought the faults were on my end and that I needed to listen to him more, and maybe open up a lot more to get to the real issues. I had to go back for a repeat on my beta-blockers anyway (which didn't help me) but he snagged me from the waiting area before I could see my GP (i arrive everywhere about 45 minutes early. Idk why seeing as I'm so uncomfortable, but I'm always paranoid i'll miss something)

We sat down in his office and he asked me if i'd made any progress. I said no and he sighed. He told me he'd given me ""all the tools"" to get over it. He told me it couldn't be that bad and that i'm not a lost cause, and that I must not have been really trying.

I honestly thought I was either going to cry and lunge at him. I go into fight or flight when i go to the supermarket - so, when I feel threatened, it really does feel like life or death, even though, logically, I know it isn't.

""I was sexually assaulted when I was fifteen!"" I just blurted the words out. Idk why. It just came out. I'd never told someone face-to-face before (I've disclosed it to online friends, but that's it)

The guy shook his head and sighed an apathetic ""Oh okay then"" response at me. ""That must've been hard but you need to get over it. Now, lets get back to the point.""

Now, i'm no mental health expert, but I'm pretty sure the assualt I went through plays a part in why I'm so messed up today. I'm sure that speaking about it with an empathetic professional would help. I'm sure that even a stranger, let alone a ""social worker,"" would lend an ear if someone blurted that out.

I just burst into tears and left. The worst thing was I was so distraught I couldn't see my GP, missed my repeat for beta-blockers, and so humiliated I never went back. Now i have panic attacks thinking about it. It's taken me over an hour to write this post because i started shaking somewhere around the third paragraph.

I've finally worked up the courage to seek help again now and I'm about to sign on with a new GP. I'm actually thinking of writing a note to explain what I have and my experiences and just handing it to my GP on our first meeting, as maybe it was my lack of communicating well with my previous GP that had her thinking I wasn't as serious as I feel I am? I've also filed for my police reports from 10+ years ago, which will include a number of assaults I reported, hopefully with mentions of bruising etc as proof. 

I just want someone to actually listen and take me seriously when I tell them I live in a constant state of fight or flight the moment I step out my door.

Sure I guess but then again I let her take 3 weeks to pay me back for rent, so I guess that doesn't really help me when I get paid once a month. I don't really feel like she appreciates me anyways. Everyone knows this, my family, friends. I had a sexual history when I was young, like 13 years young. I'm okay and I have accepted that I shouldn't have. I wish I knew better and how it would've affected me.  She called me disgusting for having that past and so I feel like those feelings are what lead her to want to leave me. She's cleaning right now as I sit on the couch typing this up  I'm really not emotional and I don't want to get emotional  I don't know what to do. I don't know, honestly. I accepted her and her faults and decided she was worth sticking with, though she kept getting caught lying, and just hasn't been a really good person to me if I'm being fair to myself. I remember I had an appendectomy, and her face the whole time while I was getting drugged made me cry. I don't think about it but wow, that kinda sucks. 

Anyways, it's for the best but it's difficult to accept it. We live together, sharing a room so doesn't really help the situation, considering my financial situation, our lease isn't up until June.

I'm not sure what's going to happen. My father said he would help me get a new car but he has his own family and kids to worry about. He's also 8 states away. My mom is undependable due to her disabilities so not gonna help there. I have at least $800 that I have to pay SOON, but I never knew all of this would fall on me the way it has. I'm not sure what to do. 

I feel numb now and I guess I'll be fine but it's crazy. Putting it all together, this is the worst way to start a year ever. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I've gained 40 pounds since moving in with my girlfriend in May, I have no friends other than my best friends. I don't really know what to do right now. I feel clueless, and if anything afraid of what I can do to get out of here and somewhere I know what to do. 

I'm not the type to feel emotions as people do so I'm not sad. I just don't want to get to the point where I'm so low that I can feel nothing but sad. Idk. I just need something to help.",birthday tomorrow turning got accident december th totalled car going straight green hit car turning left driver said ate red light insurance isn t going cover attorney said d court itll year insurance company don t want fully cover car financing car barely afford anyways just know car important work owe medical fee student fee couldn t pay girlfriend just broke today s cheated s okay m sure s said haven t changed october sure mean financially sure guess let week pay rent guess doesn t really help paid month don t really feel like appreciates anyways know family friend sexual history young like year young m okay accepted shouldn t wish knew better affected called disgusting having past feel like feeling lead want leave s cleaning right sit couch typing m really emotional don t want emotional don t know don t know honestly accepted fault decided worth sticking kept getting caught lying just hasn t really good person m fair remember appendectomy face time getting drugged don t think wow kinda suck anyways s best s difficult accept live sharing room doesn t really help situation considering financial situation lease isn t june m sure s going happen father said help new car family kid worry s state away mom undependable disability gonna help pay soon knew fall way m sure feel numb guess ll fine s crazy putting worst way start year m sure point gained pound moving girlfriend friend best friend don t really know right feel clueless afraid know m type feel emotion people m sad just don t want point m low feel sad idk just need help
705,mentalhealth,1,"I'm always acting Not sure if this is the sub I'm looking for, but I suppose it is.

I have noticed something about myself back in my teens. Although sometimes I'd find it a bit inconvenient (I hated that it gave me less credibility when speaking about certain subjects, if people who knew me for a little longer were around), I always thought it was just a teenager thing...and maybe it is. I'm 20 years old, so I haven't fully developed yet. Could be my answer.

The thing is, I am never ""myself."" I'm always going through some phase where I'm fascinated by something/someone, and I want to act within that realm...I *live* for every detail that can make me a believable character. I read about the subject and I become somewhat obsessed with becoming the character I've set out to be. I focus on even the slightest details, such as how I move my eyebrows and certain word choices, tone of voice, and so on.

I feel like I have no real personal values. I have lost certain values over time upon losing interest in one of my personas that I thought were real values I had developed. I feel like I have no real personality and am always developing a new personality that I'll use for several months, or maybe a year.

And even when I'm in serious situations, I am mostly worried about playing my character in a believable way. I want to be noticed for my ""personality"" by people through my subtle ways. I don't try to give verbal hints...I'm willing to behave a certain way for months so people finally pay attention to everything and notice that I ""am"" a certain type.

This is compulsive behavior. I get the urge to do this even with people I know won't buy my new persona, such as my mom. I don't try as hard, because I don't want to be seen as an imposter, but I still get the urge to act.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but I'm curious if there are any mental illnesses that share these traits. Is this common? Is it just a normal thing for young, developing brains?",m acting sure sub m looking suppose noticed teen d bit inconvenient hated gave credibility speaking certain subject people knew little longer thought just teenager thing maybe m year old haven t fully developed answer thing m going phase m fascinated want act realm live make believable character read subject somewhat obsessed character set focus slightest detail eyebrow certain word choice tone voice feel like real personal value lost certain value time losing persona thought real value developed feel like real personality developing new personality ll use month maybe year m situation worried playing character believable way want noticed personality people subtle way don t try verbal hint m willing behave certain way month people finally pay attention notice certain type compulsive behavior urge people know won t buy new persona mom don t try hard don t want seen imposter urge act m asking diagnosis m curious illness share trait common just normal thing young developing brain

707,mentalhealth,1,"It hurts I just can't take it. I want to curl up in a ball on the floor and scream for hours. I want to cry and rip myself to pieces to get rid of all the feelings I'm feeling. I just can't ever seem to get rid of them without using self harm as an punishment for thinking or feeling this way. 

I can always be better, so therefor I'll never be good enough. People are smarter than me, prettier than me, friendlier than me, happier than me. I can't be good enough beside them. I can never be good enough as I make mistakes, way too many of them. I just want to be perfect, a perfect daughter, a perfect student and maybe a girlfriend too. But I'm not good enough to be even a friend. I push everyone away by insults and being mean, as I can't let them close. If I let them close it'll be so easy for them to just turn on me, and see me hurting. I can't be hurting, I can't feel like this. I'm not being perfect by crying and complaining to internet strangers, I'm not being perfect for not getting such good scores in my tests or being calm, I'm too emotional to have my dream job or to get into the university with my scores. 

My body is a disgusting piece of fat, skin and bones, too tall and bulky. It combined with acne and personality and my ways of pushing everyone away leaves me alone. I have friends in school, I laugh with them and love to spend time with them. But nobody wants to see me. I'm so god damn lonely, and just hurting so much. I can't feel like this as it's not right, a perfect person wouldn't complain but I just have to get it out. There's literally nobody out there for me. My mother is a narcissist with always bigger problems, father just doesn't talk to me, and why would I ever tell my friends? They'd try get me a therapist by the school, I'd have to go and talk to them. But I know that person doesn't care about me, shy would they? They have no emotional connection and have never met me. Then my parents would get to know how I obsess over any single thing in my life to make it perfect and so they'd think there's something wrong with me. And I can't let that happen, I can't be a disappointment with mental health issues, I have to wait to move out before getting help even if then. I 

I can't let go of anything in my life. If I lose control the person who takes it will hurt me. They'll use the control to make me look weak, and I can't be that. I have to be perfect. And it's not possible, but that's what others want. Nobody will take anything less, nobody wants to see a shriveled mess. We want happy people around us. We want to see the happiness and also be happy. But I'm not happy. I'm so stressed and anxious I feel like I want to just crawl into the deepest part of the room and scream. I want to tell my parents that they fucked me up so bad and I wouldn't be like this, I wouldn't be hurting like this, I wouldn't be this. I would be better, I would be closer for being the best, to having my happiness. I wouldn't have memories with pain and tears for not being a good enough toddler. I want to show people that I can be friendly, I have feelings but it would hurt me, I'm always the though one. I can take anything. But I really can't, it hurts me so much. I don't want to even die anymore, I just want to get rid of this feeling, I can't do anything with it burning inside me. It makes me only see the worst and I can't be happy, I'll never be enough for it. It knows everyone is watching and laughing, it knows what I fear the most and desire, it attacks those things and takes the last happy things away and puts them somewhere where I can't get them.

709,mentalhealth,1,"Why isn't life working??? I use to try so hard, maybe even too hard. I use to have so much hope even when things weren't going so well. My life feels cursed as if I'm supposed to be stuck in a mediocre life or worse, some strange kind of hell. 

I recently got laid off, because the company I'm working for moved to another state after not being able to find the correct person they needed to higher (or though they say). Right now I'm in a limbo of not knowing where to go or what to do. I have some ideas of a couple of things I want to do, but since so many things in my life ended in disappointment, I don't have all the hope I wish I had. I feel like a butterfly that had its wings torn off, no longer able to fly.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember, back in High School, which was over a decade ago, I was so hopeful for the future. Things weren't perfect at the time, but I was very hopeful. I always knew I was different, I didn't do very well in a school other than some select classes, which were usually classes I shared the most interest in and they usually were related with performing arts and theater. Other classes, I could focus on, no matter how much I tried. I also had a very difficult time comprehending what was being taught or what I was supposed to learn. Things just didn't make sense to me. Also, my social cues are off and I've always have had a hard time making friends or even keeping friends. I have recently discovered and realized (even though still undiagnosed) that I have Aspergers, which helped me make a little more sense of my world. When I was a child, my mom knew something was up, so she had me checked by professionals, they had the idea that I was on the autistic spectrum, but in the end, they left it at ""unknown"" because they couldn't figure it out. This was early-mid 90s, so maybe they didn't have everything they needed to give me an actual diagnosis? I don't know what happened there, I wish they could have diagnosed me with Aspergers back then, that would have helped a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

 Anyways, after I finished High School, I didn't continue schooling right away. Instead, I wasted a couple of years doing something for a religion I was brainwashed into, luckily I'm no longer in that cult, but it certainly had a big turn in my life and affected me in many ways, still leaving an imprint that is hardwired to my brain to this day even though I left 8 years ago. I left this cult about a year and a half after I was I finished this particular trip I went on after I finished High School. The time I left my religion was also the same time I started school again. I went to college to pursue my interest in performing arts and theater. The school was expensive, and even though I didn't do well in all of my classes, I did very well in others when it came to things that I was actually pursuing. This was a very good time of my life, unfortunately, it didn't last. My step-father at the time, who's schizophrenic and was very involved with the religion I use to be in had some very strange ideas about me that he thought were real. It was so bad that he even believed that I was having a sexual relationship with my mother (I'm disgusted just thinking about it). He belied my mother and I would sneak out at night while he was sleeping to have sex (thinking about his believes even today makes me want to barf). Anyways, this made him very jealous and I had to move out. (My mother eventually divorced him a few years after this, which I'm glad because he was also emotionally abusive). I was working part-time at a fast-food joint and was only making a quarter more than the federal minimum wage. I had to be on food stamps so that I could afford the rent for the room I was renting at the time. I was unable to keep my car because that was out of my budget. No car meant that I didn't have transportation to go to school. The area I lived at had very good public transportation... except the location of my school, so I couldn't even take public transportation to get there. So I did what I had to do, I dropped out. I dropped out and then went to a local community college instead. 

I changed my plans a little bit, decided to do generals and receiving an associate's degree there so that I can go to the local university instead because public transportation was very accessible to both the community college and the local university.  While I was going to the community college, I was of course still working at that fast food joint so that I could continue paying rent. I didn't have any other financial support other than student loans, which wasn't enough to pay for my rent, not to mention food, so I had to keep my job to continue to support me. Plus, I needed to have a job if I wanted to continue receiving food stamps. I wish I didn't have to keep my job so that I could fully focus on school, which would have been key to my disability. If I didn't have to work, I could have used that time to focus on my school more, which could have helped me pass a couple of my classes that I ended up failing which caused other issues a little later down the road. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the semester ended, I registered for my new classes. Things at work weren't going so well, I worked there for a couple of years, never got a raise, I was pulling teeth to get a raise, which was unpromised. I was very loyal to my work but the general manager under-appreciated me, she even screwed me over, she would cut my hours and even illegally removed some over-time I had because she was more concerned about her bonuses than what was rightfully mine. I even have my suspicions that she clocked me out early before by an hour or two, making me unknowingly work for free and off the clock, this woman stole time from me. Eventually, she moved to another state and we got a new general manager, this was the guy I was pulling teeth with to try and get a raise. But, instead, I found another job that almost paid double of what I was making an hour. The job was full time, which did cause some issues for my school schedule, so I decided to do part-time school the time being and just changed my schedule for the upcoming semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Around that same time, my mother separated from her husband and moved to an apartment. She couldn't financially afford this by herself, so I moved in with her to the new apartment as well as one of my sisters in a two-bedroom apartment. My mom and my sister shared the master bedroom and I had the other room to myself. School started again, which I went to class after work by taking public transportation. On the first day of class, after class, I took the bus home. While I was at the bus stop, this foreign girl that was in my class was also waiting for the same bus. So I started to talk to her. I was a very lonely guy, never really had a longterm relationship before, lol, I was even a virgin at the time. The last relationship I was in before that only lasted about a month, which I had that relationship while I was still in that religion shortly after I got back from that particular trip. So I start talking more to this girl from class. We became friends, but I wanted more than friendship. I really liked her, but she had a boyfriend I come to find out in her home country. We were still hanging out and such and even though I knew she had a boyfriend, I decided to take my chances and asked her to be my girlfriend. She said no.

&amp;#x200B;

She still wanted to hang out with me and remain friends after that, but I had to explain that I had feelings for her and would have a hard time just staying friends. But even after I explained that we still hung out anyways and stayed friends, at least for a little while. As we hung out more, I got closer to each other, I had a strong feeling that we would soon be a couple. One day we were hanging out at her apartment. I was about to leave, but she wanted me to stay. So I did as she begged. She didn't have a couch or anything to sleep on, so she had me sleep on her bed that night. We didn't have sex or anything. She fell asleep and I couldn't fall asleep. I just laid there and kept my hands to myself, except for one time when she almost fell off the bed why she was sleeping, I pulled her back up so that she wouldn't fall on the floor. But I was wide awake the entire time. I tried to sleep, but just couldn't. This was my first time laying in bed with another girl. The next morning, she woke up. I not sure what happened, but she looks at me and then starts kissing me. I kiss her back, we are then we completely start making out and holding each other, I felt like my dream has come true. After that, she broke up with her boyfriend in her home country to be with me and then we were a couple. 

We finished that semester being together. My schooling went ok. At the end of the semester, my girlfriend and I had moved in together. I think I took the following semester off and didn't take any classes, though I can't remember exactly why. My girlfriend, of course, continued taking classes and I think I just worked. Later on, my job decided to lay off some employees because it was too slow. So I was unemployed, I got laid off towards the end of the semester and the new semester was about to start. Since I was unemployed, I thought it would be good to take classes for the following semester. Unfortunately, since my grades didn't meet standards, I was unable to get student loans, so I would have to pay out of pocket. I decided, since I needed to get a new job anyway, so stick with part-time, and took two evening classes, one of those classes my girlfriend and I had together. I found a new job and was able to work and go to class, but I had to pay rent and the place we were living in was expensive, so I couldn't afford to pay for my classes. Eventually, we moved to a new place that wasn't so expensive. My girlfriend has always begged me to get a car because we were always walking and taking public transportation everywhere and she grew tired of that. After being pressured to get a car for a while, I eventually gave in and got a car. It wasn't easy to get a car, because my credit score wasn't all that great. I couldn't continue school, because my tuition was still unpaid for, I was unable to register for school. So I continued working full time. I found a new and better full-time job and left the one I had for this new job. I worked at this new job for a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend ever since for the most part. But she is abusive, mostly emotionally and verbally but also sometimes physically. I've left her a couple of times, but she promised in the past that she changed and my stupid self would get back with her. But she hasn't changed. She wasn't abusive right away, I don't think signs of her abusiveness didn't actually show up until we were together for at least half a year. She's also got mood swings, where at one point everything seems fine and then out of the blue she just starts yelling at me for who knows what. Sometimes I'm just minding my own business and then she starts arguing with me. When people yell at me, I get really quiet and I don't say anything until it stops. With her, it doesn't really stop, and because I get quiet, I'm not giving her the attention she wants. She hates being ignored and will sometimes start hitting me to get my attention. Sometimes when she pushes me that way and the pressure builds up, I lose it and then I'm furiously screaming at her out of stress, sometimes gesturing aggressiveness even though I'm not hitting her, I'm sometimes throwing something to the other side of the room. Which scares her when I'm acting like that and that makes her angrier and then she may even hit me because of it. Things are out of control, my mind always tries to tell me to calm down and just leave, but for some reason, I can't and I'm still freaking out. Yelling at her and telling her not to hit me.

&amp;#x200B;

She's always calling me lazy, saying I don't do enough. In a way she's right. I haven't done much at all with performing arts or theater at all recently, even though I've been really wanting to. But I think my depression and my anxiety got the better part of me. Not doing what I've been wanting to do, but also struggling with money and financially, I tried getting into entrepreneurship and start my own online business. But that hadn't been easy. I tried selling stuff on Amazon using Fulfillment by Amazon, but I was actually spending more than what I was making and I wasn't selling much even though I advertised, so I ended up having Amazon send me back all my stuff. Later on, I tried again, but this time not with Amazon, I discovered Dropshipping, studied and learned a lot about that and opened my own store on Shopify. I wasn't selling on there either, even after following some strategies I found online and having a Shopify store that was opened for half a year I only made one sale even with advertising, so I gave up. Sometimes it feels like there's someone or something keeping me from being successful. Purposely stopping me from becoming successful and financially secure. But even though I'm sure that's all in my head, it almost feels real, like the big guys, maybe part of Google, Amazon (fyi, I'm not actually blaming companies like Google or Amazon, just a funny idea in my head) or some big corporation or maybe even the Illuminati or something making sure the little guys like me make sure that I stay down and never progress. But again, I'm more convinced that this isn't reality and just my imagination. But it indeed feels like I'm stuck in the low life mediocre life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently going through a lot of depression, stuck in this limbo of this strange hell. I don't know what to do. Sometimes I wish I was never born and have never existed at all. My girlfriend yelled at me earlier today, making me feel worthless. She's always talking about business and how great capitalism is and how I need to study more and read more books and all kinds of nonsense. It's so boring when she talks because when she's not yelling at me, that's 99% of her conversation. I'm not even allowed to have other conversations much for the things I'm interested in. Then, of course, she gets mad at me when I show boredom. I don't know what to do anymore. Since I'm unemployed, I've been delivering food using food delivery apps. And then she yells at me telling me I'm not doing enough of that and that I should deliver more so that I can afford rent. I feel lucky that she might be moving back to her home country soon because that would end this relationship by default. I don't understand why it's so hard to leave, especially a toxic and unhealthy relationship. I guess I'm afraid to feel alone because getting into a relationship is a serious and complicated task for me because I don't have the that great social skills, I'm actually very awkward to be around with, which is the reason why I even have a hard time making friends. I'm the kind of person that doesn't know what to say or how to say the things that I want to say. I'm also not all the attractive, nor in good shape and not all that healthy, so getting into another relationship almost feels impossible. But this one is toxic, so I understand that I really need to get out of this one.

As far as finding a new job, that hasn't been easy. I'm not all that great at interviews, which I think is normal for most and I know I can land a job because I've done it before. But at the same time, I'm tired of working  9 to 5 jobs, just barely making enough on slave wage. Which is the reason I tried starting a couple of business, I'm just tired of this. I hate having to work to live and that I have live to work, what is that all about. I feel like life should be so much more than just work, eat, sleep, repeat and it's causing me to be more and more depressed. I can't handle it anymore. I don't want to live like this, I hate this. I've tried so hard and I kept trying again and again and again. Always trying to find ways to find new strategies and try again but then keep watching myself fail over and over and over again that my hope that I use to have so much is hanging on by a thread. I'm only 30, but my health isn't all the great and I feel like I might die by heart attack anytime soon, which scares me, but at the same time, I'd rather be dead. I think I'm starting to become suicidal because I don't know what to do anymore. I need help, but I can't afford help. I'm in serious debt and lately, I've been getting lawsuit after lawsuit from creditors from unpaid debt from years ago because I couldn't afford to pay for this or that, which is just adding more and more on my shoulders. I don't know what to do anymore. I stay up late watching Youtube and playing video games until late to get away from the world and then sleep past noon. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as good things that are happening, I'm seeing a talent agent next week because I really want to pursue theater and performing arts and thought I should really do something about it, but at the same time, I'm filled with anxiety. Because of my personality, because of my lack of social skills, I have this anxiety that I will be turned down. So I'm really hanging on to that hope that's hanging on by a thread, hoping that this will work out, that I will pursue my dreams. But overall, I really need help in life and I just don't know where to turn.

If you've gotten this far, I really want to thank you for sticking with my story this far. I know that was a lot. I'm really hoping somebody, anybody will really analyze everything I have written. Someone that can really look into this and provide me with the help I need as far as my mental health goes at the least. There's so much more in my story that I haven't mention, something much more severe that I went through not to long ago, perhaps that'll be another post for another time because that was a very scary time of my life. But I hope that I can find what I need here in this subreddit.",isn t life working use try hard maybe hard use hope thing weren t going life feel cursed m supposed stuck mediocre life worse strange

Or you know when people just like bottle up emotions, pretending everything is fine just do as to not burden the other person... Makes sense I hope.

Anyway, my question is.. What's the point of it? Why does the concept of cry for help exist when literally any solution to improving mental health is about YOU doing things so like... What's the point? Why do we do it, when we know that other people can't help us in any way or form, maybe guide but that's about it ?

712,mentalhealth,1,"Don’t you hate how admitting your mental illness basically turns people away? I told someone (who is a new friend that I really value and hope to grow our friendship) about my BPD and eating disorder. I was hesitant because why would I do that; it has never worked well in the past. But 2020 is the year of me being honest with myself and about myself, so I did. They said the need time to process it.

That was over 24 hours ago. I haven’t heard anything. And I know it’s my dumb brain thinking the worst (that I’ll literally never hear from them), and I hate that I said something and I hate that they will want to cut ties and I hate myself.

It’s hard man. I don’t have friends; I ran them off when I was REALLY struggling, and now that I’m better I’m afraid to let anyone close. I was actually going to try with this one, and now this.

Not to mention my breakup is officially official; it’s what’s best, and we will still be friends, but it hurts a little. 3 years is a long time.

713,mentalhealth,1,"How do I change myself without becoming resentful? I don't know where to post this. I posted something similar on [r/selfhelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/) but didn't get any responses, so I hope this is the right place.

So this is something I can't quite get over. The mainstay advice if you're unattractive is to basically get in shape and become physically fit. I've been going to the gym for 2 years, have made okay progress but honestly am not where I should be. Because I'm not at my potential looks-wise, I feel worthless about who I currently am. I don't want to be happy until I've reached my full potential and this is causing a lot of anguish. When I look at gym transformation pictures, I don't feel motivated to change myself. Instead I feel bitter and resentful about how much better my life would be if I looked good and feel pity for my current meek self. There is no logic to these feelings. Of course it would be better to be strong and have muscles than to not, but to me this is synonymous with the paradigm that until I've reached that goal, I basically suck and am worthless. I just can't stand the thought of people in the future liking me because I've reached (lets face it) an evolutionary standard of male attractiveness, whereas before that I was a loser worth no ones time.

Has anybody else dealt with this? I want to change for the better, but I also don't want the journey to be painful. I could really use an eye opener right now, or some book recommendations/general advice.

714,mentalhealth,1,"Could I Have Anxiety? I apologize if this is out of place for this reddit as a question for what essentially may seem like a request for a diagnosis, but please, hear me out first. I want to ask rather if it's worth checking into. I'm currently 16, close to 17, and living with my parents. I would have gone to them about this, but in the past they've tended to tell me that any concerns I have about myself are unfounded or will disappear in time. It's more of an optimistic outlook than them being negligent, but I still don't feel comfortable going directly to them about it.

  I think I might have social anxiety. I don't believe it's severe, but I think it could be affecting me in negative ways. I always feel nervous when interacting with people outside of my family. I always worry about whether or not they look down on me, whether or not they may have ulterior motives, and always try to consider the worst case scenario to make sure it's aborted. I can hardly carry on a good conversation with anyone outside of the few I am more comfortable with before stopping out of fearing how stupid they must see me. I can stand familiar, more organized collections of people, such as classrooms, but I find it difficult to even talk to most of these individuals, as I recognize them but don't know them personally. I'm currently in my Junior year of highschool, and even though I haven't had any problems with going to pep ralleys, (Which are essentially mandatory,) recently I've started skipping them due to the uncomfort they were giving me from everyone being crowded together. I am at my worst in more disorganized settings, say like at a party, and  with people I am unfamiliar with. Rarely can I muster any courage to overcome the fear that comes to talking with people I am unfamiliar with without feeling like impending doom is on the horizon. Because of these issues, I've started getting very frustrated with myself. I don't have any close friends, and I constantly fear putting off any casual friends I make, which has on several different occasions caused me to stop talking with them, and eventually lead to us drifting apart.

However, the worst moment I've had that I can remember in regards to a social setting was when I was going to sing the national anthem with my school's choir at a football game. I was still unfamiliar as to how I'd get in, whether or not I had to still pay for admission. My father had dropped me off and pulled right up near the entrance, and was waiting to see if everything would turn out okay. But just the idea of asking the admissions people was horrifying. After I eventually got out of the car, I started walking up to them but stopped before simply walking back and forth. Eventually, I heard my father call my name and I walked closer to talk, telling him I didn't think I felt comfortable doing it. After going back and forth, my dad, peeved about the situation, and asked for me. It's not a situation I'm proud of, and it still embarrasses me to this day. I've had similar situations where I've done okay with walking up and asking a random person a question, but it usually happened after a period of mental prep time until I felt ""ok"" enough to go and talk.

Again, I know this is a subreddit for mental health, and I understand it's primarily a platform for those suffering from mental illness. I feel bad about using this to ask, but as currently I don't feel comfortable talking to my parents about this, I thought, ""Hey, what the hell?"" The internet is the one place I don't feel constantly exposed, so I definitely felt more comfortable about asking this. My real question is whether or not this is worth getting checked out with someone. If this seems more like shyness or social awkwardness than anything else, then obviously it's probably not worth the time. However, even if it's possible, could I try to ride it out? I don't expect an official diagnosis, but I guess I just wanted some other opinions before I jump to any crazy conclusions.

720,mentalhealth,1,"First post Hi all

I'm making this post regarding ""episodes"" I had when I was younger. If it is of any help, I have struggled with OCD throughout my teens and still am, although I doubt this is relevant.

While living in France between the ages of 8-14, I would often have periods lasting weeks where I would question every single thing around me.

 It's hard to describe but I would ask myself questions such as ""Why is the floor like this ?, Why can I touch ?, What is hearing ?"" , it was as if I was being overwhelmed by my senses while also having an existential crisis if that makes sense. 

Something else to note is that I used to always call what I felt ""The feeling"" as I had no other way of describing it at the time. I also remember it being triggered by the cramped attic in my house as well as the emptiness and quietness of the area, as it was a very rural.

I am now 17 and haven't had anything similar happen for a good few years now, but it has always bugged me because I've never heard of anything similar from anybody I know, I never knew why it happened in the first place or what I was even experiencing. I also worry that it could creep up on me again as this was usually what would happen back when these ""episodes"" were much more frequent. 

I know that I would be able to get much more help out of a professional (Which I plan to seek help from), but I've never actually taken the time to write any of this down. If anybody reading this can relate or can think of what this sounds like please let me know, I would appreciate it very much.

721,mentalhealth,1,"Need help finding a mental health facility that is NOT for drug/alcohol abuse. My sister attempted suicide this past weekend.  She has been under the care of a therapist and a psychiatrist for many years.  She has NO  substance abuse issues so does not need to go to drug/alcohol rehab which seems to be all we can find and all her insurance company can recommend.    She regrets the attempt and is desperate for help, but we can not find what she is looking for. Her insurance company Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield has not returned 6 phone calls made to them.

She wants to learn how to deal with these traumas and not just throw medicine at them. 

Backstory:

My sister lost our mother and unexpectedly her 11-year-old son a few years ago within a few months of each other. She found my nephew dead when she went to wake him up for school. My mom and sister were very co-dependent because my dad died when I was 16 and she was 7.  I left for college shortly after and they were so close because they were both very co-dependent people.  She now has the same relationship with her daughter because of her son's death and her husband's behavior.  My brother-in-law is a con-artist and mean.

733,mentalhealth,1,"I’m a bit lost honestly Attempt 3 at writing this. I’m on a throwaway account and please bear with me since it’s a bit difficult to put into words. 

So I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety. It’s gotten to the point where I’m pretty much not going outside during the day and just staying in my room away from anyone who could hurt me. I’m too afraid to talk about my feelings, possibly due to talking to someone a while ago who said that they would help and they just said that I was ‘silly’. 

To make the next part hopefully easier to understand I’ll call myself H. 

I feel like I’m a mask or a shell of a person and the real H is hidden inside. I’m pretty sure there’s someone blocking the real H from actually coming back out into this world. It’s like they’re telling me I have to complete certain things of a challenge to get the real H back into the actual world. 

The real H is like a ‘normal person’ would be. However they’re never actually here since it’s as if they’re trapped. On the other hand I feel like I’m controlled by people on what I should wear, eat or say. 

Sometimes I feel completely disassociated from the world and other times I feel as if everything I’m seeing is in a movie. Sometimes I feel happy as a human can possibly get (and as of recent I’ve noticed I also tend to ‘want’ to spend more money when I feel like that) and other times I have no interest in absolutely anything. 

I feel like I can keep going but at this point there’s probably no barrier between reality and a fake world. I have animals to care for (3 hamsters) which are helping I guess? 

I’ve been listening to more and more positive songs recently. I guess that’s a step forward?

735,mentalhealth,1,"Break up help 
Hi everyone. I’ve never made a post and I hope I’m doing this right. I just really want someone to talk to about how I’ve felt since me and my ex girlfriend broke up. It might sound like a small thing but it’s really impacted my life since and I bottle up all the emotions because I don’t feel comfortable talking to most people about it properly. My ex girlfriend struggled with depression (still does) for years before we went out but it started to get bad again towards the end of our relationship, and the stress of the relationship mixed with it was her reason for breaking things off. Anyways she ended up being really mean to me afterwards, saying stuff like she didn’t love or miss me and just generally making fun of me. It was a big shock because I still loved her and didn’t understand her reason for being so mean, and it put me in a really dark place. I wanted to reach out to her but she wouldn’t talk to me seriously and I was so confused as to what I did wrong. A few weeks after the break up I started going into these dissociative states sometimes which were really scary, and got a few small panic attacks. I’ve been really down aswell, and I find it hard to see how things can possibly get much better. The breakup was 3 months ago and I just want to know what I can do to not feel so bad all the time. Any help or discussion would be really appreciated.
Thanks guys!

742,mentalhealth,1,"Kung Fu, Smiling, and Mental Health Hi,

I was super depressed.  Like critically and considering bad things.  

I'm in a very serious Kung Fu school.  I was practicing in front of a teacher's aid.  And he was correcting my form.  The Kung Fu needs to be practiced daily and we don't always get to practice in front of someone who is taught how to coach someone.

And he told me I have to smile.  Otherwise I am just teaching myself to be angry.  I thought it was ridiculous.  But I did it because I have insane amount of respect for the Master of the school.  

So whenever I'm in pain in my work out, I just smile.  That turned into giggling and laughter.  

And then that slowly spread to other parts of my life.   I started jogging, and on the uphills I would just smile.  I think my legs are going to fall off, but I'm smiling. 

I learned that joy, happiness, and optimism are wonderful feelings.  But they also can be a discipline.  They can be learned, practiced, and repeated on demand.

Even if you don't believe this, I bet if someone showed up and gave you a birthday cake, and said Happy Birthday.  Even if it wasn't your birthday, you would smile, and most likely laugh.  So everyone is capable of learning this.  

I have recovered from depression, addressed anger issues, I'm super productive and work 16 hours a day, happily.  I even had a huge blow out with my family and somehow it didn't turn into a complete nightmare that takes years to heal.  We just accepted each other's feelings and moved on and started to rebuild a more functional relationship.  Like in a few weeks!

So maybe this could help one of you.  I know you care about yourself and others because you are on this sub.  

So maybe you can work out, or jog.  And practice smiling while doing it.  You can train your brain the way I did.  Hopefully someone finds this helpful.

Keep the effort up.  I believe in all of you.",kung fu smiling hi super depressed like critically considering bad thing m kung fu school practicing teacher s aid correcting form kung fu need practiced daily don t practice taught coach told smile just teaching angry thought ridiculous did insane respect master school m pain work just smile turned giggling laughter slowly spread part life started jogging uphill just smile think leg going fall m smiling learned joy happiness optimism wonderful feeling discipline learned practiced repeated demand don t believe bet showed gave birthday cake said happy birthday wasn t birthday smile likely laugh capable learning recovered depression addressed anger issue m super productive work hour day happily huge blow family didn t turn complete nightmare take year heal just accepted s feeling moved started rebuild functional relationship like week maybe help know care sub maybe work jog practice smiling doing train brain way did hopefully find helpful effort believe
743,mentalhealth,1,"I'm angry and mad at friends for things they did years ago and that didn't make me mad at the time So, let me tell you about how I'm feeling and if anyone has any clue of what the hell is happening to me, I'd be very thankful.

During all three years of high school, I had this group of friends, and always felt like I had to give my all to be part of the group, bend to their likes and tastes and manners and etc, I changed a lot of my habits because it annoyed them, that kind of things. I was always dedicating myself so that I could be part of the group and very frequently I felt that they treated me very badly, many times I felt humiliated and ridiculed, but I never managed to tell them about how I felt, neither could I step out of the group because I thought that it was either that or not having any friends at all.

So I always suppressed my feelings (as I do with everything, actually).

However, these feelings that I so suppressed for so long now came to the surface and I feeling extremly angry and mad at them. I can't even talk to them anymore, we have a group chat in which I stopped talking. Even when they talk to me in the group chat, I just pretend I didn't see the text and ignore it completely because I can't put myself to talk to them. Yesterday, one of them asked in said group chat if I was mad at them and I continued to ignore because I just can't tell them that yes, I am.

I've tried talking to her about things I don't like about her and she has tried to change herself too but I think that's how she's born, her personality, it's inborn. No matter how hard she tries to change herself (and I can see the effort too sometimes) she doesn't realize she's still the same. It's because of the kind of family she came from and how she generally is as a person. I don't see basic etiquettes in her and I don't know how to deal with her.

It would have been easy for me if she didn't care about our friendship, it would have been easier for me to cut her off from my life or at least set boundaries, but she always comes to me and asks me if there's something about her that's bothering me. She cares about our friendship but I don't have the energy to deal with her and let her know what's bothering me about her because we've had the same conversation a million times and she unintentionally always comes back to square one no matter how hard she tries to change herself.

I don't know what to do and how to deal with her and it's really affecting my mental health. I can't bear to be around someone who's toxic to me and doesn't respect/acknowledge what I have to say.

Can someone please help me?

757,mentalhealth,1,"Anyone else feel they lack in social instinct? Ever since getting a job as a cashier I’ve begun to realize just how long it takes me to process events as they happen before me. I don’t think I lack in common sense but I can’t seem to ever find the right words or make decisions about conversations. I’m not exactly shy, the indecisiveness applies to my actions as well. I never know which actions and conversations to prioritize. I feel that it may relate to the fact that I have never really felt obligated to socialize and forcing myself to stresses me out to the max. Going from social settings in which I have autonomy over involvement towards a setting in which my action and communication is not optional has got me messed up.

One minor thing (I prefer not to say what), seems to have pushed me over the edge. All it was was a specific event getting moved back a few weeks. I don't remember the last time I ever felt this angry. About 10-15 minutes ago, I was so mad I wanted to punch something or break something...to do *something*. Usually I'm good at controllong my anger. If I'm mad or annoyed I'll just go sit in my room and listen to music and it'll reside relatively quickly. 

What I feel now though, is different than that. I want to take my anger out on something. Punching a pillow won't help. Honestly I just feel broken inside. I know this won't reside fast. I don't know. It's like I'm angry but also numb at the same time. I almost threw up due to crying so much. I wish I had someone (though not family, I feel weird around family) to hug me for a while. No internet hugs will help. The one person I want to tell is a teacher who actually seems to care about me, but I won't see them until Tuesday, and even then I'll wimp out of saying anything.

759,mentalhealth,1,"Why I don't trust therapists and counsellors anymore ! I always had people tell me how going to a therapist changed Their life and how happy and better they feel in life but I never really felt comfortable myself to go and talk to a therapist until last year ....... Last year I was facing some really serious anxity , depression and I was having mental breakdowns in class or in school washroom I even became extremely suicidal that is when I thought I need to see a therapist or a counselor but being from an Indian family I knew I couldn't ask my parents for it so I decided to try my school therapist .

The first therapist I met was not from my school she was a specialist that our school hired who came to school 2 times a week and helps people .... The first time I met her I had a full on mental breakdown and I cried and told her about my feelings and showed her my scares that I had from cutting my wrist and she was really nice she gave me good advice and I left there feeling more happy and relieved ( although I know it's common sense that a therapist doesn't share personal cases of their patients with anyone but still I made sure to tell her again and again that I don't want my parents to know that I am seeing a therapist ) ... A few days later my father was called into the school by my therapist and she told my father all the reason of be being depressed I know she thought it would be helpful but it just caused more problems cause when I went home my father was really angry at me and be said really bad that's to me and yelled at me for hours that just made me more disturbed .

A few days later our school hired another school counselor who I got to know about cause she used to call many people to her office for sessions ( people who were trouble makers or like that ) and one day she comes to my class and she is like does anyone needs help and I said yes she called me in her office and we talk for a while and she listened and gave really good advice and I told her the same thing I told the last counselor that not to disclose this information with anyone cause I don't want my parents to know and she reassured me that it won't happen , these sessions went on for weeks and I was getting better but around that time I had a really bad mental breakdown in my class and I was screaming and I ran away from class crying ( because I lost pretty much all my friends and I was alone and my home situation at that time was worse and everything was just affecting me a lot and I was also being assaulted by school boys ) and I went to her and I said some stuff like. "" I don't wanna live anymore "" and idk if that made her scared or something but she told the head of the department about this who then called "" my previous therapist "" and both of those counselors then called my parents and told them every little detail of my life that I shared with them .

That night was the worst night of my life  , my parents treated me worse than before no one in school wanted to talk to me because of which I didn't go to school on weeks on weeks and failed all my classes and I became all the more suicidal . 

Although I am in a much better state on mind right now what does therapists did have scared me for life and I don't think I will ever be able to trust another one again",don t trust therapist counsellor anymore people tell going therapist changed life happy better feel life really felt comfortable talk therapist year year facing really anxity depression having breakdown class school washroom extremely suicidal thought need therapist counselor indian family knew couldn t ask parent decided try school therapist therapist met school specialist school hired came school time week help people time met breakdown cried told feeling showed scare cutting wrist really nice gave good advice left feeling happy relieved know s common sense therapist doesn t share personal case patient sure tell don t want parent know seeing therapist day later father called school therapist told father reason depressed know thought helpful just caused problem cause went home father really angry said really bad s yelled hour just disturbed day later school hired school counselor got know cause used people office session people trouble maker like day come class like doe need help said yes called office talk listened gave really good advice told thing told counselor disclose information cause don t want parent know reassured won t happen session went week getting better time really bad breakdown class screaming ran away class cry lost pretty friend home situation time worse just affecting lot assaulted school boy went said stuff like don t wanna live anymore idk scared told head department called previous therapist counselor called parent told little life shared night worst night life parent treated worse school wanted talk didn t school week week failed class suicidal better state mind right doe therapist did scared life don t think able trust
760,mentalhealth,1,"Is there something wrong with me? I think its very possible I have some sort of disorder or phobia and it really bugs me often. There's a lot of small particular things and whatnot but ill describe them all now. 

Ever since I was young maybe 7 or 8, I have been very annoyed by the number nine. It kind of makes me anxious and irritated similar to when you don't feel like speaking or when someone won't stop talking. I cannot leave any tv on volume level nine or I am very displaced. That number is just wrong and shouldn't exist is how I feel. Not sure if its because its so close to being a 10 or 8 but I don't know. 

I often imagine lines that extend off of items or other things. Like a box will have 2 lines come off of each corner and the same goes for tables and really anything else. Well when I step on these lines I get minority irritated and it kinda just builds up to annoy me or make me walk certain ways. 

When I tap something I have to tap 3 more times to complete the pattern and if not I get left with that irritated feeling again. I always need to make it go left right right left. I use both fingers arms legs or even just flexing a muscle. 

Very often I get anxiety about certain things like leaving a charger in an outlet to make sure it doesn't catch fire or sometimes ill triple check that I did something. At work I check every order I put in about 3 or 4 times or I'm anxious and uncomfortable. 

Tattoos make me very uncomfortable and when someone has one, I feel like they're tainted. I lost a very valuable, long relationship because my girlfriend got a tattoo despite knowing about my fear/discomfort of them. After that she wasn't attractive to me. Not beautiful or gorgeous like before. I tried to ignore my annoyance of it, but it was so much I couldn't touch her. 

Often if a cup, plate, wipe, pencil ECT is even near something dirty, I will feel that its tainted (very similar to a tattoo) and I don't wanna use it or have to wash it. 

My silverware, napkins ECT when I eat out need to be finely arranged in front of me or I'm feel gross and annoyed. All my friends or (ex) girlfriends have always jokingly rearranged it to look poor and it makes me feel very upset. It ruins my mood and makes me sick of being there. 

This is all kinda affecting my life I feel like all in small ways, but it overall ends up to be more. Sometimes these things aren't as active but it tends to be when I am focused on other things.  Am I normal? Are these things everyone does or feels like? If not what could this be?

761,mentalhealth,1,"What do you do for someone that resists getting treatment? So I have this roommate. He’s a homeless guy my mom befriended and got him to move in to the trailer in our driveway.

He had obvious mental issues. He says he’s being targeted. Hears threatening voices, sees things out of the corner of his eye like people driving by and flipping him off, the whole 9 yards.

He watches a lot of YouTube videos from other “Targeted Individuals” which is very unhelpful of course.

He has also been having some kind of legal issues that I think are unrelated, but I don’t know the details. So whenever he has a court date coming up or anything like that his symptoms really come out. Recently he contacted the FBI and gave them whatever evidence he has. So that has got him going recently.

Today he’s just been pacing around the house seesawing between sobbing, and strings of cusswords. He’s in a very cyclical thought pattern so he’ll say one thing, that leads to the next thing and then another thing that leads back to the first thing like that.

He keeps trying to corner me or my mom to go off on his tangent about being targeted and how unfair it is, but we’ve both heard it a thousand times and it’s just tiresome when we’re just trying to watch TV. And since we’re not psychiatrists we don’t have any real helpful advice for him.

All I know about these targeted individual types is that denying what they’re experiencing and suggesting they get help just drives them further into the fantasy. But doing nothing and just letting him work up into these frenzies doesn’t seem right either.

Sometimes we try to get him to change the subject, or watch something funny but that doesn’t even have much success because he always tries to steer the conversation back to the targeting.

764,mentalhealth,1,"Caretakeing for my father. A rant. My father has schizophrenia, which is hard. But he is ALSO illiterate, which is very hard. So you could say I’m a full time care giver. Today i have to drive him from his house, to a town thirty minutes away to go to health and human services and figure out why the FUCK his insurance is acting up. It makes no seance and i cant get him his medications without it. (Out of pocket, his shot is 3 grand.) ever seance he was committed, i have been unable to get his health insurance information(thanks HIPPA),  i think they gave him a new one? Maybe? But we have yet to hear a word about this “new insurance.” I’m worried the drive will trigger him and make him less willing to go to the doctors appointment we have set up for his shot (you know, if i can figure out his insurance) next week.

Its just very difficult and is makeing me depressed, hearing your dad scream shut up to himself for an hour commute to a hospital is so goddamn disturbing and i feel like no matter what i do, its not enough. Yes i got him to a mental health facility, but now his insurance is fucking up. And he is now two weeks over due for his shot which means he could go back into crisis at any moment, yet i have to jump through a million hoops to get it payed for. The whole experience is leaving me very hollow. I thought i had a big enough heart to take care of him and help him, but every step forward takes me two steps back. 

My husband is being very supportive but when we were taking my father down to the mental health hospital (this was all a week before Christmas) ((mind you that we did just have a mentally ill man scream shut up to us on a hour and a half long car ride.)) my husband  screamed ‘you suck’ at me after we dropped him off. He’s apologized up and down for it but now whenever i feel like asking for help or feel myself getting emotional about it, I hear him screaming that at me. (Mind you i also have PTSD,i cant handle people screaming at me), and I almost agree with it, i do suck. I feel like my burden is now burdening all these other people, and I almost feel like they are blaming me, for my dads behavior and not being able to control him. It just suuuuuuuuuuuuucks. It makes every day suck. It makes me go to bed stressed and wake up stressed and i spend all the middle parts crying in my living room because i dont want to put my husband in position of caretaking for me, you know? Like, i have to be the strong person in our relationship eventually right?

765,mentalhealth,1,"I'm so alone and i'm tired I’m so tired of constantly feeling like I have to prove myself to everyone I meet in order for them to determine if they want to keep me in their life or not. I'm tired of there always being someone better and being left behind. When I'm alone with people, things seem to go okay but the minute we get into a group, I'm ignored for everyone else. I'll try to add something meaningful and contribute to the conversation so I'm not sitting there like a rock but when I do, no one responds or even acknowledges me so I end up being that way anyways or even sometimes just leaving.

I finally met someone who I didn't feel like was a fuck boy. And then all of a sudden it all changes and I don't have a clue why. I don't get any responses and go like a whole month and half without talking to him and when he does respond, its a couple words and I won't get another response for another 3 weeks.

771,mentalhealth,1,"Interesting how mental illness can make you adapt and surprising skills that I've acquired, including ways to saving lives and making money. Anyone else experience this? I know, i know, some may say this is romanticism of mental illness but that's not my goal here. There's so many times that my health has nearly cost my life and negatively impacted those i love. I'm not discounting or negating that fact. 

However, i do want to acknowledge that everyone has strengths and the experiences we go through can cause for some interesting and surprising adaptations for us to survive in the world that on occasion may provide an advantage from time to time. So no, not romanticism, just adaptive learning that many haven't grown a skill for. 

For example, my diagnoses in order of when i got them between the ages of 23 to 34 and now 35 fyi... Anxiety, depression, bipolar, panic disorder, adhd, ptsd and autism (Aspergers). So, some particular ""flavors"" or ""traits"" that it shows is that when i do something, that's all that i do. Doesn't matter if it's positive like cooking, sewing, working, contacting people or sabotaging behavior like watching videos in bed when i need to start my day, spending money i don't have or playing games when i should be working/cleaning. The end result is chronic disorganization and many things (and often people) get pushed aside. So, most of my life I've lived in mild to moderate hoarding conditions. Yes, this has and still has negative impacts on my life, no denial there. 

But there's an interesting fact i noticed...

What do people who have hoarding behaviors have in common with pecan pickers?

They are able to step lightly so they don't break what they find valuable and look at the small details of a pile to find what they want inexplicably faster than most people. So, i was laid off my job and needed some cash for Christmas. I live in a part of the country that buys pecans wholesale from growers and the public which usually pays 3× or more what collecting cans does. It was already late in the season with only about 3 weeks of a 3 month season left. My mom owns about 5 mature pecan trees and i got permission to pick in her neighbor's yard while he was gone. In that amount of time with very little day light (i can't ever get out of bed before noon) with a rake, leaf blower and a couple storage bins, i picked over 200 lbs by myself. Most people do that over the entire season. So, i was able to pay my phone bill and get gas money so i could do other gigs while waiting for more work to come it.

I also have used my lack of selective attention and hyperfocus to produce alot of sewing projects. I made my winter wardobe one year in one day. Also, i even turned some of my ""negative"" flavors of binging YouTube into saving the lives of kittens and prevented a kidnapping for someone else (don't recommend. Please learn to stay alert of your surroundings at all times and know how-to describe your location quickly and accurately at all times. Something i learned from work. Long story)  
Also, since i have attention and memory problems, i have learned to never rely on memory at all. So i have gotten really good at using google products, namely google docs. So i can send my resume on command, remember important medical info for myself or animals, be able to reference facts people told me etc. The way it has helped me the most was being the sole witness to a car accident. I knew the police weren't going to come since it was a busy weekend. So i wrote down what i saw and google docs has a time stamp. Now the poor guy has to go to court and i don't have to live with the anxiety of some dumbass hot shot lawyer being all abelist in my face and cause the jury to doubt me/question my memory.

778,mentalhealth,1,"Diagnosed Today (in addition to BPD dx X 15 years), Weird Mania, and Low Sex Drive Hi everyone. I made a throwaway for this, but am active on Reddit.

I am a 35F who has had a Borderline diagnosis for 15 years. Today, I was also diagnosed with Bipolar tendencies. The last time I was manic was about 8-10 years ago when I obsessively played WoW for about a year with little sleep and not much care for anything. If you want to laugh along with me (because it's sort of funny, and humor is the only thing getting me through this), my current bout of mania is being hyperfocused on knitting. My kids are taking care of, but I am choosing to knit over cleaning the house, personal hygiene, sleep, and even work at times. I'm slightly sad about this revelation because I've been knitting since I was 7, but I recently decided to turn it into a business. I've made a little money, but more importantly, I have made friends, real ones, for the first time in my adult life. I have self-confidence I never had before, and I was feeling really good about everything, especially since I only work from home, and the idea of starting a business was really exciting. Now that it seems it's just a bout of mania, it's a bit of a punch in the gut. My doctor says if I can learn balance, I can continue on, which is a relief because knitting is something I have always loved. I didn't even realize it was becoming a ""problem"" until recently, and when my psychiatrist started to mention the diagnosis today, I was upset, though agreed, something was definitely ""off.""

Anyhow, now that we're done laughing at the fact I have the strangest mania obsession ever and I clearly must also be 80-years-old (hello Borderline, I usually age slide into my teens, but maybe I've slid into geriatrics?), I have a real-life issue. I have a low sex drive. I have two young kids (3 and 4) but I don't think it's because of them. Me and my partner get time alone, and I just have zero interest most of the time. I can go months and not care. Once we start, I'm into it, but I want to want it (I hope that makes sense). I am on Cipralex, Topiramate, and Seroquel, and am about to add Lithium. Is there anything I can do to want to have sex, other than just doing it? My partner isn't pressuring me at all. But I want to do it for them, and also for me (please don't turn this into something it isn't - no one is forcing me, and I don't think there is an expectation. I just recognize that sex was a healthy part of our relationship, and I miss it and would like it back, but I also don't love doing it when I'm not particularly in the mood).",diagnosed today addition bpd dx x year weird mania low sex drive hi throwaway active f borderline diagnosis year today diagnosed bipolar tendency time manic year ago obsessively played wow year little sleep care want laugh s sort funny humor thing getting current bout mania hyperfocused knitting kid taking care choosing knit cleaning house personal hygiene sleep work time m slightly sad revelation knitting recently decided turn business little money importantly friend real one time adult life self confidence feeling really good especially work home idea starting business really exciting s just bout mania s bit punch gut doctor say learn balance continue relief knitting loved didn t realize problem recently psychiatrist started mention diagnosis today upset agreed definitely laughing fact strangest mania obsession clearly year old hello borderline usually age slide teen maybe slid geriatrics real life issue low sex drive young kid don t think s partner time just zero time month care start m want want hope make sense cipralex topiramate seroquel add lithium want sex just doing partner isn t pressuring want don t turn isn t forcing don t think expectation just recognize sex healthy relationship miss like don t love doing m particularly mood
779,mentalhealth,1,"i barely know at this point (EDIT: sorry about my name i made this account without expecting someone to see it) i’m a 16 year old boy. i’ve been extremely mixed up and feeling like my actions are out of my control or even my own thought process. if i’m being quite honest it feels like i don’t think. there’s a lot of other things that have been getting me down and my trouble is that i can’t remember any of it. my “memory” at this point feels like a cloud of static that only holds thought for a couple seconds then it just drifts away. i’ve been thinking about dissociative disorder cause i don’t feel me as a presence, i feel like a pair of eyes and ears. i’ve kinda lost the ability to laugh, or find things funny really and if i do there’s no laugh noise it’s fuckin with me. OCD has been big on my mind, i think i’ve always had it but at a young age i never acknowledged behaviors as something other than basic human functions. man lemme just spit out some shit that goes on with me/ random involuntary spasms and twitches(small magnitudes)/ recently an unkempt flurry of emotions from varying sources but primarily stress about my job caused me to punch a wall and fracture my hand(or something i don’t have insurance so no professional evaluation or surgery). part of that is that i bottle up A LOT. like this boy doesn’t want to be a nuisance in anyway i want to help and not throw my emotions at people, but lately it’s more just been an i guess unconditional fear of speaking my emotions/ “intrusive thoughts” whatever part of my inner self i’m still in touch with will berate me any chance it gets. i have a lot of random thoughts about being killed, or delusions(in general) that the person kind of walking in my direction not making any eye contact holding a bag of groceries is about to murder me/probably having some generalized anxiety, feels a good bit like what it sounds like but social anxiety specifically is more probably more present. i’m almost never comfortable around people and (regardless of who’s around) constantly feeling like somethings wrong like i’m doing something wrong. although i follow the mindset of not caring what others think and try to keep in mind that their thoughts don’t affect me, anxiety remains a strong force in my life. it cuts through me it really comes with a lot of pain and backlash from myself. the anxious feeling causes my spasms to increase, i’ll avoid the pain of talking and looking at people.//. BASICALLY i can’t isolate one disorder, illness or straight up delusion. my life really just consists of confusion, pain and numb disconnection and it’s pushing me a bit. i feel like i lost who i am, like there was this person who was a little goofy but pretty great i miss the guy man. forgot i’m wrapping this up, i don’t have the resources to get an official evaluation. if anyone who read through the entirety of this(absolutely fucking thank you by the way you’re pretty great to be using your valuable time to read through my thoughts i appreciate and love you very much even if you just get a kick out reading peoples pleads for help) has anything to offer me i will take it i have no reservations for what that may be i don’t even know what i need or what to do what i should do i’m pretty lost lol. that being said an accurate trusted online mental health evaluation is probably a good place to start. maybe some meditation advice, methods that could assist me(i’ve practiced low level sensory deprivation meditation in the past, is that something i should go back to?). i don’t know what else i should or shouldn’t put here but i’ll try to remember to check back here. i’m sorry if it seems like i’m unthankful for your time i really am but i can’t think of many more words. ah fuck i’m just gonna post i’m sorry.

790,mentalhealth,1,"Did my therapist ""cure"" my nihilism? Perhaps it's too early to say.

I've always had a slight droning of nihilism in the background. Some air of meaninglesness. This wasn't depression either. It was a philosophical thing. I had a lack of faith in people. I saw the worst in them. I also struggled to come to terms with death, which caused some dissociation.

So first few sessions with him we dealt with my personal stuff. Big improvement. Then we had a session where I'd talk about this nihilism and phislohpical issues. He's been a therapist for decades and is well versed on philosophy.

So in that hour, I said my fears and he just gave some insights. And they.....clicked. idk, something just 'clicked' in my brain.

Immediately after I felt a sense of...peace. No more droning nihilism in the background. Everything felt a bit quieter and more at ease.

791,mentalhealth,1,"Just need feedback on my coping [Suicide trigger] Bear with me it's quite a long wrap around of a story.

Background story, 25 M, Bisexual but only out officially to a very select few, I was outed in high school but people quickly forgot because that's high school.

So, I don't really know how to start this so I'll do my best. My birthday was the 4th of November, the Thursday two weeks before my parents tried contacting my girlfriend several times throughout the day, me, being the stubborn optimist thought it was to surprise me for my 25th. I went about my day none the wiser, work, gym, Thursday grocery shop. My girlfriend was overly affectionate throughout the grocery shop, and I just thought she had a bad day.

Half an hour after we get home my dad (he lives 200 kms away) and my brother (almost 350 kms) arrive, unannounced at my house, and inform me, that my cousin who I grew up with, was extremely close with, who was my first ally when I was outed as bisexual, committed suicide. Even now, I have not actually said the words out loud, even though I carried him to the hearse.

Lately, and when I mean lately, I mean almost every night since the 24th of October, I have had trouble sleeping, if I don't have a couple of alcoholic beverages, I struggle to get any decent sleep, which I don't like, considering I'm a PT and prided myself on being healthy and strong. My father told me to suck it up and that his parents were doing it worse, so I guess I've bottled it all inside, and it's cracking through, breaking down on boxing day, lack of sleep, irritability. 

I think about death a lot, but I do not want to die, however it's the unbearable dread of the notion, and the feeling of why did he die, when me myself, of the same age am still here? Is it fair if I was to succeed in life where he is no longer with us? He mentioned he wanted to speak to someone but was scared they'd take his guns away, which at this point i wish he did.

We swore after our grandfather died ""of a broken heart"" that we would always be there for each other  but i failed him and its ripping me apart inside. The guilt is suffocating.

I'm fearful of seeking help as I don't want to be seen as at risk. I do not want to harm myself. At all. I'm just not sure how to feel, or if my suppression is helping me move on or make me more bitter. 

Can anyone reflect on this?",just need feedback coping suicide trigger bear s quite long wrap story background story m bisexual officially select outed high school people quickly forgot s high school don t really know start ll best birthday th november thursday week parent tried contacting girlfriend time day stubborn optimist thought surprise th went day wiser work gym thursday grocery shop girlfriend overly affectionate grocery shop just thought bad day half hour home dad life km away brother km arrive unannounced house inform cousin grew extremely close ally outed bisexual committed suicide actually said word loud carried hearse lately mean lately mean night th october trouble sleeping don t couple alcoholic beverage struggle decent sleep don t like considering m pt prided healthy strong father told suck parent doing worse guess bottled inside s cracking breaking boxing day lack sleep irritability think death lot want die s unbearable dread notion feeling did die age fair succeed life longer mentioned wanted speak scared d gun away point wish did swore grandfather died broken heart failed ripping apart inside guilt suffocating m fearful seeking help don t want seen risk want harm m just sure feel suppression helping make bitter reflect

793,mentalhealth,1,"Hopefully I can finally tell someone someone about my problems and worries I just arranged a meeting with my doctor, and I'm really hoping I can finally talk about this stuff.  
  
I've been generally sad for a long time now. I spend all my time sleeping, or distracting myself on the internet, so I won't start thinking about my many failures.     
I just graduated gymnasium last summer, and the plan was to get a job and earn some money this year before university, but I have barely been able to drag myself out of bed - nevermind writing job applications.    
I'm constantly exhausted, never feel up to anything that doesn't make me immediately happy (very few things do), spend several hours a week feeling sad just thinking about how I can't get myself to do anything productive.   
On my birthday last week, I had arranged for my friends to come over for a casual celebration, but when the day arrived, I wanted nothing more than to lay down and let the day go by. My parents kept pushing me to help prepare the food and stuff, but I just felt so mentally exhausted.    
   
I really, really want to talk to someone. I can't exactly diagnose myself - I just keep thinking ""I may be feeling bad, but I don't know how far it has to go actually be anything"".  
I can't tell anyone how worried I am about it. 
I've tried talking to my parents about some of the things, like how I can't make myself do anything, or how I'm always tired, but they just keep telling me stuff like ""that's because you spend all day in bed"", which, of course, might be correct, but once I combine it with the near constant sadness, I'm worried it might be something deeper.  
I know they would probably listen if I could just tell them everything, but I can't, and they haven't been connecting the signs I have been able to give off.   
   
Luckily (or unluckily, depending on the angle), I've been feeling nauseous a lot these past few weeks, and it seems connected to the constant exhaustion, so it works as an excuse to speak to my doctor, and hopefully get close enough on topic for me to talk about it all without having to bring it up out of nowhere.   
  
If I could only tell someone ""Hey, I don't think I'm doing too well"", I could have gotten this over with months ago, instead of sitting around hoping for my chance like this.   
I know I need help, so why can I still not convince myself, that my problems are worth helping enough to ask.

800,mentalhealth,1,"Periods of extreme sensitivity... is this a mental health issue? So what I’m referring to is kind of like PMS times 10. It’s definitely not PMS because 

1. I’m on birth control and don’t get my period anymore

2. I experienced this separate from PMS when I had periods 

3. It lasts for like a few weeks at a time then returns many months later

I’ll go from fatigued and unable to focus, to smiling and cuddly, to bawling my eyes out to irritated by anything and everything in short periods of time with little to no trigger.

I cried over a meme featuring a grimes song this morning and I don’t even like grimes and the meme wasn’t funny.

My boyfriend keeps telling me I’ve been super energetic lately, and I have been around him. I can’t keep my hands off him or my mouth shut. I keep rambling on and on and squeezing him like a stuffed bear.

I smacked him in the face the other day for NO reason. I just got upset and smacked him. He said or did nothing wrong. 

At work I get nothing done because I can’t focus. I’m either too tired and fatigued to do anything other than stare blankly at the screen, or so excited about something I just thought of that I have to go google it.

Is hypersensitivity like this normal? A symptom of a mental health issue? Something I should seek help for?

I know it’s not bipolar, I have friends with bipolar and that seems VERY different from what I’m experiencing.

Instead of shifts between mania and depression I seem to shift between normal and emotional wreck.

803,mentalhealth,1,"I'm afraid to seek help (Long Post) Forgive me because this might be a long post for a first time Redditor like me. I've been looking for sites where I could write my story. A friend introduced me to Reddit to browse memes (so if he read this I might drop out) instead of other websites. I haven't really used it since I downloaded it so here's like my first interaction with this.  


Just like the title suggest, I'm afraid to seek help. Well, as much as possible I would like to be anonymous but I don't know how to keep anonymity in Reddit. I also don't tell others my problems in person just like in social media.  Currently, I had already deactivated most of my social media accounts tho, except Instagram, although I don't open it as much as I did and archived thousand of my posts...  


One of my problems is that I forget what they are. So I'm often left sad without any reason why I'm just sad. It started when I was younger at the peak of my puberty where I'm too anxious about everything I do and when I did something that is considered embarrassing for me but normal for others, I imagine there's a vault of memories on the back of my head where I store all my ""bad memories"" and forget them. Looking back, I used to ""open"" it and just remember all the embarrassing things I did, well I don't remember why. Then it came a time where I couldn't open that vault and it takes all my mem'ries, the ""good"" and the ""bad"". I think it took a toll on my emotions as I grew up.  


So I'm already 18 and recently came out to my parents. Well, I thought they fuuullyy accepted me and told me they were open-minded and was fine with it. About my sexuality, hmm. I don't know how to tell you the entirety of it because I'm really new to it too because I recently (well years ago tho, like 2-3) decided to think about it. So basically I was so straight (acting like one though) but I thought it was natural, I grew up like it and thinking I was straight so I thought I was tho. But you know, this is sooo new to me, the lingo, actions, everything! So when my parents asked me to explain, I really don't know the answer. So back to my parents, a day after I opened up to them, my mom called me and asked me a series of questions and lecturing me about what a bad decision this was. Although I was quiet the whole time, a little teary-eyed (I don't want to show her I was crying because it would show that I was weak and am not ready to make that decision) so with all my power within me I stopped my myself from crying and my voice from quivering. Then I said, ""Why are you like this to me? I opened up to my friends and classmates and they treated me the same as if nothing has happened. You're supposed to be the one who should understand me first before them."" then she answered this and it was too intense I went to my room, ""You've become gayer. How would we understand if you don't tell us."" (I forgot to mention that they said ""they already knew"" when I came out""). Then the next day after that, whilst I was having my brunch (It was a Saturday) she went to sit with me on the table and talked with me (Again, it was more of a one-sided conversation as I stayed quiet the whole time).  She said this, ""About the thing, you said to us the other day, you're dad was really disappointed because he has hopes for you. He would understand and accept you sooner, just give him time.""  


Fast forward, my mom's **changed**. We used to be extremely religious (Roman Catholic), I grew up praying the Rosary every night while kneeling down (oftentimes, seiza style). So as I grew up I have learned a lot and of course, in our generation, there is an answer to almost all questions with the use of your phone. I have kept myself but I don't think I could call myself religious, tho I love and respect all religions (I think that is when I started to take a step back to mine). So yeah like I said earlier, she has somewhat changed. Although she prays before going to work, now she does these rituals. I'm not used to sudden changes to I called her out while we're eating dinner. ""Why are you doing this? This is all just a scam or fakery (I don't know the proper term), who do you really believe in? We're Catholics, we're supposed to believe in one God. (I know this part became a little religious, I'm sorry guys, please bear with me) Technically, there is no ""God"" in your rituals so who do you do ""it"" for? Please stop this already."" So that escalated weeks later, I was taking an afternoon nap 'cause why not? It's the weekend. She called me to her room and told me, ""You, (my name), stop with your negativity! You're ruining this for me and for the energy coming in this house! I'm not doing this just for me but for us family!"" (It's too long I forgot the rest) So I was tired and still dazed because I just woke up so I said, ""I don't want to talk about this right now, I'm going back to my room."" While walking back to my room she was shouting, ""Come back here! I am not done talking with you!"" So I was lying on my bed my sister walked into my room looking for something, a charger maybe. Then my mom busted through the door with flaming eyes and shouting, (I forgot most of it because like I was, I was sleepy all my emotions are turned off that time and my sister was still at my room and now stuck in the situation). So she pulled my blanket but could only pull half of it as I was holding the other end. So when she realized that she let go and started pointing at me (I was pulling back my blanket at the time)  


""You've been too much for this family! You think you're so smart, you're not! You have not contributed anything yet you're so boastful! Demon! When you came out we accepted you and you're still like this!"" (My sister doesn't know I came out, well that saved me the trouble) She called me a lot of nasty things which I couldn't translate, but she called me a Demon several times, and for me who grew up religious that is something for me. So when that happened, I officially became the black sheep of the family **\*applause**\*  


Writing this is mentally draining because it takes effort to remember stuff accurately. Are you still here with me?  


This happened weeks ago and as of now, she speaks to me in a soft tone. Well I know she's doing that to forgive her, well I don't? Well, I'm doing all my duties as their eldest although there's really no feelings left. I don't think I could recover from this, I have already considered myself as dirt and demon as they have suggested.  


I grew up having only myself to support me. I cried extremely silently if they ever caught me, I'd get ""lovely beating"" because **men shouldn't cry**. I have only publicly cried in front of my previous adviser when I lost my phone and in front of my previous professor. It really takes effort to keep composure is not? I literally have no one to tell my feelings, problems, and rants. I don't have anyone to lash out, I'm just by myself. I have a lot of friends though, but we're not on the level to tell our problems.  


So in my class, I joined this clique (one of their ""leader"" or member was kicked out and I think they were looking for replacements so I was that one but I drag along a friend so it's not hard for me to adjust) They used to gossip and make fun about me when the classes just started because of my hair. At that time I was growing my hair because I shaved my head the previous year (at the time it was my way to vent? It's crazy I know that is why I grew it out) So when I grew it out, it was ugly, I know! It's all spiky mohawk like spiky. They called me names like McSundae and Spiky (like the name of a dog). I'm extremely receptive, even though I was erasing the writings on the board, I could hear them clearly and see their reflection through the glass board. I may be ambivert but I'm not a dumb one. I never confronted them about this until I joined their clique and admitted that I knew from the start. Then after I joined their clique, a few weeks (maybe months) have passed and I started to smell bad! Like bad-bad! I couldn't stop or control it, I used products to stop it but all failed. It's because my anxiety came back (well I was not diagnosed but it is what it is) then I heard whispers again and they started picking on me again jokingly this time, but I knooow. It's gone now though, I'm really glad. Until now they didn't know that I knew.  


In the clique, this was this girl that I got close to and I thought I could trust her. But now the others are teasing her with a boy who used to blatantly bully me the previous years. Of course, I don't want to ruin our friendship and their growing romance so I don't tell her that he used to hurt me. Then my only escape, my friend, was gone. I couldn't trust her anymore, well maybe I do, but I don't know. I don't want to interact with anyone who's affiliated with that boy.  


So last year, my friend wants me to introduce myself to the school guidance counselor which helped him and two others from our class. So one day I said yes, but when we came to her office I chickened out. Luckily there was a research convention in our school at the time and she wanted to come and I used that to get out of there but I went with her and got to know her a little. She was really kind and extremely intelligent! She gave me her one and only chocolate. I'm embarrassed to talk with her again, I really want to but I can't it's too embarrassing to tell her this story of mine.  


I am not suicidal (yet I think) but there's always a thought in my head that I want to do it but I don't (confusing? a'ight) If only if I decided to do it, I want to do it quickly with no pain. Again, it's just a thought. I'm afraid to seek professional help because I'm afraid of the truth (that I might be depressed). I don't want to open up to my friends because I know they have problems too, I really do, they had told me and I listened. I feel like they'd laugh at me or something like that and think ""Just because of that you're like that?"". This is my form of venting out. It feels so great doing this. If you finished this, daaamn!

I have depression but haven't had a phase for like 2-3 years. i never got any medications for it or went to a therapist. 

My guess is am just so love-deprived that it causes these urges. I do have a family which i do dislike and never get any appreciation and not really from anywhere else.

I've had two relationships so far, my first GF was emotionally abusive and i broke up when i noticed i didn't enjoy the relationship. My second relationship was really great i loved her to the core of my heart. Well also this relationship ended because she realized we didn't fit together after like one and a half years and only because she never told me anything that bothered her, i thought i was always encouraging to share everything with eachother because talking to each other is the most important thing. She broke then up rather suddenly via text and now i see we didnt fit well enough and we had some problems, but it took a lot from me and i have trust issues ever since.

Ever since i never had a relationship because i don't want to get to know other girls because i am afraid of getting hurt.

807,mentalhealth,1,"I feel so alone First off, I don't feel any suicidal thoughts, I just want to make that clear, I don't want to make anybody worried. 

I feel so alone. This is my fourth I think mental breakdown of January, and things just seem to get worse. I feel like my friends aren't there for me, all of them seem to be in a relationship or in a good friendship and I am just in the background. The people I really want to hang out don't seem to care about whether I am there or not. This is even harder to cope with since I am still in the closet. All of them are Christian, I am most likely the gay one out of all of them, this makes it so so so hard to hang out with the people I want to hang with, and even tougher to be in a relationship. And It makes it even worse when I see people all around me happy with people who actually give a shit whether they are going to make to the event or not, or whether everything is doing alright with them. On my social media feeds, I see happy couples, doing things couples would do, and deep deep down, there is a part of me that knows that I may never get that. Then I see the gays, some closeted some not. The ones who or not, happily being them, being who they really are and I am terrified of what people will think of me. I can't be girly, I can't hang out with the people I really want to,  I just can't do it. I barely hang out with anybody, since I am homeschooled, I don't go to public school so I don't see people that I would call my friends on a daily basis. I feel secluded in my room, typing this, tears running down my face, rather than talking to a close friend. My school work piles on me constantly, I am always finishing things at the last minute and I never really get the weekend off. I have anxiety and social anxiety so I find it hard to go out in public to try and build friendships with people. And even when I do, it's next to impossible, I just can't relate to them, I don't see them as often, I honestly don't know much about them, and they are most likely a boy and I really can't relate to things they do or say. I just feel like everything is stacked against me, no social life, the fact that I am homeschooled, restricting how much I get out of the house, my anxiety, being gay and wanting a relationship and not being able to truly express myself, and that limiting me in pretty much everything I do. My life just feels like a checklist, my mom has everything planned out for me in high school, and is expecting me to go to college, but what I really want to do for a living is to be on youtube or twitch, doing the things I love, and having a loving and supporting community, which I could really use in times like these. And with no one to vent to, everything stays bottled up and I move on and do this all over again.

815,mentalhealth,1,"Severly struggling and unmedicated for 8 years Hey y'all. This is my first post on here so I apologize if I break any rules. I did read them to be safe but I just wanted to throw that in just in case.

I am a 36 year old woman who has had 3 children. My oldest (may my sweet girl RIP) would have been 19 next march and my youngest just turned 12. I did not have very many symptoms until after I had my first Angel but they really hit hard and all at one time. Also, she passed away st 6 weeks old which is pain I will never stop feeling. I have just learned to do the best I can but there is no way to ever not feel the loss of a child IMO. About 2 years after she was born, (she had passed a year and 8 months before this as well) I  was diagnosed with Bipolar type 1, Schizo effective disorder and severe GAD. It was vary hard dealing with those and being a new mom of an Angel and I always prayed it was severe PPD and depression from burying my babygirl and it would go away but sadly that didn't happen.

I do feel blessed that I have never had severe issues with the Schizo effective effective disorder like many other have to deal with. For many years, it was just  auditory hillusinations and paranoia where I always think people are staring and talking about me but for the past 5 years or so, the voice (its always been just the one male voice but the things he says are beyond terrible. (I would imagine anyone who suffers with any form of hallucinations, especially visual ones. That would horrify me) about 5 or so years ago it seemed like all three of my diagnoses became 1,000 times more severe at the same time and I have no idea why.

OK want to add that I am a heroin addict who has been in recovery for 8 years now which I sure has to have something to do with it but why didn't it start until after 3 years of sobriety? I take 1200 mg of Lithium a day, They upped my Depekote from 250 mg to 500 mg extended release and also put me on 2 mg of Klonopin 3 times a day but haven't had them since I moved from NY in 2012.  nothing is getting better and I am so lost and feel so hopeless and have no idea what to do! I am uninsured so I go to a clinic that has sliding scale fees and normally they are still very good doctors but sadly the only I see now doesn't listen to me at all. For months I have stayed in a bad anxious state where I just know something is really wrong but don't know what is and can never figure out what it is and the panic attacks have become so severe that I have called the EMTs at least 10 times in a month. Last week I Passed out from a a panic attack and the EMTs that come every single time I call, made me go to the hospital but after Trying on 4 different BP machines including a manual one, my BP stayes so high that none couls get a reading. The hospital is 30 mons away and it wast until halfway there and even at that poont, the bottom number was 133 which is beyond stroke level. Even though I have felt the same feeling for over 16 years, each one is still  terrifying because of how fast my heart rate gets and how high my blood pressure gets. I have barely slept on months because the voice has gotten so loud and so constant that it keeps me awake. If there are any Supernatural fans in here, it feels so much like what Sam went through when Cas broke down the wall in his brain making him go insane from his time in the Cage and he was constantly Hallucinating that Luci was with him st all times, singing or throwing those poppers on the ground all night which caused him to almost doe from lack of sleep. 

I am honestly not sure why exactly I am posting this but K just got such a strong urge to vent to people who truly understand. My husband is the only person I have who is by my side all all times and doesn't say rude and hurtful shit like I am just being dramatic and overreacting and I should be a strong enough person to not panic.

New here.

I have a depression and I am autistic (aspergers), and I have recently decided to share my journey with other people. About how I deal with things (or not) and how I am going to deal with things, how I am (going to be) fighting my depression, and maybe in the process of this all, hopefully be able to not just help myself by talking about these things, but also help other people with simillar issues, or even just give them the courage to talk to someone or get help.

My first video of the year I am just explaining some things about me, where I have been and where I want to go.

But I will be creating more video's (not just about these two subjects) about depression and autism.

Hope you guys and girls appreciate what I am trying to do here, and maybe take the time to watch my video and give me some things to talk about, like, what you want ""regular""/healthy people to know and be made aware of, or just say hi to me and to support me on this.  


You can check out my 1st video on this here: [Starting Over](https://youtu.be/3SJ_ETaxo9c)

825,mentalhealth,1,"I have a lot of confusion on my identity, who I am and how to manage my mind (Long post) As strange as it sounds I have struggled for the past decade with who I am and what my personality is. 

I have developed social anxiety over the years and I've seen there are mental techniques that help me deal with it (i.e focusing my attention outwards/ or actively changing my thoughts). Over the years I've come across many different techniques/ ways of thinking that make me more able to deal with anxiety and the stresses of life. The issue is whenever I adopt a new technique it feels as though i'm a different person. I feel a distinct difference in myself and my thinking everytime a new technique is used. The change is so noticeable to me that I refer to them as different personalities because of how different I feel and think whenever I shift from one technique to another. 

There are other examples of different techniques that i am using such as: faking confidence, trying to find the humor in things and life, thinking more positively, trying to be more talkative, forcing myself to have more energy, trying to enjoy social situations more, forcing myself to concentrate on the outside world so i dont miss something out, trying to put myself in the shoes of someone else so i can see where they are coming from and there are a few others too that i have experimented on throughout the years. 

​

The change in me feels so strong that even my interests change depending on which technique I use, my skill in certain tasks such as video games (I quite like the video game Fifa and I notice I am far better at it when I use one personality/technique vs when I use another, to the point other people have even stated it's like they're playing against another player, further adding to my belief that each technique is distinct and has it's own strengths and weaknesses. 

My video game online multiplayer record would also change, I could be in one personality/ way of thinking for a few days and notice I am winning a lot of my online games consistently however for one reason or another I would change my thinking technique/ personality and then I can see a noticable difference in how I play. My play style changes and as a result my win/ loss ratio also changes. I would begin to lose many of my online games then. If i wanted to start winning again i would just change the technique my mind is using into one i know which is better at the game. 

This doesn't just happen with online gaming, this effects pretty much every aspect of my life: the shows i am interested in, my hobbies, taste in music, people i am attracted to, career aspirations etc. 

I notice my friendships/ relationships change depending on which personality/ technique I have. For example I could be talking with my brother and see that the personality I am in/ the technique i am using doesnt gel that well worth my brother, so I change my personality to one I know has a better connection with him. In the past i've even categorised which personality works with which person. This became quite confusing though however when I would be in a situation where I would be interacting with multiple people and where i've categorised one person preferring one personality and the other person preffering another. it could get to the point where I would switch my personality mid conversation according to who was talking. As you could imagine, that was extremeley confusing for me and lead to me withdrawing from many many social situations. In all honesty i've become more of a recluse as time has gone on because socialising became such a drain for me to do. 

​

For many years I was jumping from technique to technique or personality to personality but all the confusion and feeling like I wasnt the same person as I was at the start of the day as I was to the end of the day was very difficult to deal with for me. I began having strange fantasies of suicide just so I didn't have to deal with this anymore (just to clarify none of them were serious thoughts, I just thought about them when I was low because that was one way out of this mental pain I was going through). 

​

Anyway so I thought screw it all and screw the techniques, I'm just going to let myself be. I'm just going to let my mind be it's natural self and not try and change it so at least I can feel like the same person day in day out rather than chopping and changing all the time. I wanted to have my relationships mean something and i wanted the accomplishments i have made to feel like i had made them, not some other version of me. 

​

So i kept it as a rule to just let myself be, not change my personality and to try and be myself. When doing this i felt more natural and more like my genuine self. Like i wasn't trying to be something else and i could just let myself be. I've been trying to do this now for the past 4 or 5 years however i've been finding it difficult as I would get really anxious and my mind/ thoughts would get away from me. Without using the techniques the anxiety builds up and i start feeling so low and even paranoid that I feel I just have to change my personality to deal with the stresses of life. I got to the point where i would last around a month or two without shifting or changing the techniques i used/ the personality i am in, but i would get quite down and more and more anxious as time would go on. 

​

This inevitabley lead me to changing my approach/ personality several times just so i could feel calm again. Every time i changed the technique i was in, it feels like pressing a reset button and all the events/ situations that took place in the past personality were meaningless as it was a different ""me"" living through them. 

​

I have struggled to hold a job down becuase i simply cannot decide which personality/ technique to stick with. I believe i preform to an addequate standard when i have a job, however because i keep changing my personality i struggle with any long term commitments. I recently had to leave a well paying job because i simply could not handle the anxiety. 

​

I recently discovered meditation and i like the concept of developing a seperation from your own thoughts/ feelings, that you can just observe them and not get too attached to them. Using this approach/ technique i feel calmer in general and dont wake up feeling sick from my anxious thoughts anymore. However the same issue arises in me, i feel as though it's just another technique. I don't really feel genuine/ natural when using this approach in my day to day life. It's like there is my base self and i have to attach a technique in order to feel okay in my regular day to day activities. I just don't feel natural when using a technique. Another issue is i find it quite draining having a techanique being played in the back of my mind 24/7. I've read the human brain uses about 25% or your bodies resources and i add more pressure onto it by having a constant technique playing in the background as well. 

​

I felt like meditation would have been the answer but it kind of just feels like another technique that although helpful, makes me feel unnatural and disingenious. 

So i often think i can't win if i let myself be and just try and be natural becuase i get anxious stressed easily, but i can't use different techniques because they just make me feel like i am not being my true self. 

​

I know this is a very strange post and i appreciate if you have read it all, my writing style isn't the best and thanks for sticking it out to read it all. The weird thing is i would have wrote this completely differently if i were using a different technique/ in a different personality. 

​

I just want to know if anyone has any advice or if has any knowledge of a feeling like this. I thought this could be linked to a disorder called dissociative identity disorder, previously known as multiple personality disorder, but after seeing around 6 or 7 different therapist/ councellors over the last few years they have ruled this out. 

​

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

826,mentalhealth,1,"Need advice on how to get rid of perfectionism Im currently at my lowest moment as of now. I just had a mental breakdown in front of my teacher and a couple of my friends. They were so nice to calm me down, but i really felt as if everything i did was out of my control.

Basically i went on a fit of rage due to me not being able to get signatures from my teachers for my research papers, i had searched on every nook and cranny of my school only to be told that they were away on an important meeting. At the same time one of the teachers had mention that you need to include one more page naming the teachers that had examined my team at the presentation last sunday. I didn't have that page, while the paper had to be collected today

I don't blame them AT ALL, i knew that i should've finished my research papers a day before it was collected. In which case i could've done small revisions. However my research paper was done on the day it was supposed to be collected, so no window of time was available to us to revise or edit a few things. 

And then IT happened, the stress built up to the point i was unable to handle it, i was absolutely frustrated at myself, the only reason this research paper wasn't going to get a perfect score is due to a few minor mistakes that could've been cleaned up easily a day prior.

I was able to calm myself down, but not in a good way. Basically, in a fit of rage i punched the wall multiple times until i calmed down, i usually do this so the shock of the punch would in some way negate the anger and dissapointment i felt. I know and fully understand that it's unhealthy, but as of now, i really don't know any alternatives.

The teacher later stopped me and told to not hurt yourself, but i just felt like it was somewhat a reminder not to make another stupid mistake.

I really hate this perfectionist motto that somehow im living by. While i am considered an overachiever at school, most of my other friends that are equally if not more intelligent than me never had gone into this state of mania. I just really want to get rid of this THING and i would love advice on how to handle and let go of mistakes.

Because most of the time, when i try to let go, i keep convincing myself that every moment is an opportunity, and its either you don't do it, or you do it with the pretense that failure is not an option.

I really want to become better and especially happier this year, and these last few days weren't any better. I have never been to a psychiatrist so my condition had never been diagnosed. Is it necesarry though? Because i had gone to counseling with my teacher at school.

I dont know if how my friends would accept me now, knowing my ill condition. And especially i dont want to end up hurting anybody else. So im in dire need of advice on how to control oneself

827,mentalhealth,1,"Silence &amp; therapy Helo me understand, please. Why do therapists love silence?

After reading in r/psychotherapy, I found out many therapists have no problem with silence. They think it's a good thing, it 'gives us time away from the chaos' or such bullshit.

The thing is, all the silence made me VERY uncomfortable. My depression worsened BECAUSE of the silence. I was paying precious money just to be ignored. My silence was not a sign I needed silence, but a sign I need help in speaking. Yet I keep hearing how good silence is.

832,mentalhealth,1,"Suicidal over my low self-esteem, appearance, social anxiety, dating, and life as a whole Hello everyone, I'm a 19 year old male who has for his entire life dealt with social anxiety depression suicidal thoughts low self-esteem and a whole other list of things. I have never had many friends and that has always made me believe that I'm unlikable and boring and ugly (when I do it course try to get the courage to talk without my social anxiety get in the way) and people probably don't and never will give two shits about me. I have always absolutely hated my appearance cause I'm a little chubby in my stomach and my face jawline isn't good and my teeth are badly crooked as I'm in the process of jaw surgery to widen my upper jaw for braces (which has created a huge gap in my upper teeth) and then a year from now I'm having my bottom pulled forward. 

I'm currently trying to find a job after all this jaw and teeth bullshit is over and I'm trying to figure out my career since I'm done high school but it's difficult I'm just really feeling pretty low of all the stuff and chaos going on. But tbh a lot of this has to still do with my appearance. I truly feel worthless because of how I look especially if I'm beside a good looking person I feel I shouldn't even exist or I'm not worthy of trying to approach girls especially the ones I find really attractive. (I have really considered going to the gym just waiting for my surgery to heal first.) All this has grew to suicidal thoughts. 

I truly honestly believe I would be better off dead cause nobody really knows who I am or anything and I would most certainly not be missed by people if I ended up dead or just decided to disappeared it would make little to no difference cause they would forget about me in a month anyway and this is not something I feel like putting up with because to me, it's no way for myself to live plus I feel undeserving of a life as a human to begin with.

 I get really emotional and really cry some days thinking about all this and I just personally feel like just sitting in my bed nice and warm drowning in my tears cause it's just so goddamn comfortable and I feel like if I just played video games I don't have to worry about people hating me or not wanting anything to do with me. I want and try isolating myself because I feel this way I know I'm doing people no harm and I can just slowly wither away into nothing and they never know or have to worry about me.

Long story short being a human is not meant for me. I seriously wish I was never a thing. I have never been at peace with my life as of now and

It's not like I make an impact anyways on earth or on people...Sorry for the really long rant..😔

833,mentalhealth,1,"In serious need of advice/perspective about my mental illnesses causing me to feel a new violent ""gross"" feeling due to my first kiss Hiya. I'm a woman age 21 and I am really confused. I wrote a lot of context about this issue, because I am having a really hard time with all of this, but if it’s too long to read I totally understand-- I titled the main issue at hand below so you can just skip to there if you would like. No matter how much you read, I really really appreciate it.

*Added a tl;dr at the end for both sections.*

CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT:

I wasn't interested in sex and relationships at all during my childhood and adolescence. When I first learned/ got the ""sex talk"" from my mom around age 8, I was repulsed by sex. It made me feel gross. This feeling, however, is not completely epitomized by the word gross. Thinking about sex made me feel so uncomfortable that I wanted to rip off my own skin. I felt absolutely awful. I never discussed these feelings with my mom, because I couldn't even say the word sex without my whole body cringing. Around this same time I was diagnosed with panic disorder {description of the illness, feel free to skip if you already know: Panic disorder focuses on having panic attacks; panic attacks are often caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain which triggers the fight or flight response when nothing is actually wrong. The main system symptom is extreme fear accompanied by some or all symptoms such as sweating, shaking, feeling dizzy and/or weak, heart/chest pain, as well as an inability to breathe. It is important to distinguish between those who have panic disorder and someone who has experienced one or few panic attacks. Many people may experience a panic attack in their lifetime, or perhaps something more accurately described as an anxiety attack as a panic attack is triggered by no particular reason. These people experience extreme anxiety as a result of a specific reason or incident. To be actually diagnosed with the disorder it has to affect everyday life}. My main triggers as a child were things like vomiting, blood, being in new/uncomfortable situations, and other things like that. I was really lucky in that my mom also has panic disorder so she recognized the signs. Most mental health disorders are diagnosed 8 to 10 years after the first major symptoms appear so I am really happy that my mom could help me with this so I didn't have to go through a super long period being afraid of fear. My mom took me to a therapist to talk about my problems and things began to get better. We established that I had obsessive compulsive tendencies and severe anxiety. After that I didn’t really think about sex and romantic relationships for a while.

At age 17 I was a senior in high school, and for the first time ever I became interested in sex. I began to think about sex more casually and it no longer gave me the ""gross"" feeling that I explained above. In fact, I started to want to have sex. Not in a crazy way, I just become open to the idea of having a relationship, falling in love, and having sex. Now I’m guessing I need to clarify that I like guys and I’m a girl. And to clarify even more I *really* like guys. Not in a boy crazy way, but I obsess over my favorite musicians, actors, and stuff like that. I also like romance dramas and movies. When I meet guys I don’t wanna jump them all or anything like that. I had no experience with guys really at all when I was 17. A guy had asked me out once (well the same guy asked me out three times over three years). The first time I said yes, but then he ignored me for a while and it was weird so I was like “okay I guess this is over.” It kind of just ended like that. The next time he asked me out I was 16 and it was a year later. I hadn’t talked to him in a while and I needed help with something a project and I needed it to be a guy so I asked him and he helped me. I had to drive him home and he turned off the music and started asking me all these serious questions like “how is your life? Are you doing okay now that your parents are divorced?” And other stuff like that. I just gave him some surface level answers and then dropped him off. This is when I felt that “gross” feeling again. I was really uncomfortable and upset. I avoided him and honestly never wanted to talk to him again. It was pretty easy to avoid him so I just kinda let it go saying that I just didn’t like him and then that was it.

After high school I went to a four year college right away. I was hoping to meet a guy, him become my boyfriend, fall in love, have sexy times, all that jazz. I remember trying to convince myself that I had crushes on guys when I didn’t really feel that way because my bitch ex-best friend at the time was super boy crazy and she had a crush on every guy she met. I also think another reason why I was trying so hard to have a crush on a boy was because I really wanted a boyfriend and to start my “sexual journey.” But unfortunately I never really felt that way about a guy so I didn’t really pursue anyone and no one ever pursued me either. My love life was nonexistent. After like 2/2.5 years of college I started to wonder why people even bothered with relationships-- not because I didn’t have a boyfriend and felt bitter though. I honestly just didn’t get it. It seemed like a lot of time to try to get along with someone. I also didn't have any close guy friends so I didn’t really know what it was like to have any kind of relationship with a guy other than my dad, my brother, and some nice coworkers.

Around this time I was having some issues with my mental health again. I regularly see a psychiatrist and take medication for my illnesses (I am very very pro-medication). One doctor visit, my psychiatrist broke the news that he had another diagnosis for me. In addition to the panic disorder, I have Borderline Personality Disorder {description of the illness, feel free to skip if you already know: BPD is a very difficult to diagnose disorder and is considered one of the most extreme and can be very difficult to treat. Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized as experiencing extreme fear of abandonment,  unstable relationships, distorted and often changing view of one’s self, explosive anger, recurring feelings of emptiness, anxiety, and depression.} Long story short this illness sucks so much and sometimes I get so angry that I can’t even think straight.

Anyway, when I started to wonder all these things, I went abroad to study for four months in South Korea and the whole time I was there I was much more occupied with all the great things I was doing so I wasn’t really thinking about boys or sex or that kind of stuff. I had such a great time in Korea! I learned a lot about myself. I realized that my bitch ex-best friend was indeed a bitch that made me hate myself and was super toxic. When I got home I dumped her ass (I actually cried a lot and was super sad. I’m just trying to make myself sound like a cool badass). I missed my brother and sister so much while I was away; I knew that I would because I am super close with both of them, but I was surprised because I actually missed my mom and dad too. My parents are a mess in so many ways, but me being away made them realize how much they depend on me and they started to be more appreciative towards me. I really learned to love myself and for the first time I can remember, despite all the trauma and horribly difficult obstacles I have had to face in my life, I was genuinely happy and I genuinely really liked myself.

THE MAIN ISSUE THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

Now cue the issue I am having that made so much of that happiness, confidence, and comfort go away. The fall 2019 semester (last semester) was the beginning of my last year of college. I was coming back from Korea so I was getting used to going to school in the US and seeing old friends. Two of my closest friends go to school out of state and I wasn’t friends with that bitch ex-best friend anymore so I was hanging out with different people. This is when a friend from a club I was in since the beginning of college reached out to me. (He is important to this story and I will just be referring to him as “Boy” through the rest of this post.) I met up with Boy and we had a great time. We are the same age but he graduated early. Right now he is doing freelance work in the film industry and he has a lot of free time. We started hanging out like once a week and I really enjoyed it.

He confessed to me that during the semester I was gone he got kicked out of our mutual club. I asked him why and he told me that he did something bad to a girl. I already knew Boy was a black-out drunk, but he told me at a party he was black-out drunk and he felt up a girl without her consent. He was clearly super beat-up about it and felt extremely remorseful. Boy is a super liberal guy and really doesn’t seem like the guy to do this sort of thing. Since I wasn’t there when it happened, it was really hard to believe it or even get a grasp on the situation. As someone who has been sexually harassed I before, I felt super conflicted about being his friend, but like I said I wasn’t here when it happened so it seemed pretty unbelievable to me. He told me he was going to group therapy and that he was having a tough time because he hated himself for what he had done.

After a while of hanging out I started to think that I might have a crush on him-- I really think this was because I wanted a boyfriend more than wanted him. I felt super guilty, because of what he had done to that girl, but it was hard to understand. After hanging out a bunch for like 2 months we were at his place watching a movie and he started to cuddle up with me. It was fine and I was telling myself that I liked it and that it something romantic was finally happening. After the movie we ended up in a weird state-- like the vibe was weird. He was being really touchy and kept hugging me awkwardly. At the time I kept telling myself I liked it. Thinking about it now while I’m writing this I feel super uncomfortable.

We hung out again next week and at first things were good as usual. We were going to my place to watch the sequel to the movie we watched last time. As soon as I turned it on he snuggled up against me and suddenly I felt painfully uncomfortable. I started thing things like “I don’t want to do this and I want to be somewhere else.” I told myself that I was just nervous. After I calmed myself down a little I started to get irritated thinking things like “this is boring. I’d rather be watching the show I’m binging right now, and why is he cuddling against me in the traditionally ‘girls position?’ If I could cuddle with a boy I would want to be the one hugging; this is just annoying.” His hair touched my face a bit and it felt course and I was disgusted. He touched my stomach a bit and I felt disgusted. Even though I know that was what I was feeling now, at the time I just brushed it off as being nervous. After watching the movie we were talking about all kinds of stuff. He hangs out with my bitch ex-best friend sometimes and that pisses me off because she did a lot of really horrible things to me and at some point that came up which just pissed me off again.

I’m not the type of person that likes uncertainties and I am also not the type of person who lets a problem be unsolved. I am what you would call a “fixer.” So anyway in one way or another I asked him if he liked me and he said he didn’t know. Well that was kind of annoying but whatever. He asked me too and I also said I didn’t know. Then he asked if he could kiss me and I said yes. I’m kind of ashamed to admit this but I felt like a loser being 21 and never being kissed. I know that I shouldn’t feel bad about it, but the issue still stands. So I really wanted to kiss somones-- or should I say anyone. The kiss was not good. It didn’t feel good. He stuck his pointed tongue on my teeth. It was really not good. After the kiss, I wanted him to leave. I wanted to think by myself about how I felt, but he wanted to talk more. And he basically held me hostage in my own home for a couple hours. It was horrible. Everything he said made me cringe. After he finally left I called my brother and he told me it seemed like I just didn’t like Boy.

For the next week I was seemingly okay, but whenever I thought about the kiss I would violently rub my mouth and have that intense “gross” feeling. I didn't want to think about it anymore, but I thought about it all the time. By the end of the week I was having a full-blown breakdown. I never wanted to see/talk/think about Boy again and I still don’t. He texted me and everything he said was super annoying. I didn’t want to explain to him what was happening so I just told him I was busy and I was going through something. He said texted me annoying stuff like “oh ok...” and “I must have really messed up.” I really don’t like pity parties so it just made my dislike towards him increased. This is really unfortunate because we really were good friends.

It's been about 2 months now and I am still super uncomfortable. When I think about it I get violently upset and I want to aggressively rip the memories out of my brain. I can’t even say these things out loud because it makes me so uncomfortable. Just trying to say “we cuddled” made me so distraught I started to feel painfully uncomfortable and I start to cry in an angry and distressed way. I am so confused and I feel so helpless. My head is constantly swirling with questions like: Are my obsessive compulsive tendencies coming back? I have to wash myself a lot throughout the day, is this related? This is too uncomfortable to just be a dislike of kissing right? Is it just because I don’t like Boy specifically? Is it because I’m not super comfortable with my body (I am overweight and I used to be really insecure but I’m pretty confident these days)? Will I ever be able to have sex? Is it related to my mental health disorders? Or am I possibly some type of asexual, like a gray asexual? Am I alone in all this? Or maybe is this some new mental illness that I need to add to the list of things wrong with my brain? What even is normal? And when will I feel better?

*tl;dr: I have a history of mental illness (Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies, Panic Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder). As a child I was disgusted by sex, but when I turned seventeen I became interested. I went from really hating myself to really liking myself in the past year.*

*tl;dr: I somehow got involved with a friend of mine that is a boy. We kissed and know I have been plagued by this violently “gross” feeling for the past 2 months and continue to feel that way. I hate him because of it and I feel super helpless. I am worried about never being able to have sex and always feeling so violently repulsed.*

I am so lost. Anything you have to say could help so please feel free. You can ask me any questions-- I am totally open book.

835,mentalhealth,1,"I think I may be mentally disturbed? I experienced traumatic experiences as a child and I'm afraid I may be mentally disturbed.

I have a few life experiences I'd like to share.

One of my younger memories of my mother was when I (6 at the time) and my brother (3 at the time) watched as my mother was screaming at my father on the phone as she tried to pull off the locks on our ammunition cabinet. I'm not sure if she was trying to shoot herself or my father. I made my brother go up to her and tell her she was being crazy. She just turned to him and yelled ""Oh yeah? Well you have a crazy mama.""

I used to have big anxiety as a kid, and still a tiny bit now, of when my parents would drive me places and I wouldn't recognize the roads that they were taking me somewhere to kill me, abandon me or drive the car into water to kill us.

I used to be hypersexual as a young child (5-10) because of the stuff I saw on TV. I would often get in trouble at school because I was write or draw sexual things in books.

My father used to beat me and my brother with his belt when we misbehaved. I think he wanted to and liked hurting us. He would say he waited for use to act up so he could hit of on the ass 5, 10 times with his belt.

My father also attempted to murder me (11 or 12 at the time) at a house party we were having when somebody ate his plate of food he has hiding in the microwave. He said he was going to shoot every last motherfucker there until he found out who did it. His friends had to drag him away from the ammo cabinet and gun safe. I grabbed my younger cousin and hid I my mom's car with a pair of scissors while it happened.

In 2nd grade I tried to commit suicide. I've been morbidly obese my entire life and was dehumanized at school daily. I wrote a suicide note that my parents accidentally found. I tried so, so hard to hit my head as hard as possible on the cinderblock walls of my school with the intention of dying, not knowing that that wouldn't kill me. I used to jump off the top of my playground equipment too, and fall without catching myself, just like how it felt when I would collapse on the floor and hit my head. I did it over and over again. I was 9.

Jump to 7th-9th grade. I began cutting my wrists. I became addicted. I then later had sexual responses from it. I now have very scary and violent, dangerous fetishes and sexual intrests.

In 10th grade I tried to kill myself again.

I was incredibly depressed my Jr year, too. But no suicide attempt. I would cry myself to sleep, almost manic, nearly screaming because I was terrified that I was insane because of the thoughts on my brain.

That's all I will like to share, if you would like to know more, ask.

Now, present day I'm scared I may be mentally disturbed as I take pleasure in violent porn and have murderous fantasies that I take sexual pleasure in.

I feel like a creep when I think about people. I feel something wrong in me, like if my brain were a clock it would be ticking differently than other people. It's hard for me to feel love for other people or animals. I struggle with food addiction too but have stopped cutting for a long time. 

A week ago my doctor suggested to my mother that I see a therapist because I seemed depressed (just diagnosed with an autoimmune disease). When I was first diagnosed I thought about killing myself more than I already do. It was all I could think about.

836,mentalhealth,1,"Vent about something. No need to respond if you don't want too. So I'm going to assume these are just panic attacks but I feel like I should post about it because one just happened and I'm honestly still feeling it and I don't know what else would calm me down except for writing.

So earlier I was dropping my friends off at there house and I got out of the car to say goodbye. At this point I'm trying to keep myself level because I already know something was up with my feelings at that point. but then my friend put out his hand for a handshake and for some reason when I put my hand in his I literally squeezed it as hard as I could and dropped to the ground laughing, so much so it hurt. When I laugh like that it usually means I'm trying to cry or at least that's what it feels like, so when I heard my other friend chuckle it made it a whole lot worse knowing that they couldn't understand the pain I was actually in. After I thought I calmed myself down and they went in I punched the nearest tree a couple times and as soon as I got home I threw up. I'm still feeling gutted and kinda frightened because I can still feel that knot in my throat like I'm about to cry. This isn't the first time this has happened and I'm afraid it may happen again tonight. Every day I have that knot and I try not to think about it but obviously when your trying to talk to someone like that it doesn't go very well. Especially if they ask if I'm ok cause then that just gets me thinking about it. Anyway. hhh sorry I always feel bad posting about myself. ANYWAY.

840,mentalhealth,1,"A Little Help Please Hey, I'm a sixteen year old female student, I've never posted on Reddit before, but I'm seriously struggling right now. For the past 3 or 4 months I haven't been myself, I'm super aloof, blunt, easily irritated, sad, unmotivated, and uncomfortable around most people. I'm the type of person who never talks about their own problems and I just tend to listen to others, they wont ask about me but I've gotten used to having no one to talk to. Any type of physical affection from my friends, and even my parents, leaves me feeling stiff and uneasy. I can be openly affectionate with my four year old brother without limitations, but it feels weird with anyone else. Half a year ago I'd be itching to either receive or give affection, but even talking about it (especially romantic relationships) leaves me feeling sick to my stomach. My mother is the only person who has noticed that anything has been off. I wanted to talk to my best friend about it today after we got off the bus and told her that I had something personal I wanted to talk about, but once we were walking home she was just talking about her boyfriend, so I didnt say anything. I feel so empty and alone, positive that I have no one that I can go to. I want to be like I used to be but it feels like the whole world is on my shoulders weighing me down. I cried last night for the first time in months, felt like I was crying for hours, just tying to get everything out, and then I feel ashamed afterwards. During these months I don't look both ways when I cross the street, when walking to and from my bus I blast my music so I dont hear the cars passing. I don't WANT to die, it's just like I don't care, and I want to so bad. I feel like the only thing that's keeping me is my 3 younger brothers.

He told me that he’s been having panic attacks daily. He’s been suffering from depression since I’ve known him. As of right now, he took an entire week off work and has been drinking excessive amounts of alcohol every night. 

My other friend and his family have taken him to a doctor and got him on antidepressants, however he claims they aren’t helping, and dodges whenever we tell him to seek a higher dose. I’ve gotten a chance to see him while on break from college, but we mainly communicate over Xbox.

I don’t know what to do at this point to help. He’s not a very open person and trying to pry at him probably would be counter productive.

851,mentalhealth,1,"Am I turning into the cockroach? For a while now I've been back to the good ole taking forever in the shower and laying in bed as long as possible in order to feel any sort of warmth. Cherry on top is that tomorrow's my birthday; I'm turning 20, and I feel like being young is no longer an excuse-- that I need to get with it. Fuck the birthday, really.

I stopped looking at myself in the mirror because I don't even feel pretty anymore. I'm not sure I ever did, but I used to be obsessed. And I can't understand why being lonely bothers me so much if when I'm with others all I long for is going right back to being by myself. All of my relationships are very superficial because I won't allow them to be anything more(?) Also, my emotions sabotage me fairly often; sometimes they just don't make sense.

853,mentalhealth,1,"Help with Depersonalization. I think it started in October of 2019 or something. I can't even tell if I really am depersonalized or it's not a real thought. I'm 15 years old. February of last year, my parents had a pretty rough divorce. I think I have anxiety and maybe depression, I just don't want to label myself with such things. I know depersonalization is an anxiety-based disorder. It can also be triggered by trauma. I've heard people having this for years. I don't know if I can really last that long. I talked to my mom just a few nights ago and I am seeing a therapist this Wednesday. Even as I type this, I can't really tell if what I'm typing is a figment of my imagination or not.

I'm scared. I'm really scared and I don't know how much longer I can go like this. It's all I think about. Videos and articles I've seen say try not to worry or think about it, but that's literally what having anxiety is about. You can't stop worrying. I don't want this to ruin my life.

Depersonalization is one of the hardest things I've ever had to explain. I know what I see is real. I just don't feel like I'm there. I feel like a lose so many things, then when I look, I just can't focus. I feel like I'm searching for the item, but my eyes are closed. I barely talk to anyone, and I don't like my friends.

855,mentalhealth,1,"I don't know where to go from here I've dealt with depression for pretty much as long as I can remember, but I've been able to shrug it off most of the time and live life fairly normally. About a year ago I went vegan and starting losing weight, finally escaping my lifetime obesity. I thought all my problems existed due to me being fat, and that if I could be skinny I would be successful in everything I tried. Obviously that was disillusion, but I never ever imagined that my confidence and social skills would seemingly shed off with the pounds.

I've always definitely been a quirky person, obsessed with niche music and not much else. I've always had a natural talent for music but as a person with very low self-worth, other musicians with their own fragile egos have often seen me as a target, and I've developed trust issues an a feeling of nihilism towards my passion. When I talk to people I feel like the only thing I have to talk about is music, and I end up getting frustrated in most conversations about the topic, a recipe for social failure.

After a toxic first serious relationship and an even more toxic rebound, I decided to give up on relationships. I didn't want to be hurt anymore, but moreso I didn't want to sacrifice my own personality to better suit someone else's romantic desires. Most relationships I see appear to be full of conflict and I have no interest. I came out as asexual even though I still have the desire to have sex simply because I am repulsed by how open people are about it. Before my first serious relationship got too toxic we had an okay sex life, but I still found it to be quite overrated, and I felt like the fantasies I had developed from watching porn were not nearly as satisfying in real life. I recently went NoFap and quit porn, which has helped me feel more attracted to people, but I don't feel like I have the social skills or energy to flirt and pursue. I want to find someone who's life isn't purely about sex and relationships, and don't expect their partner to change drastically for them, but I feel more and more like this doesn't even exist. Even if it does, how would even I be able to pull myself together socially to get together with that person in the first place?

I am planning to spend my final year at university abroad in order to reinvigorate my social skills, and find enjoyment in sex/relationships again, but as the application deadline gets closer I feel more and more like I'm just running away and I don't really have any business going. Additionally, Japan is where I am trying to go. I am learning the language but its a very slow and frustrating process, but regardless, if I can't even talk to people in English how the fuck am I supposed to be able to talk to people in Japanese?

I guess I'm just lost. I have no motivation besides to finish my degree. I'm so lonely and I just want someone to put their hands through my hair and tell me it will be okay. I don't want to feel ugly anymore, I don't want to feel like a bad musician anymore. I don't want to feel like I have to run away but I also don't see what's left for me where I'm currently at. I don't want to feel like everyone is more savvy and clever than me in conversations. I don't want to feel like the least entitled person to happiness but everyone I've ever cared about has led me to believe that. I want to make new friends that I won't drift away from or won't say terrible things to me. 

I really don't know where to go from here and any insight is appreciated.

856,mentalhealth,1,"(This probably isn't going to make a whole lot of sense) Weird stuff going through my head I really don't like writing this. It makes me feel so uncomfortable. I don't know if I'm doing this to myself or what, but I feel so anxious and weird now. 

But I think I have to... I don't know. Do I have to be typing this now??  I don't know. I don't know that I want to talk about this. I want to feel comfortable. I don't want to talk about things that may or may not be bothering me like why I'm so weird all the time in my head when I should just be normal.

Its confusing me. And I'm sorry! I'm not trying to type so much I KNOW its unreasonable to be typing  all this, but I don't know what to do. I'm so anxious so often and I always wanna just type and type and type and no one likes what I type and I feel like I'm having both impulses and compulsions.Its not stuff like I can jump off a cliff if I just randomly acted on that urge, so maybe its not OCD but now I'm thinking about my head so much...

There's something in my head that's not quite working right but I don't know what the fuck it is.

I don't think about tossing myself off a cliff for no reason or acting on senseless impulses, but I  always worry about typos and how much I'm typing and making things even. I I didn't think much of it most of my life, I have other things to think about and social anxiety and ADHD to boot.

But its so fucking weird and strange. Its not even consistent! Sometimes, I can cook a chicken and pick it off the floor to eat it, other days, I throw out perfectly cooked (or even just undercooked because realistically I just need to fucking cook it more) chicken for no good reason or I obsess over what has or hasn't touched my food.

But there's no ritual, there's no ""so I don't die"" clause to most of it. Sometimes this weird anxiety OCD thing isn't even some cut and dry thing that makes sense at all sometimes I'm just fucking screaming in my head and I have no idea why and I just keep repeating over and over in different ways that I have no idea why. I can't address it all, because thinking about it makes it WORSE.

857,mentalhealth,1,"I don't understand how to express my anger, and it's giving me repression issues I have felt from a young age, that I have been discouraged from showing anger. Every time I did I would get smacked down (metaphorically) for doing so.

If I got into an argument the other person would just out-yell me.

859,mentalhealth,1,"Does anyone else feel like movies about mental health struggles make you feel worse? For some reason movies and shows detailing struggles with mental health issues are always attractive to me. Like I can’t keep away because they are interesting. But at the same time I find myself wallowing in my own issues as I watch them. Like I am watching Spinning Out and while I can acknowledge the extremes the character experiences with BPD, I feel like my own emotions become more extreme just by watching it. Likewise, I watched Undone and felt myself getting just as stuck in the confusion and felt like I myself was losing touch with reality. 

I’m not sure if it’s just good cinematography or if this is something other people who have mental health issues experience. None of my family or my partner really understand that level of emotion or relation that comes with watching these films and when I try to explain it they just say I’m too emotional. And that feeds the feeling of isolation that comes with a mental health condition.

860,mentalhealth,1,"Getting better, where to begin? To make a long story short, I'm 18. I graduated a little over half a year ago and I'm terrified going forward. 

I was severely bullied throughout my elementary and high school years, I lost the few ""friends"" I had when one of their boyfriends got handsy with me at a New Year's Party, and I have a strained relationship with my family, especially my parents, due to years of taking abuse at school and not knowing another outlet took it out at home. 

I moved to a different program part way through my grad year and I was able to catch up and graduate on time. It was a big help to me being in the program, but there's an overall feeling I can't rid of. 

I can't figure out how to let go of everything that happened and move forward. I'm always angry and sad and it comes out as a lack of effort and disinterest in partaking in my everyday life. I can't connect with people because I'm immediately standoffish at best and hostile at worst with new people, I don't like them. The problem is I don't really have anything to be upset about.... And I can't pinpoint why I'm feeling this way. 

At the moment, I'm on good terms with my parents if a little tense, I'm not in school anymore, I'm working and I enjoy my job, I'm travelling. There's nothing in my life that I can see that would justify me feeling this way. To be honest, I thought I'd be dead by now, I didn't think I was going to make it this far in life. And now I'm here, practically an adult, and I'm going to be on my own because I'm not a kid anymore.

861,mentalhealth,1,"Is this normal? I have trouble reading mathematical proofs in papers. Noticed recently (started grad school). I am fine with formulas sprinkled in the main body of computer science and related papers (and rest of the text in the paper), however, I struggle with the appendix parts where there are often multi-page proofs. It feels like my brain doesn't like reading it - if I continue to try to go through it after a few lines or multiple equations and variables are introduced I need to force myself to continue. It is better if I have smth to write on (a piece of paper or a touchscreen) to follow derivations myself, but that takes significantly more time (quick note: my writing is fine. I can generate proofs for comparable problems).

Other than that, my academic achievements are probably above average, graduated 3.91/4 GPA from one of the top schools, 94 percentile GRE scores (Graduate Record Examinations, both math and verbal). My strongest aspect is problem-solving and by extension programming, and performance somewhat linearly decreases as the task distances from those concepts. My reading comprehension is pretty good unless the text falls into the above-mentioned type.

So, my struggle with reading might be caused by the lack of practice - I didn't need to read many proofs in cs and engineering classes during undergrad since I understood most things intuitively, and frankly, they were far simpler (and shorter). Worked at Big N after undergrad, but didn't get much experience in this regard there either.

862,mentalhealth,1,"How can I help my boyfriend understand my mental health issues? I posted some of this on another sub for something else but is basically an example of what I mean; 

 My boyfriends license was suspended so he cant drive to work. I work on campus which is where he works. He asked me if I would be able to pick him up and drop him off because he lives on the way, but it is about 15 -25 mins extra.

It wouldnt be a big deal and I would do it BUT....I have severe anxiety and last year I got in 2 accidents (not at fault) and since ive been scared to drive and developed a tick where I squint my eyes tight/long and tense/strain my neck/shoulder muscles, so I am also constantly in pain from tensing it when it gets bad. and triggered by stress/driving which is unsafe and dont drive when its bad, however most of the time I am okay but just stressed and have painful tension, but is not affecting my driving, but i only drive what i need to...extra time is just more time being in pain and stressed. 

I go to class/work on campus which is 45 minutes away. I only drive when I have to. I see doctors and say its caused by stress and have tried things to help, they say I can drive unless I feel it is very bad and going to affect my driving (which sometimes it will so I choose not to drive that day/call out of work) so i do not put others on the road in danger. He understood but yesterday he called asking me to drive him and i told him i cant and he says ""It's only 5 mins out of your way not a big deal"" I told him imagine only being able to hold your breath for 3 mins and then say you needa do it 5 mins longer, you CANT. This is how I feel to drive. It goes away when I dont drive for abit.

He tells me that he told people and he said that they said what im doing is fucked up, when of course, he didn't tell them my situation other than just ""not feeling like it"". With that being said, he did this to himself and refuses to take responsibility! he got his license revoked, multiple tickets/accidents/car stolen, why should i pay for his mistakes?

So he ends up ubering to me so I could drop him off at campus next day and said I didnt need to go to his work, just park. I agree even though he wanted me to pick him up to begin with to avoid taking uber twice which he did anyways. We leave and he starts asking why I am mad and I said im upset how he acted towards me. We get there and he starts going off on me how im selfish, told me he would never do anything for me, drive me anywhere again (which he did only few times forever ago) and says how 5 mins isnt a big deal. I start crying because I feel I am constantly told it's not a big deal when im in physical pain and anxious constantly. I told him he doesnt understand which is okay, but he says he does. We park and he says ""great now I have to walk for 2 hours to get to work"" WHEN HE TOLD ME i just needed to park and he will get to his work and made me feel like shit, so I drive him to his work which was 7ish minutes away but took me 15 to get back (I hit all the lights and there was traffic on that side) and was 1 min away from being late to work. He didnt thank me just said that hed never do anything for me again and that i made this difficult for no reason, im selfish and its my fault bc I wont ""fix it"" (my twitch/anxiety). I do feel bad, at the same time I cant change it.   


I am constantly working with doctors and doing what they advice, trying new medications/new methods to combat this and help myself but it takes time and have monthly if not more appointments to try a new medication or something else and to talk about things whatever it may be. But he keeps telling me that I'm not trying because its not ""fixed"" and keeps thinking my issues are not a big deal and that im just being dramatic. And I honestly feel awful because I constantly feel I'm not being believed....that my issues are just made up and exaggerated, that it doesnt affect me ""that much"" But then in other times he will say how understanding and supportive he is of me and always seems geniuine in times  I need it, but as soon as my issues are affecting him all hell breaks lose and he tells me he still understands, but it suddenly is not a big issue and im exaggerating. It's starting to make me feel I am exaggerating and that it isn't a big deal and that its just all in my head and i dont know how to feel anymore because i cant control any of this at all so how can i be exaggerating? i dont know anymore but i just feel so helpless and that everything is  just in my head and im just an awful person/gf and just blame myself.

This type of thing happened to me twice while under the influence of weed. But today was different i walked with my friends to class but they would always talk to eachother but they didn't and they didn't look real to me but i knew they were because i was sober but they looked like what a character in a 3d film looks like.

872,mentalhealth,1,"Treatment for Self-Injury through Research Study Thank you to the moderators of /r/MentalHealth for allowing me to post here!

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non- invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires, two neuroimaging sessions, and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS.
Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

If you are interested, please contact Young at 646-774-7603, or at young.cho@nyspi.columbia.edu. More information is also available at https://tdcsresearch.wordpress.com/. It is better to reach out to us directly through these channels rather than sending me a message here.

I was wondering if anyone else has noticed this for themselves? And if so what they did to counteract it. I really don't want to go off the medicine, but constantly being extremely sick has brought back my depression anyways.

TLDR: started taking antidepressants and now I get sick all of the time",antidepressant compromising immune hi m new sub relatively new antidepressant bare started taking flouroxitine september greatly reduced depression anxiety past month gotten sick time past year friend recently told new medicine little information online kind support wondering noticed did counteract really don t want medicine constantly extremely sick brought depression anyways tldr started taking antidepressant sick time
878,mentalhealth,1,"I don't know what to do. Alrighty lemme get started, some things to clear up for background info, this is my first reddit post so im really new here! I just feel like i needed advice from somebody else because i have nobody to talk to except 1 person(ill get into it later), to start things off im 17 years old and i love to be outgoing for people no matter what cause i love helping other whenever/however i can and i love to make people laugh even tho it can get me in touble, im more of the class clown. When i was born my mom noticed i didnt behave normally (shes an occupational therapist) so i was taken to the doctors and diagnosed with high-functioning autism at a very young age (also im sorry if i skip around a lot i have a tendency to do that lol) my mother has always been so outgoing for me and has been there for me. And ive always been the person to overthink a lot and i  get extreme anxiety often, so ive had a very antisocial life up until highschool when i started to break my chains finally, but up until now. Recently i feel like everything has been going downhill, first im super worried about what im going to do about life after i graduate, and when i got a job in the past summer it was very stressful because the coworkers would think im weird and think im rude by not following instructions even though its only cause i had a hard time processing things (to an average person it seems like nothing is wrong with me) and i feel like ill never be able to secure a good job and keep it without getting fired. And when school started i quit when things started getting really busy. So when my seinor year i was so happy to be just relaxed but now the past month has been nothing but doubt, mostly because when i see everything i do i always think its not good enough and i could do better but am never been able to achieve it. For example i LOVE to play music as a hobby and have been playing cello since i was 5 and have grown to play many instruments like piano, guitar, drums, ukulele, and i also sing. And at home i have a mini recording studio that i use to record myself playing and edit which i taught myself to do but as of recently whenever i record and start editing all i can do is point out the mistakes i make and can never get it to be perfect by myself even though ive watched countless youtube videos to teach myself all i can but still with that i am always finding mistakes i make and end up almost crying cause i want to be good and when i listen to my favorite bands i want to be like them but never can achieve it. I want to come out with my own little album for the fun of it but i feel like people will think it sounds bad cause it's not probably. I want to talk to my friends about it but they dont know how to talk about things like this. And i do have a therapist that i see every 2 weeks but i dont feel like he really knows whats going on inside my head, and same goes with my mom but she understands me a lot more yet she is super stressed out as of recently and i dont want to bother her, so all of this has been making me just be really quiet and more anti-social than usual and i feel like crying all the time and just dont wanna get out of bed and wanna be in the shadows all the time even tho all i want is a shoulder to cry on. Does anyone have advice? Im sorry if its a lot of rambling and i can specify if you need me too! I just want to talk to someone. Thank you for reading!",don t know alrighty lemme started thing clear background info post im really new just feel like needed advice somebody talk person ill later start thing im year old love outgoing people matter cause love helping love make people laugh tho touble im class clown born mom noticed didnt behave normally shes occupational therapist taken doctor diagnosed high functioning autism young age im sorry skip lot tendency lol mother outgoing ive person overthink lot extreme anxiety ive antisocial life highschool started break chain finally recently feel like going downhill im super worried im going life graduate got job past summer stressful coworkers think im weird think im rude following instruction cause hard time processing thing average person like wrong feel like ill able secure good job getting fired school started quit thing started getting really busy seinor year happy just relaxed past month doubt think good better able achieve example love play music hobby playing cello grown play instrument like piano guitar drum ukulele sing home mini recording studio use record playing edit taught recently record start editing point mistake make perfect ive watched countless youtube video teach finding mistake make end cry cause want good listen favorite band want like achieve want come little album fun feel like people think sound bad cause s probably want talk friend dont know talk thing like therapist week dont feel like really know whats going inside head go mom understands lot super stressed recently dont want bother making just really quiet anti social usual feel like cry time just dont wanna bed wanna shadow time tho want shoulder doe advice im sorry lot rambling specify need just want talk thank reading

881,mentalhealth,1,"Want to help my suicidal brother [22y] My younger brother (by 1 year), who I’ll call Joe, is suffering from depression. He aspires to be a highly successful executive in the business or finance sector, which he would be able to achieve with his high intellectual ability, his personality, and with an economics degree that he has been working towards....on and off. However, he has had to resit his first year multiple times and is currently on a break from university (in the UK we call it uni and that’s what I’ll be using from now on) after being told that he can’t resit a couple exams he failed till this summer, as opposed to last summer when he had expected to resit them. Before that happened he had mostly been doing really well, getting many 2:1s and firsts (the two best grades) in most of his exams and courseworks. But since the news about the whole year of delay he has been relapsing into his previous self-destructive behaviour, which isn’t even that bad but involves a heavy amount of League of Legends, which he is highly addicted to when in a negative mindset. He told me today that he now uses it as his way to socialise because he alienated many friends after a drunken night out; he said that if it weren’t for that he would go crazy. He also told me today that he has, a few times now, considered taking all of the painkillers in the house and consuming them all in one. Since he has a few times denounced suicide as an illogical and stupid thing that people can do (an opinion I disapprove of), this came as a shock.

We both still live with our parents because he’s an on/off student and I recently got my masters degree and am looking for jobs, but our parents are not supportive towards him so he only really has me. Neither of us have ever been able to rely on our parents to help us out with any social or mental issues we were having, and my mum in fact has a negative effect on his mindset and behaviour (and mine, when I was depressed, but I’m ok now). She means well. She is enthusiastic about bringing up two children who have the capacity and education (both privately educated and I have that masters) to go far in life, but she is not your typical nurturing mother. She doesn’t understand us, especially my brother. She came from a different culture - she moved to the UK from China when she was around my age (23-25); Chinese culture is not known for its emphasis on human psychology, instead being very focussed on academic success and the subsequent monetary rewards. Since living in the UK for 30+ years and working as a nurse, she has some understanding of mental health and how we deal with it in this country (and the Western world in general), but not enough to help my brother. Every time she sees him on that game; every time she catches him in bed past 11am; every time my brother neglects to make progress in uni or the degree apprenticeship applications that we’ve all recently agreed would be a realistic alternative to uni, she will get really pissed off and say something negative about his behaviour. He tells me that he is already feeling like shit for being like that, but her being all negative like that just makes him feel worse. And that’s so obvious to me, but my mum won’t fucking get it even though I’ve told her time after time to try and be positive towards him. I can’t blame this on my mother; Joe doesn’t want to either. But the fact is that we don’t live in a nurturing environment where we can effectively grow as people.

My own personal development came from uni, with influence from my uni friends. As a woman it’s different because I can be vulnerable in front of my friends and it’s not as much of a big deal (still really don’t like it though). But as a man who realises the negative effect of our culture of toxic masculinity has on him, yet still can’t shake his traditional masculine ideals, he can’t stand to be in a dark situation in front his friends. So he has avoided social situations altogether, with only us family members and his work colleagues (he has a part-time job as a housekeeper) as people to talk to in person. I told him that his mentality of not getting help contributes to suicide rates, of which there is a higher trend amongst men across the globe. He agrees. But he can’t help it. It’s hard to think positive when your mind is that deep in a black hole.

Today I insisted that he get therapy, which I’ve mentioned in the past but not with as much emphasis as today. He doesn’t enjoy the idea of therapy because he saw some sort of counsellor at uni for some time and he says it didn’t help at all. But I told him that he could see a psychotherapist or clinical psychologist with years of experience, a PhD and specialist knowledge in his sort of situation/issue. He says he will see one next week. But to me, a week is a long time. We have a family history of depression too; my granddad committed suicide when my dad was 12; my dad himself has suffered depressive episodes (which improved with therapy!) and my uncle is highly unstable. I believe we are genetically predisposed towards suicidal thoughts. I had suicidal thoughts when I was a teen. I hate to hear that my brother has the same currently.

Do I have to do a TL;DR for a fucking mental health subreddit? Surely not but I will anyway cos I cba to check.

TL;DR my 22yo younger brother is depressed and this has led to gaming addiction, staying in bed till 1-3pm, multiple retakes of first year of university study, current hiatus from uni, current despair at his situation and subsequent suicidal thoughts.

882,mentalhealth,1,"I am extremely indecisive and always disapprove of my own decisions. Not sure if this belings here, cause everybody else seemed to be writing about more severe problems, but i want to get it out. 
I am super bad at decision-making. And i hate it. 
Whenever there is a decision, i go full on desperate, i cry for about a day or 2, until i have made a decision. I constantly go back and forth between prefering the one decision and then the other ine again, back and forth like 20 times. 

([Recent example] The example that made me write this: I applied for a job (im in my first semester in college) and got a reply that i didnt get it, and was kinda relieved cause i dint really have much time anyway. then i got the message that the previous person turned it down and i could have it. When off the phone, i started crying, i started thinking and thinking, i texted my mom, asked for opinions. The entire day, i thought of it, went back and forth between „No, i have too much stress, i should not put extra stress on, especially as i dont need the money“ and then „but it is good for character development, it is a very small job, i should say yes to some things“. 
Went back and forth, could not decide and was completely desperate. I decided not to take it, turned the job down and ever since i am thinking that i should have taken it, that it would have been fun. ) 

Soo, when i thought i could not have it, i felt fine and relieved, because i dont have so much time anyway. But now, a few days later i find the exact same outcome bad and feel like i absolutely should have done the job, just because this time i made the decision!! Why am i ok with an outcome, but not anymore if it was my responsibility??? 
I hate this about me, but i cant stop feeling that way. It feels awful. No matter the decision, i doubt it and think it is the wrong one. So i feel bad while having to decide and i feel bad after having decided...",extremely indecisive disapprove decision sure belings cause everybody writing severe problem want super bad decision making hate decision desperate day decision constantly forth prefering decision ine forth like time recent example example write applied job im semester college got reply didnt kinda relieved cause dint really time got message previous person turned phone started cry started thinking thinking texted mom asked opinion entire day thought went forth stress extra stress especially dont need money good character development small job say yes thing went forth decide completely desperate decided turned job thinking taken fun soo thought felt fine relieved dont time day later exact outcome bad feel like absolutely job just time decision ok outcome anymore responsibility hate stop feeling way feel awful matter decision doubt think wrong feel bad having decide feel bad having decided

885,mentalhealth,1,"Feeling like I am going nowhere, left behind I've lived my life with the hope that something would eventually change, and I would finally be satisfied. However, I am now 23 and it feels like I'm not progressing towards anything that may make me happy. I usually have periods where I feel like trying something new and get out of my comfort zone, and periods like this one when I look back and feel like it was all for nothing.

I think that one of my main weaknesses has always been the absence of experience in some key aspects of life, especially relationships. I never had a girlfriend. I am not bad-looking, but very insecure when dealing with girls in a romantic way (mainly because of the aforementioned lack of experience). I would even go as far to say that my behavior may sometimes be considered asexual - even though I am not. Furthermore, the situation I am in right now (and who knows, perhaps also in the future) does not allow me to meet new people that easily, especially girls (I study computer engineering so yeah... lol).

I feel like this lack of experience also influences other aspects of my life. I don't feel on par with most of the people my age. I feel a not-so-much adult in an adult world, alienated, left behind. This vicious cycle will eventually get worse and worse, as people go on with their life while things will get harder and harder for me to turn around.

That said, I tried to change things - perhaps not hard enough. I asked out a girl I barely knew via DM, she eventually said yes. This was my first date of my life. It went well, or at least it seemed to me, we laughed a lot and I personally had fun. But then she said she was not interested when I asked for a second date a few days later. Thing is, she is literally the only one I could have asked out that I somewhat know. This was one month ago.

And now I am in one of those periods in my life where I feel like this is not going anywhere. I hope it's not true, but it's been like this for all these years. The hypothesis that this may be my life until the end gets more and more realistic as time goes on.

I went to therapy for most of my life - from when I was a child up until 2 years ago, when I was 21. I never had the courage to state that never having been in a relationship was a problem for me. It was something I was ashamed to express my desire of. In general, I never managed to talk freely about my problems there because of this.

I quit therapy after realizing that, after all these years, I was not happy with my life. I agree that it sounds simplistic, but I also wanted to try and live without it and see how I would fare. I still am on my meds though (prescribed from a doctor).

I would love to hear some valuable, intelligent advice on one or more topics I've talked about in this post.

I would also like to chat with people if interested, as I tend to lose touch with people I know during these periods.",feeling like going left lived life hope eventually change finally satisfied feel like m progressing make happy usually period feel like trying new comfort zone period like look feel like think main weakness absence experience key aspect life especially relationship girlfriend bad looking insecure dealing girl romantic way mainly aforementioned lack experience far say behavior considered asexual furthermore situation right know future doe allow meet new people easily especially girl study computer engineering yeah lol feel like lack experience influence aspect life don t feel par people age feel adult adult world alienated left vicious cycle eventually worse worse people life thing harder harder turn said tried change thing hard asked girl barely knew dm eventually said yes date life went laughed lot personally fun said interested asked second date day later thing literally asked somewhat know month ago period life feel like going hope s true s like year hypothesis life end get realistic time go went therapy life child year ago courage state having relationship problem ashamed express desire general managed talk freely problem quit therapy realizing year happy life agree sound simplistic wanted try live fare med prescribed doctor love hear valuable intelligent advice topic talked post like chat people interested tend lose touch people know period

But since my brother and my sister moved out and don’t keep much contact with her, I have to live with her. She is a very immature person. She is constantly lying about where she is going and so on. I never know whether I should say something or not, because she will either not respond or respond with  smth like ‘Yeah I do what I want’ or with actually something understanding ir with something like that makes me wish I have never said anything, because it made her sad. On one side she  looks out for me and on the other side she makes fun of me in front of other or tells them my secrets or makes fun of my anxiety or OCD. But  when I complain about it she apologises and says that she’s sorry for being a bad mum (and so again and again). I feel bad, because I feel like I am sorta not appreciating her. She can be very careless and also very compassionate. I feel kind of torn apart. She never provided any safety and ignored that my stepfather abused me. Only when I confronted her she suddenly did something even though she saw me getting hurt.

896,mentalhealth,1,"am i a bad person? so recently i've realized that i'm not a great person. i think i'm a compulsive liar, and i always lie to get myself out of trouble or out of bad situations. but i've also found that i tend to blame everything that goes wrong in my life on others, and i react extremely badly to criticism or accusatory remarks, oftentimes with me faking feeling bad and other things to make other people see me in a better light. i've just come to realize this, and hate myself for this. but it's not just that, i think there's a pattern: i really hate being put in vulnerable situations, like when i have to say sorry to someone or confront someone i hurt or something like that because i really don't want to feel like a bad person or be put in the uncomfortably vulnerable position. has anyone experienced this, does anybody know what this is, and do you have any tips? i really really want to get better or become a better person and i really hate hurting people without realizing that i'm doing it.

edit: i also oftentimes stay tucked deep within my comfort zone, and i never really want to go out, for example if i don't feel like doing something or it might make me in the slightest bit uncomfortable, i just won't do it at all. this has also lead to some more heated arguments because i really dislike saying sorry (i mean i do want to say sorry but i really don't like the process of doing it). :(",bad person recently realized m great person think m compulsive liar lie trouble bad situation tend blame go wrong life react extremely badly criticism accusatory remark oftentimes faking feeling bad thing make people better light just come realize hate s just think s pattern really hate vulnerable situation like say sorry confront hurt like really don t want feel like bad person uncomfortably vulnerable position experienced doe anybody know tip really really want better better person really hate hurting people realizing m doing edit oftentimes stay tucked deep comfort zone really want example don t feel like doing make slightest bit uncomfortable just won t lead heated argument really dislike saying sorry mean want say sorry really don t like process doing

903,mentalhealth,1,"My story and thoughts pt.1 I was trying to get some sleep for 3 hours, but instead i found myself thinking what i would write to my suicide note . I haven't tried seeking help at all or talking about my problems that much, but now i realized, that it's the only thing left to do.

I turned 21 recently and i feel like my life has nothing left to offer.

My world is getting darker everysingle day for unknown reason.

I dont live my life for my own sake, but for my closest friends which i consider my family. I made a promise to one of my friends, that i wouldn't consider suicide as an option a while back, but if nothing changes soon there is no doubt that i would break it eventually.

I think i've been depressed since 2014, but the past year it has made my life a living hell.

I can't get out of bed, answer phone, brush my teeth or get a shower and if i manage to do one of those things, i can say it was a good one.

In 2015 i got diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis. I was unable to move out of bed for several months, and even moving my hand made my whole body crumble from pain

( I dont remember much from this year or from the hospitalization when the ankylosing spondylitis hit me )

I didn't think alot of it back then but it must have had an insane impact on my mental health without me even realizing it.

I found happiness again somehow for a solid 8 months back in 2018 when i started lifting and going to gym almost everyday. I finally had found something to do with my life that i actually enjoyed alot. I was happy that i was making alot of progress and at the end of december 2018 i injured my shoulder, and to this day im unable to go back to gym and get back into lifting because my shoulder hurts so bad that i can't lift even a coffee cup without getting pain flowing into my arm.

After my shoulder injury, i was in a dark place. I was still finishing studies and taking a final mandatory classes to get out of the miserable school i was in. For somereason i asked if i could swap seats to sit next to a girl who was sitting alone by the time. She was really good at this subject, and would teach me, since i was terrible at it. I ended up asking her out and the next thing i know, we are hanging out everyday. Me being me , i got my feelings involved more than i should after like 1 to 2 months of doing things together, but not "" dating "" , we were just randomly having sex and chilling at our places binge watching shows.

But for me, all the good things come to an end quickly for some odd reason.

This was my 2nd time where i found something good in my life to lose it after being in really REALLY dark place.

I realized that nothing good ever lasts longer than a while for me.

I dont know how many times i can fall down and get up.

Im getting more and more tired.

I recently started "" losing time "" where i might say something and forget what i said after 1 minute and say it again.

Everyday is the same and many days are all blending into one day

I can't sleep or i sleep too much.

I haven't been able to cry in years and i miss it more than anything in this world, I WISH I COULD CRY!!!

In the beginning of 2018 i lost the ability to feel any emotions ( other than anger and irritation ) at all for many months, and i thought wow , this is good since im not sad anymore, but the days went by and i realized feeling nothing was worse than being sad. I was lost, but later this year i found my emotions again, to find them only being 10 times stronger.

feeling sadness 10x the normal amount isn't really maintainable, but when it gets to that point, my emotions just randomly shut off.

I also feel like with depression and anxiety im losing my intelligence day by day.

It gets harder to think and speak. My thoughts are slow and i can't focus at anything, also remembering even the most basic stuff is getting challenging.

When meeting new people, you get asked THE QUESTION "" What are your future plans? ""

You need to lie everytime to everysingle new person you talk to. In what world would you just say, that you see yourself dead in 2 years ? No, you will just make something up and tell them what they want to hear. Its getting really troublesome and boring.

I started cutting myself to feel better few months ago, it has been the only thing beside music to keep me going for now.

Im going to try and be brave and get help before it's too late for the sake of people i care about , for the first time in my life.

She didnt try to talk back anymore. She just cried for about 10 minutes. Our teacher called her mom, but during the time that we were waiting for her mom to arrive, she just continued crying loudly.

No one tried to comfort her. The teacher left to talk to her mother on the telephone on the floor below us. My other classmates CONTINUED doing the meeting and kept talking about how they will push with THEIR ideas for the project, which only made it worse.

After that, she started screaming while she was crying(Every classroom has soundproof walls and even the other classrooms heard her). And even while she is screaming, my classmates still continued their discussion.

907,mentalhealth,1,"I can't find out; Am I depressed or just sad very frequently? I am 17 and I've noticed a trend in my emotional states. It's not like I'm not happy at any given moment, but even when I am happy, deep inside, I feel dull. Even as I'm writing this, I just feel this horrible feeling inside of me that makes me want to stop and just stuff my head into a pillow and cry. And to make things worse ... I really don't know why I feel like this.

I have some friends. Most of them are not really what you would call close, but I can say that I have atleast one friend who listens to my problems. He's a good guy but he's a jock and the only thing he suggests for me is to play sports, but I've tried and it doesn't help. Punching walls when I'm angry doesn't do much better, but the pain serves as a distraction.

For some more context: I'm easily irritated. That's an understatement.
**Anything can tick me off when I'm in my sad phase**

I've not always been like this. My affinity to irritation has often led to me making some sharp remarks when I'm talking with said friends. But I feel so helpless. They think I can be very rude at times and on one occasion, I made one of my friends cry. I swear I wanted to sit right next to them and cry with them. *But I cannot.*

Jeez, I'm only 17 and I live a happy life compared to so many other people in the world. I think it's ironic for me to be this sad. 

My parents have always been prone to getting in fights with each other for the smallest things. My dad has anger issues and has broken many a pieces of furniture in his rage. I'm not comfortable talking to him till this day. 
My mother is better; I can talk to her a little more freely. She has been taking medication for depression for over 5 year now and has anger issues similar to my dad's. She'll throw her smartphone in anger and she'll stop talking to me if I ever take my dad's side in an argument. Basically, she believes she has the moral high ground in everything.
Needless to say, their marriage is not going great, but they are both hesitant to divorce. That does not mean they don't blackmail each other using divorce, which really hurts my mental well-being.

I also have a younger brother, who is 10 years old. Despite the seven year age gap, I CANNOT STAND HIM. He's a disrespectful brat who has learnt to manipulate my parents to buy him whatever he wants and he has no respect for my personal items. He won't listen to a SINGLE thing I ever ask of him and always acts entitled. But enough about him. I can't change him. I don't have the willpower.

On another note, I can sleep for hours on end and can stay away well past bedtime. Not something I'm proud of but I thought you should know.

My face is always dull and I frequently get remarks at school asking why I am always sad looking. It's just so much harder for me to show any emotions. One last thing is that, I find it difficult to cry. I think it's because I'm conditioned to suppress any sadness at home.

I rarely have any alone time and I don't have a room of my own. I share a room with my brother. My bed is a bunk bed and I have the upper bunk. That, perhaps, is the only place during the day when I can feel alone and by my thoughts. Otherwise I'm always in the eyes of people. I am typing this laying in my bed. 

If you need any more details, please comment. I just want to know if I am just your everyday sad teen or do I have depression. I am not karmawhoring. Please help me out, I will be really grateful.

She's been on probation before so I'm afraid that she will be expelled soon or just drop out. I know that she wants to graduate...she's just not going to class which means that she's failing her classes. 

She also has a history of depression &amp; suicidal tendencies. She used to go to a therapist when she was younger but was pulled out because our parents did not want to medicate her and she seemed to do a bit better but for the last few years she's been spiraling back down.

At this point, it's also impacting me because instead of focusing on my classes I'm just worrying about her and stressing out because she's missing lecture. It got to a point earlier this week where I was on the brink of an anxiety attack myself in the middle of the library because I was just so worried about her.

But as my family wanted me to be healthy, they forced me to eat anyways, and did their job well, as while I was getting older they taught me to force myself to eat, else I could have health troubles. I always took it very serious and so dictated myself to eat regularly and go fot healthy stuff, even tho It was more of a “task” than anything. Now that I’m 19, and realized how weird it is, compared to other people, this started to annoy me. This condition doesn’t bring any phisical illness at all, I don’t feel constantly tired or anything, never lose weight, and my depression symptoms are smaller nowadays, in other words, I feel completly fine. Even so, I decided to seek doctors about it (explained that it didn’t “start”, I have ALWAYS been like this), and not for my surprise, they recommended all sorts of medicines, and none of them worked at all. I keep having breakfast, lunch and dinner by forcing myself (I’m used to it) but never feeling that “need” for it, wich people call hunger, so IF I wanted, I could stay days without eating and feeling no difference (I actually did it years ago, for 3 days, and felt nothing).
I also searched the entire internet (overstatement) about it and found no case like mine, and no explanations to the cause or if there’s anything that could be done about it, and thus the reason I’m posting this here, maybe someone can relate.
Anyways, all I can think is this is some sort of brain issue, on whatever part should control hunger, but maybe I’m just wrong, not sure if I’ll ever know.",felt hunger healthy normal weight forever forcing eat pleasure eating m sure condition s wanted talk memory childhood nowadays record asking family food instead used hate meal time boring pleasure eating good food feel taste normally family wanted healthy forced eat anyways did job getting older taught force eat trouble took dictated eat regularly fot healthy stuff tho task m realized weird compared people started annoy condition doesn t bring phisical illness don t feel constantly tired lose weight depression symptom smaller nowadays word feel completly fine decided seek doctor explained didn t start like surprise recommended sort medicine worked having breakfast lunch dinner forcing m used feeling need wich people hunger wanted stay day eating feeling difference actually did year ago day felt searched entire internet overstatement case like explanation cause s reason m posting maybe relate anyways think sort brain issue control hunger maybe m just wrong sure ll know
916,mentalhealth,1,"Did I wake up from a 2-year dissociative episode? Hi everyone. Not sure if this is the right forum to post this, so feel free to redirect me to the right one.  I grew up very privileged,  in a nice house, and lived comfortably. My mom is a single mom and has an executive-level well paying job. She ran 5 miles every day and always was put together.  Due to her job, she worked lots of hours and I didn't see her that much growing up. (she is an amazing mom and I understand the sacrifices she had to make to raise us). My life was normal, I had never faced a single hardship. However, in my second semester of junior year in HS my mom lost her job. She became extremely depressed for two months and started sleeping all day every day. This was extremely out of character for her. She attempted to kill herself and I found her and took her to the hospital.  She spent a week in a mental hospital. Though she is an amazing person, she doesn't save money and doesn't ever ask for help. Unbeknownst to my sister and me, we were broke.  We moved out of our childhood home into a family friend townhouse, 4 of us and 3 pets. She eventually did get better and got a job about 7 months after.

I never went to therapy and just continued on with my life. I had extreme paranoia and general anxiety. I stopped caring about my appearance, stopped showering, started smoking a lot of weed, I knew I was depressed. I never felt like I was in my life, just coasting through. My senior year was spent with ups and downs.. I had high functioning depression. I spent that summer in my bed. I was always numb, and since I had nothing that excited me, I began to obsess over my body. I would spend hours every day taking pictures of my naked body comparing it to the day before. I had very very bad body dysmorphia and couldn't picture what I looked like if my life depended on it.  Fast forward to college, I went across the country to four-year in new England. I carried all the same issues with me but like I said I can function a normal life with depression.  I still went to class, made friends, joined a sorority,  partied (barely), and met boys. but, I was always numb and couldn't be myself. I got a nicotine addiction because that 5 seconds of head rush gave me something to feel. I play with my sleep ((stay up all night with caffeine (for the buzz) and sleep until 1 pm.

Winter break (now ) one day I woke up cleaned my room and completely reorganized (real depressioners know how crazy this is ) and began to want to read self-help books.I feel alive and happy (not manic) It's like my depression just literally disappeared? I also picked up a new brand of cart and had a very good high with it.. wondering if that had something to do with it thast caused a shift in my brain? (not new to carts I've probably owned like 30 lmao) I also quit nicotine btw :) this break.. my theory is that I've been in a dissociative episode triggered from the trauma.

Now a single father with sole custody so free time isn't that available along with the stresses of raising kids alone.  Anyway I have felt quite lonely for the past 2 years not being able to find time or the courage to do so.

I actually feel sick,  I'm constantly worrying and thinking what if this ends and I go back to having no opposite sex attention.  What if I mess it up and she wants to stop talking.  Then I'll get a message and I'm fine again.  The other night she was stressed and said she wanted to be by herself for the night.  This entire night I was a mess and kept thinking I stuffed something up,  going over our texts. Then the morning came and she called me and it was all fine but  she apologised for not calling last night as she just want feeling well.  I writting this right now because I'm doing it again right now.  I can't help it and I want it to stop. But the fear of losing the connection with someone is eating me up.  I'm self aware enough that I'm pretty sure I dont let this show to her which is good. I don't really know what I'm asking,  just how can I get rid of these feelings that aren't even true,  and how do I stop fearing the end when it's not even happening.

930,mentalhealth,1,"The education system is setting children up for failure. Opinions wanted! I’m a 3rd year university student studying psychology and for the past year I haven’t been able to get off my mind the idea that the education system is in dire need of tweaking when it comes to teaching students about mental health. IMO There’s way too much time and research going into treatment studies and into identifying risk factors for mental illnesses instead of PREVENTION strategies. I’m 20 now, and I realized that for the past 8 years, I’ve been using a variety of different coping mechanisms and distractions to deal with the increasing occurrence of unpleasant emotional states I would experience. Children turning into teenagers naturally start to experience changes in their mood states, thought processes, etc, which is normal! What isn’t normal when you think about it is that the education system teaches students next to nothing about how to manage and interact with your feelings, thoughts, and emotions. It’s like throwing a baby into a pool. And 1/3 of these kids parents will have their own, completely inadequate and lacking script of how to function that they’ll pass onto their children. 

When I was 12 I became anorexic. When I was 16, I moved on and discovered bulimia. My eating disorders tormented me throughout my whole high school experience and only ended in my first year university. The thing is it wasn’t so much about my body image. I’m still not sure what stress or emotions triggered it in me. The EDs do seem to be in my past for good as I haven’t relapsed in 2 years (nothings ever permanent, but I’ve moved from vice to vice and doubt I would go back to those) When I was 12 I had nothing in my repertoire - no tools in my toolbox - and I guess I thought I found something (starving myself), that made me feel good. And because it made me feel good, I hid my disordered eating from my family and friends the whole time, because if they knew, they’d try and take my disorder away from me - And my daily thoughts and feelings completely revolved around my obsession with food and the control that I had over it and my body. At the time, I thought that if they took my disorder out of MY hands (by forcing me to get help), then everything was over for me. I probably felt that way because I didn’t know there are practices to help you manage intense feelings and emotions.

I’m not sure what job I’m going into yet after university, BUT I know that I need to contribute in some way to reforming school policies so that mental health and mind management techniques are prioritized, and become considered as important as the other subjects. Because aren’t they?? Depression and anxiety can be so debilitating that people sometimes turn to suicide. Pretty sure learning about ways to manage negative affect are more important than trying to decipher Shakespeare plays for weeks on end in English class. I’m not saying that teaching children how to navigate information, stimuli, and their consequent thought processes is the end all be all for mental health disorders. I recognize that there truly are chemical imbalances in the brain and I think medication is so important for stabilizing people and giving them a second to finally get some air from whatever they are dealing with. But why do we learn all of these techniques to reframe our thoughts SO LATE, when someones already fallen depressed and fantasized many a time about killing themselves? Only THEN it’s time for a therapist to come in and try to teach you how to rewire your brain. Instead of attempting to teach an adult who has been functioning with a certain maladaptive schema for their whole life how to build an newer, healthier one, why don’t we start that processes earlier, when children’s life story and development is just beginning and their minds are like an empty book waiting to be printed on. We could fully equip children with all of the tools and information they need to be an objective observer of their own mind. 

I’d love to know, anyone who works with a school board, or has younger children, what the curriculum is like now? I was in elementary school only 8 years ago but you never know, things may have changed and perhaps steps have been taken to implement this idea! 

P.S. I’m speaking specifically about Canada and the U.S. which is where I live, and I don’t know what it’s like in other countries.

931,mentalhealth,1,"I'm in a confused place So, I'm dealing with lots of stuff at the minute...as most of you all are and I just dont know how to feel or what to do.

I'm not going into details because it's a long list of things but it boils down to how I should act and feel when it comes to my wife.

She has spent the last 3 years caring after our kids, always putting herself first and making sure they are raised the best way possible, some thing I admire in her and love her for. However, recently she has wanted to find herself and that has meant that she is distancing herself from me, not the kids, and wanting to do things on her own.

Now I dont have a problem with it in theory but we have always done things together.. since we first met, and I mean everything, so I am finding it hard to not see this as a rejection or not being good enough for her. Coupled with that is the fact she has started making friends, one in particular who is another man with who she flirts with constantly..even progressing beyond that whilst at the same time not showing any interest in me.

I also have problems making and maintaining friendships, I am casual acquaintances with many people but not really friends yet she believes that they are friends which causes issues when I say this to her.

In the past I have been upset and told her what she does and more importantly how she goes about it upsets me  ut she dismisses these and tells me I'm a ""drama queen"" and just manipulating her to control her and put her down...which is not the case.

At new years I had a bit of a mental break and now I am just trying to live by the motto ""what will be will be"" and think she will do what ever she wants to do and if she wants to leave she will. My issue is that it destroys me to think I'm not good enough and that I can be everything she wants outside the bedroom  but that she doesn't want me, is uninterested and rejects me inside the bedroom.

To top it off I am overweight, feel incredibly unattractive and ugly, a waste of time and effort and generally not good enough in any aspect of my life. I have also suffered a serious of injuries that has resulted in me having surgery last week which means another 8 weeks of not being independent. I don't have an positive reinforcement about how I look or if I am doing a good job but the issues are always highlighted to me.

But two years ago (I think, might be less) I started to really suddenly have a weird feeling. I just call it the weird feeling. I could be having a kinda normal day in the life, sitting on my couch and wham! There’s that weird feeling. It hurts, I feel weird, there’s a different kind of pain in my chest. When I have an episode I most of the time know why it was triggered. But with this weird feeling I have no clue. It seems to just show up for a couple minutes randomly and then go away.
Until a couple years ago I was involved with drugs. And if I didn’t know any better, I would describe it as coming down of MDMA. You’re having a good time and suddenly there’s the pain again but way worse. That’s kinda what it feels like?


I just wanted to ask if any of you experience the same thing because I can’t determine where it came from or what it is. Is it anxiety? Depression? Seems like some neurotransmitters in my brain were suddenly stopped or released for a short amount of time?

I am so fucked, I lost hope for things getting better. I have failed in my efforts to think positively, build habits, change some thinking patterns. I feel like I have done so much of what is recommended and always failed.

I just can't build a happy life, I cant seem to be productive or do anything good most days. When I am off work my days are so empty and I don't feel like I have it in me to turn this around. 

It's so hard and I don't believe that my life will end up being good in the end anyway. Most days I would rather wallow in my misery than do something because it's just so fucking hard.

I guess I have the very common ""my problems are unique and unfixable"" syndrome. I have just reached a point of learned helplessness.

934,mentalhealth,1,"Hi hi hi! I really didn't know where or how to ask anyone about this, so I though reddit was the best option, and this subreddit was the best I could find to talk about how I feel. If you have a better suggestion of a subreddit to ask please tell me about it.

Lately I've been numb. I stay up all night and wake up until 5pm. There are days where I don't eat anything, because of me just feeling fat, and then days where I just can't control my cravings at all, and eat much more than necessary. I don't get that much out of bed, and when I do, I just play videogames. I'm not interested in anyone, or anything, in that matter. I don't feel well either. There are days where I'm excessively stressed about small things, and end up playing games and try to forget why I was so stressed. I also have some trouble doing stuff by myself. For example, I can't and won't order food when there's nothing at home, 'cause it just stresses me out, or clean my room, 'cause I find it overwhelming even if it's just a scarf on the floor. I also have a lot of trouble when I'm alone. I have this weird problem, where I feel the need to even out every single one of my movements. For example, let's say my right hand stroke my cat... well my brain suddenly has the intense urge of stroking it with the left one, and if I don't, I get really anxious. This only happens when I become aware of me. It's not as often as you think though. Finally I'm sad that I don't have anyone to talk to. My parents are separated, and I only talk to my dad abt unimportant stuff, and my mom is just a very complicated person, and scolds me when I talk abt stress, 'cause it's just ""unreasonable for you to be stressed, wait until you're an adult, then you'll see"".

935,mentalhealth,1,"Unable to get a job. I am currently 20 years old and am having a very hard time getting a job due to my lack of experience. 
The reason I haven’t had a job until the point is because since I was about 13 I have dealt with a lot of anxiety and depression. 
So during school I never looked at getting a job because I thought it would just cause unnecessary stress (my family are fortunately financially stable enough that they never needed me to get a job to pay rent or such). 
Although now, I was recently put on citalopram and can feel my social anxiety letting up quite a bit. I no longer feel as though people are staring at me in public, or constantly think about the dumb thing I might have said to a stranger I’m never going to see again.  
So I now feel as though I’m in a better place mentally and would manage to maintain a job. 
The problem is, I’ve been applying to jobs for over a year, cafes, supermarkets, just random stores in general, but not one place as asked me for an interview and I suspect it’s due to me not having any work experience. 
I even got my barista certificate, but am still having no luck with coffee shops. 
I will keep applying to jobs but constantly getting rejected is starting effective my mental health in a bad way and I’m not sure what else I can do to get a job and move forward with my life. I feel very stuck because of all of this. 
If anyone has been in the same position, I’d be very happy to know how you got through it.

939,mentalhealth,1,"The Mental Health system in the USA, as far as getting help initially, is fundamentally flawed. We are ignored , at society's peril......... Hi ,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to get straight to the point. Mental Health treatment in it's current iteration here in the USA is fundamentally broken/flawed. A person in crisis, essentially, cannot simply ask for help and receive any in return. A person has to make a scene &amp; spectacle of themselves, threatening to harm themselves or others. The fatal flaw in this system is that many people, MANY PEOPLE, are pushed to the edge, and end up killing themselves or others, after having the door slammed in their face so many times, simply because they didn't put on a show for mental health workers.

940,mentalhealth,1,"Verbal abuse and loss of feeling (On mobile) (apologies in advance for punctuation errors)

For some background I work as a commercial truck driver, by that virtue I'm pretty isolated and only stay in contact with direct family and a few friends. 

I'll try to summarize, I met a much younger woman then me online around February of last year, we hit it off pretty well, talked a lot about music, shows, and psychology. She was very shy at the time but very sweet, found out from her that her family also worked in trucking, so they understood what my lifestyle was. Everything seemed to be going okay, I had met the family, the dad seem apathetic but I wasn't rude about it (we work crazy hours and he worked overnight). 

We hung out at her parent's house a few times, and that was pretty uneventful, I do remember sometime in either May or June where I was scrolling through facebook and one of my close friends posted something naughty and kind of cute, (which was stuff we'd been sharing for over a decade at this point), and she got upset with the sexuality of the image and pulled me into her room, apparently she was very jealous of the gif. This should have set my red flags off right there. From then on it was some good times, permeated by her being upset about things I reacted to on FB or watched, a constant self loathing diatribe about how everyone was more attractive then her, and no matter how much a protested what she said, she would just ignore what I said. 

Things had been up and down until around November, she had been doing much better with the social comparison and anxiety, and we had talked about having a child together, around that time we decided to go through with it, around mid November she came back positive, everything was actually progressive very nicely, we were in good spirits. Then it happened, early in December, she brought up my close friend that I'd known for over 15 years (she'd brought her up multiple times before as justification for me cheating), and proceeded to yell, spam, or otherwise shout at me for being a liar, cheater, scum, unworthy of fatherhood. I recognized that she really hadn't been disciplined at all throughout her early life and which led to her developmentally being behind, because her parents wouldn't sit her down and force her to continue her studies. Over the course of the argument she just kept going on and on repeating herself over and over, not listening to reason or anything I say, until I said I felt like striking her (I meant a slap, but she took it as punching or something else), because she wouldn't stop escalating and ignoring me, of course that was flipped to say I was abusive, and then retroactively said I was abusive to my exes (even though I never touched anyone). I'm pretty tall at 6'4"" and have dated pretty petite women all my life, and I already well know I could never get away with anything of the sort because who would people listen to? The tiny woman or the 6ft tall man? You get the idea. After that she just escalated to say she was going to put the baby up for adoption, with out any say from me, I was furious, because this time she had been starting arguments based on her own insecurities, and essentially expected me to just take it all and agree with everything. It took family stepping in to diffuse the situation. 

There were a few small arguments since then but nothing to serious, I'd been functioning okay, but early this past week she went nuclear over a post I made about my trans friend who had taken up cocaine and meth and fell off the face of the earth. The comic in the post was romantic, but I wasn't really paying attention to that (I cared about the acceptance part of it). I had posted it earlier in the day, she only saw it after getting online around noon, but she just started spamming, saying everything from being worthless, to saying I wanted to fuck that friend, to that she wanted to kill me, and again that I was vile, and scum, and unworthy. Her mom eventually calmed her down, and it seemed okay for a time, her parents took away her phone later because she was always looking up stuff that upset her or supported/fed her anxieties.

For me even just a day after the phone was gone, I started losing it, I was already a pretty battered and depressed person before all of this, I thought having a child would give me a sense of purpose and a reason to live, but something broke in me, I've never wanted to leave someone in the way I am now, her mother plays it off as Pregnancy Psychosis, but I can't handle being yelled at for not doing anything really bad. Being constantly accused of cheating and lying hit me all at once, I loved her, I thought she was beautiful, wanted to make her happy, but nothing ever seemed to be enough, and everything I did was either not said right or just wrong to her. I'm feeling severely disconnected and I am not feeling anything for the baby either, I just suddenly stopped feeling, and I don't know what to do about it.

I know everything is disjointed, but I feel very alone in my situation, I feel abused, and disrespected. It does feel as if everyone expects me to be the responsible adult, but would never let me be one. I feel rudderless and stagnant with not control over my life, even though I continue to do my job, eat and take care of myself.

941,mentalhealth,1,"After Years of Struggling with Depression I've Decided to Try and Make a Difference I'm spending the next month fundraising for an amazing Australian charity that helps with mental health, beyondblue. 

A little bit about me:

A couple years ago I was starting to notice a change in myself. I was lethargic, bored all the time and got annoyed at every little thing. I started just not caring about anything. It wasn't until one time driving home thinking I couldn't really care if a car hit me and I didn't make it out alive. I realized at that moment that I wasn't my normal self. I still didn't get help but took time of work and seemed to get better or so I thought with nothing popping up. Then my mum died suddenly while I was home and I went off the deep end. Everything crumbled around me and I didn't even know the worst would come a year down the track. I had a blow up at my boss and that was it, I broke down and went to the doctor who finally prescribed me medication. It took time but I felt much better, I still go through bad patches and sometimes really bad patches but as a whole I've picked up my life from where I was at.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright a little about my charity efforts:

I got an amazing response from my friends and family when I decided to post it on Facebook and I smashed my original goal of $500. I've still got a month to run on my fundraising so I'm really hoping to hit $1500 by the end with the amazing help of family and friends.

My fundraising consists of 2 fundraising events:

\- 24 hour stream on 14/2/2020 from 10am Western Australia Time

\- Fundraising Day at my sport club on 16/2/2020

&amp;#x200B;

How can you help?

\- Checking out beyondblue and the work they do.

\- checking out the 24 hour stream (don't mind you leaving once it's done, it's more about joining in on something that can help on the day)

\- Know of any gaming company that might help out with raffle donations? Please let me know as I would love to be able to do some giveaways 

\- If you are in Western Australia and would like to come to the charity day just contact me. I would love to meet you and have you come down for the day.

\- Just reading this post I hope it helps with anyone that is currently struggling.

I wish there was a way where we could connect more people together and focus more on the reality that we aren't as different as we may think. Mental health is something so personal and vulnerable to be able to share with our peers. 

I am determined to help with this stigma and emphasize that generating awareness is one of the most important parts of improving mental health among millennials. We have created a google form that asks a few questions regarding mental health and anxiety among this younger generation.

We will keep anonymity for every submission and want to be able to share these stories with those who may benefit from reading about other people's situations. We strive to create a community of people to help normalize talking about mental health and realize we are all humans who experience these things. Share this if you think someone can benefit from this in order to share their story!

948,mentalhealth,1,"My brain started telling me that there are definitely worms/maggots in my food. Insomnia rampant. Depression since a young age. Anxiety now as a 25yo and no real memory capability. I can’t focus on anything usually and sometimes I’m gungho AF, yet sometimes almost calm. 

No matter how totally wanting to die inside I am on that particular day (it comes and goes
Rapidly/regularly, I’ve had suicidal thoughts since I was in middle school) virtually no one can tell. Also, 22 weeks PREGNANT. I capitalized it because I feel that may be an important detail. 

And NOWWWWW. 

NOW WHAT DOES MY BRAIN DO? 

I see sesame seeds in my Kim bop and my brain is so convinced they are probably maggots or worms. 

Of course I know they aren’t, but sometimes it makes me not want to eat it anymore. I have to force myself not to stare and over analyze. Also noticed it with canned chicken, meat typically. Really specific foods. Maybe only for a few weeks now, but I KNOW they are not worms/maggots and I’ll make myself eat it anyways. Despite the uneasiness, the thought and stomach feels will pass quickly afterward. What is this. Why is this suddenly starting to selectively appear. Maybe linked to my intense stress levels?

I finally told my mom about my depression all these years, told her I tried seeing my counselor (but didn't), the time my uncle told me I should just think positive which made me not want to talk to anyone to get help, and how I felt like nobody would take me seriously if I did tell. How my mental health fucked my school life. 

But I didn't tell her about my self harm, about my suicidal thoughts, and other wack shit that my brain tells me. 

I want to get help. But it's been about an hour since I've told her and she's been silent. I'm afraid I'd have to just keep my mouth shut until college so I can get counselling.

My mom has talked to me about demons and demon possession since i was very young (eg a story of someone throwing themselves into a burning wood stove and burning to death while possessed) basically fear mongering that demons are bad, typical Christian stuff.....

957,mentalhealth,1,"Experiences with Psychiatric Emergency Programs? I’ve been ignoring hospitalization as a legit option as my parents have discussed in the past not wanting to admit me in concern that it would be on my “record.” Recently I’ve had friends and even a teacher suggest it, but I told myself that as long as my therapist hadn’t directly said something that I shouldn’t legitimately consider it.

958,mentalhealth,1,"[Update] I'm finally out of the mental hospital! I've posted on this subreddit for awhile about my deteriorating mental health, and I finally checked myself into a looney bin six days ago.  I thought I'd be there longer but it was almost a week so I guess that's long enough.  It wasn't the most fun experience but it wasn't terrible either.  I feel like I got a lot of help and I'm surprised that I feel better coming out of it than going in.

Things I disliked:

The strip search.  I tried to get out of it but the doctor and orderly performing it told me to ""just get it over with"".  Had to get totally naked for a minute, thankfully there was no shit like cavity searches.  It was uncomfortable for everyone I can tell from their faces and thankfully was over with in no time.  

The closed and sterile setting creeped me out.  Everything was so clean and so safe, its not what Im used to.  I know it's a hospital but it's still weird.

Bed times, as an adult I actually had a bed time.  Most of the time I didn't sleep and I didn't sleep much at all during the six days I was there, and would fall asleep during group therapy and even individual therapy lol.  I tried to leave my room at night and just walk around but was (politely) told by orderly I cant do that and they gave me more magazines and books to read than Ive read in years.  When you dont have a phone, things get really boring fast.

No cursing.  I was told this in the common area that I curse too much and to not use f bombs and to stop cursing like a sailor.  When I first refused, they threatened to take me back to my room.  And we were all adults.

The showers were communal.  Had to shower with three other guys, blegh it was not fun.

I had to make a pledge to not self harm and not attempt escape (I voluntarily went in but still needed a discharge to leave) and told me if I got violent and assaulted anyone, they would press charges.  I felt like I was in prison when they told me that.

They made me eat enough to stop losing weight, and the food was not very good.  They thought I might be developing an eating disorder.  Having to scarf down hospital food is not the most pleasant of experiences but at least they gave you a choice what to eat.  Ate a lot of seafood.


Things I liked:

I liked actually being able to talk to psychologists and psychiatrists all the time.  I thought they would be condescending and rude, but they were understanding and nice and they really wanted to help me.  I basically spilled my guts and told them everything, and they told me ways to deal with self-harm and tried meds on me that I'm now taking and are actually working, it frankly surprises me.

The orderly were actually very nice.  I asked the orderly who escorted me to my room what do I do to not be on their bad side, they said just don't get in trouble and we won't mess with you.  Surprisingly I had no bad experiences with them minus them telling me to stop cursing and one time disconnecting my phone because I wouldn't get off of it.  That was also an annoying aspect, I'd call my girlfriend or brother and they'd get mad if it was over 20 minutes.  Was very annoying not having my own phone.

The visiting hours were generous, my girlfriend visited me every day and it'd be for around an hour.  Helped me through the isolation.  I assumed it'd just be once a week and just be between glass like in a jail.  

I drew a lot.  A lot of group therapy was fun and stimulating, I thought it'd just be fruity nonsense I wouldn't be able to use.  But I drew a lot to express myself.  I guess kind of childish but I liked doing it.

The patients were nice, I was in a part with suicidal and self harm patients and they weren't mean or violent and my roommate was pretty nice, he was just 19 and he was going through a lot of rough stuff, we would talk sometimes after bed time for a few hours and we became pretty friendly.

I feel like the medication and the cognitive behavorial therapy has really helped me.  Only time will tell, but I think this was the right choice to make.

They told me not to hesitate calling back and checking myself in again if I need to, Im surprised they didn't want me out as soon as possible.

Overall, I'm glad I did it, but it still felt like I was in a cushier jail.  But I think it saved my life, for now anyway.

They set me up with a new therapist and psychiatrist and hopefully things work well with them.  So hey, I'm not dead, not yet anyway!

962,mentalhealth,1,"I think im dissociating I need help. I dont know what to do anymore.  I think I have a dissociative disorder. 

Im going to split this into 2 sections to make it easier. (1). A bit of background / growing up experiences and (2). how i feel

Please forgive my spelling or grammar or whatever im typing this on my phone at like 1:30 am

(1). Im just putting this here for background purposes weather it will give some sort of insight on how im feeling or not , i dont know.
growing up i didnt have the worst childhood or the most difficult but it still messed me up and i think this stems from that. 

Im a male in my early 20s now but At a young age i was diagnosed with pretty severe ADHD and later on really bad anxiety and depression. Growing up my parents were decent enough and i had a few friends like every kid but my mother and fathers work had us move later down the road.  I think i was like 6 the first time we moved. New school , new people , no family except my parents and my younger brother. Started making friends again then within the next year and a half we moved again. This kept up for a long time. we would move, settle down, id make a friend or 2 then wed move within 1-2 years, each move a couple hours away from where we lived before. In total we had moved 11-12 times from me being age 6-18. After about the 5th move i just kind of gave up trying to meet new people and make friends cause what was the point if i was probably just going to move again. I didnt have a phone or any real way to keep in contact with old friends except like one or 2 of them. So for a long time i would be that new quiet kid in the back of the class that wouldn’t talk to anyone and was only around for the grade. I became shy, isolated, and basicly antisocial even though the only thing i wanted was a friend that wouldnt be gone in a year. When i got to high school i was at a new school again and i got bullied alot and had a couple mental breakdowns that almost led to suicide and to top it all off my mother and father had started to fight alot and eventually got a divorce because my mother wanted to be a party animal and made dumb decisions. I moved again at the end of my sophomore year back to my home town where i finished off high school. My junior and senior years were actually ok (ok as in i didnt get bullied and i did actually talk to some people on ocassion) but when high school was over i fell out of contact with all of them. And i guess over the years i really fell behind in the social department because i even now have a kinda hard time communicating with people (little to no eye contact, slightly awkward, difficulty conveying emotions and feelings) i still talk to those 2 friends and they are my best friends but besides them no one else really knows who i am. I haven’t been in a relationship scene early middle school and i want nothing more than just to be loved, understood and feel alive again.

(2). I feel empty. I space out often and stare off into the distance with a blank mind alot. I feel disconnected from everything around me like everything is fake. Like how a movie or a video game feels looking at a tv screen and it doesnt feel 3d or have any depth just like a picture, thats how i feel when i look around.  I dont take in my surroundings fully. a bright and lively room feels the same as standing outside at night in the quiet.  My mind feels foggy like it is always on autopilot weather it be at work, talking to someone, or at home alone.  Its difficult to explain like my mind and body are separate sorta like if you were to sit on someones shoulders and they did everything you would do but you yourself aren’t actually doing it if that makes sense.  Ive felt like this for as long as i can remember.  I dont think its depression but i could be wrong. Ill still smile and feel emotions on rare occasion but not very often or for very long. And i know something is wrong because sometimes i get these moments of clarity where i look around and feel like im seeing everything and feeling the size and scale of the room but i loose my focus and it fades away.   

I don’t exactly get the best sleep at night (i say as i type this at 2:30 am) so i feel like that is a factor of some sort.  I hang out with some people now on occasion but it doesn’t make me feel any different. Even when i talk to by best buddies i feel the same.  I dont have any real motivation or feeling to push onward and it feels like im only doing it cause i have to.   I still dont drive cause im terrified that because of this im going to space out or feel disconnected while driving and hurt myself or even worse, someone else.   Id prefer to not see a therapist or psychologist as i have bad experiences with them not caring or not listening to me. I know they are not all like that but it has a sort of negative association connected to them for me because of past experiences unfortunately. If i really have to ill try again but id like to know if anyone has some sort of advice or just an opinion or thoughts on how i should go about this.

One day i woke up and i have no emotions, nothing. I have NO thought process, a VERY blank mind, like you know that voice inside your head? that internal monologue? I don't have one. I don't think ANYTHING at all, I don't feel ANY anxiety, and I can't connect with anyone or anything. It feels like im half asleep or on auto pilot all the time.  Basically, I feel stupid, have no feelings of anxiety, emotions or depression, just blankness, with no thoughts, I can't for the life of my understand OTHER people, like I have no theory of mind of other people, and I lack a thought process, I really can't compose a single thought in my head really, its like just blank, like a severe mental block. It makes me feel stupid, i can't follow tv shows, or process the emotions that they ""expect"" the viewers to interrupt to feel empathetic for the character. I just feel SOOO detached from life, like im literally not experiencing it. Before when I was hypervigilant I was OVERLY experiencing it, now its the opposite. Im a dofferent person , extremely suicidal, bad things happen to me

what does this lack of emotional/social/academic intelligence, and blank mind in sound like to you, PTSD or brain damage? I also have a HORRIBLE short term memory, like a gold fish, literally. Life has lost all its feeling, can't feel depressed, cant feel happy, cant feel sad, life is dull and flat, and empty, like nothingness.

I also feel VERY tired all the time, nothing excites me or gets me going (while when I was hypervigilant I was almost maniac), I can sleep FOREVER. I just don't FEEL like im in the world, I don't feel attached to my surrounds, its like my brains stopped integrating stuff, and I'm just some empty robotic shell.

It's like I'm not attached to my thought process, I can feel it going on somewhere, but I cant FEEL it, or get in sync with it, its like I'm outside of it, just numb and empty minded 24/7. Everything is like a movie and nothing matters. My life is like a box and im not a person. Ive lost my soul or something . Nothing stimulates me not even games or Tv. I cant laugh or ever have a moment where i feel like me or good. I look at things strange and empty. I feel trapped . Like im burried alive. I just want to live

Before this happened i was PERFECT. Really into spirituality, connected to god , had everything going for me and nothing wrong.i was so happy and into life now i just feel like darkness like evil. I didnt have any traumatizing events. I feel like a loser and that no one likes me, that they can see my negative energy or whatever this is and thing bad and wrong of me. Im not in reality and not aware of anything. I feel like im in a different world and the days are the same and keep going. Im in a relationship and dont feel anything. We fight everyday because i dont love him and im not me or in control and i do stupid things. I dont feel emotions or anything. I need help. I feel like i’ll be stuck like this and want to die. I feel like there’s something else here. If someone died who i knew i wouldnt feel anything or care. I cant get satisfied or anything its like im not alive or here. If i watch a video im completely blank and empty and i feel like i’m 5. I feel immature and as if i have autism or something (i dont). I need help im in a different reality. My minds empty and i mean it. Theres no self. I feel like theres this shiled around me where im in a different reality. I stare blankly into space and think of nothing. Im zoned out 24/7 and dont feel grounded or in my body.im going crazy every second, i have no control at all and no stimulation and feel so cut off from reality everything looks blank and slow. I feel so stuck i just want to die. I feel cut off from EVERYTHING, and every day and second is hell. Theres no grasp of anything, i feel like smashing things and going crazy. i ignore everyone because im blank inside and not in reality to be in a conversation or anything (not like i can). Im scared what this is. Im scared if its some negative energy, another dimension, lost my soul, my mind, im possessed, i wont ever be the same, my life going to hell and etc. no one could understand this or how it feels. If u talk to me i will literally say “... im not me” “if i were me...” and literally nothing. I have no self, no likes , interests or anything. I cant go out anywhere because its like nothing, completely empty, meaningless, and no feelings. I feel stuck in my head and not in the outside world. No drugs help, i dont feel anything. I dont feel relaxation from going in a hot tub, cuddling, or anything. I dont know what this is considering one day i woke up and felt this, but the first couple days and week i was just so confused and disorientated and acted so differently. I woke up felt like a slob, acted like a slob, was lifeless, ate CHIPS for breakfast and only ate junk food. I would never do that. I was always classy, clean, active, happy, at a high vibration and etc. i cant get turned on, horny, exited or anything. I feel so far from my mind and body and everything. Theres no days and every day is the same. This isnt normal. I get very violent and get into physical fights with my boyfriend and feel out of control.

970,mentalhealth,1,"struggling with emotional numbness About four months ago, I was banned from seeing my significant other (outside of a small amount of time after my HS lets out) by my mother because she found out that we were having sex.

I'm more forgetful, I feel less motivated to take care of myself, and I experience anxiety sometimes, but the thing that bothers me the most is the slowly progressing emotional numbness that's started to creep in since I wasn't allowed to see her.

971,mentalhealth,1,"After years of suffering, I finally have an appointment with a psychiatrist. I have been experiencing what I believe to be depression since grade 11, maybe even grade 10. I am in my third year of university now. When I tried to tell my dad back in high school that I thought I might be depressed he brushed it off as ""teenage angst."" I knew that teenage angst didn't make you want to kill yourself, but I felt so let down by the person I could usually turn to that I didn't pursue it further. After some horrible mental breakdowns in my first year of university I reached out to the campus counselors. While helpful, they of course couldn't diagnose me with anything and that has always been my issue. I don't think that people should rely on a self-diagnosis, but my opinion started to change the more people would refuse to help me and provide me with answers. I told my doctor before I started my second year at uni about the depression and he prescribed me anti-depressants. This was a fantastic step, and they help me a lot, but still having never been diagnosed I still felt like I had no answers. Being prescribed those meds, while a blessing, also seemed to be my curse as anytime I then tried to reach out to someone to try and get a diagnosis they would turn me away because I was already on meds. Apparently they had already done their due diligence and I would be a waste of their resources. At a check up I mentioned to the physician that I wanted a diagnosis and she told me I shouldn't bother.  It took crying on the phone with mental health services in my city to crying in my doctor's office to even get a referral. But it worked. I just got a call from a psychiatrists office and have an appointment with them next Tuesday for an assessment. 

I feel so much lighter all of a sudden, it's the only way I can describe it. There are certain services at my university and in my community that I can only access with an official diagnosis and I have managed to overcome every person who told me that it was a waste of time to get one. Yes, my medication helps me, but I have so many underlying issues that require more attention. Not to mention that I might also have something other than depression, or along side depression. Only a professional can tell me and by God I am so ready to find out.

Greetings, 

I have been working out (weightlifting) strenuously for the past 4-5 months. I have seen slight results in my visible muscle mass and even bigger results in my weight lifting capability. I have a friend that has been training me and we divide weekly workouts as follows:

Monday - Arms

Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday - Legs

Wednesday - Chest

Friday - Back

And we do abs and cardio at the end of every workout. 

I have never payed much attention to diet besides the casual ""look at nutrition labels and cringe but eat it anyway."" I don't know if I'm ready to bulk and I really don't want to spend money on meal prepping. To start off I want to start tracking my diet and see what kinds of nutrients I am in taking, which ones I am lacking, and which ones I'm exceeding. Then eventually get into some healthier habits to speed up results and avoiding plateau. 

Is there a specific tool, app, or website you guys use to track your diet? Preferably one that would be personalized and might help signal what I need more or less of. Also, I'd be interested to discover recipes or maybe other subbreddits that focus on healthy eating for those that work out.

981,Fitness,0,"Workout program help Hi,

**Background:**

I am a 34 year old Male currently weighing 99kg/218 lbs at 6 feet 3 inch / 190cm. My weighing machine estimates me at about 26% body fat. I used to be 108 kg at one point in 2017 which was the most I have ever weighed. I was tired of weighing so much and looking the way I did and so I started working out and counting and cutting calories. I was down to about 85kg/190lbs in August 2018. The workouts were mostly unstructured full body weights about 2-3 times a week and some functional cardio type exercises the other 2-3 days. At that point many things happened and since then I have managed to gain a lot of the weight back.

**Current workout and lifts:**

Currently I am doing the Kinobody Warrior Shred program by Greg Gallagher for the past 3-4 months. However I am eating about 1800-1900 calories only which is below the 2200 recommended in the plan while eating about 160g protein daily. The part that appealed to me about this regime was the fact that it was a 3 day/week program which is usually how much time I am able to spare with my work travel commitments. My work travel involves places where I do not have access to a gym. After having run this program about halfway I am still not sure if this is the best way to go.

Sometime in 2018 I had purchased Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 2nd edition and read it all. However after reading more on /r/fitness and other forums I felt like this program might not be the best idea to go with a cut. Hence I have not tried it yet. I was also looking at the PPL program which many recommended for people starting out but the 6 day/week requirement put me off as I know I won't be able to keep that up.

My current lifts are at:

Flat Bench: 55 kg x 8. 1RM estimate (Strong app): 68

Deadlift: 80 kg x 8 1RM estimate ( Strong app): 99

Squat: 90 kg x 6 1RM estimate ( Strong app): 105

Overhead Press: 50 kg x 6 1RM estimate ( Strong app): 58

**Help needed:**

I feel like there is better more structured approach that I can possibly take to getting fitter and looking better and which is why I am posting here. I have read the wiki multiple times and have gone through all the recommended routines etc. also but am confused which would best apply to me. My goals are predominantly about looking better and not about how much I can lift or how strong I am.

Which program would be most suited to my needs looking at the 3/4 workouts per week limitation? Should I try 5/3/1 or GZCL and stick to it? If yes, which of the variants? Should I try PPL and just do as many workouts as I can per week? Should I just stick to the WSP plan I am currently doing? Do I need to add cardio to my workout regime?

As far as diet goes I think I want to cut till I can get to the 80kg/176 lbs region and then think about bulking up.

986,Fitness,0,"Keep cardio in my workouts while bulking up? Hey everyone,

I'm pretty inexperienced at weightlifting (I know what I'm doing in the gym I just can't lift much lol) and am looking for a little advice on workouts to build some muscle. I'm 20 years old, 6'0"", 150ish pounds, so obviously pretty skinny. After doing a bit of research it looks like my best bet is going to be bulking up, as it's probably unhealthy to try to lose any weight and I don't have a whole lot of muscle that that would reveal anyways.

I've been going to the gym for the past month or so (about 3 times per week), and usually alternate upper body and lower body lifting followed by some cardio (swimming, rowing machine, biking). I feel good about doing cardio, but my big question is if it's hurting any muscle gains? Is it a waste of time and just burning calories that would be better used to help restore/build my muscles?

Additionally, I looked into a macronutrient calculator ([https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/macronutrients\_calculator.htm](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/macronutrients_calculator.htm)) which tells me I should be consuming about 200 grams of protein per day. That's insane to me. I don't keep track of my diet at all, but I know I'm not eating anywhere near that (probably less than 100g but I don't really know). Am I wasting my time weightlifting if I'm not consuming massive amounts of protein? I'm not really a huge eater, so going crazy with chicken/eggs/yogurt makes me feel like I would just get fat.

992,Fitness,0,"Training for optimal physique/aesthetics/proportions Hey,

Before I begin, I just wanted to share that I think this may be hugely downvoted; however, I do not know of any other subreddits so sorry.

Briefly, my fitness journey began \~12 years ago, just before I entered high school. Prior to that, I was a bit overweight/fat, but my teenage-self knew that girls liked fit guys so I started to workout and eat healthily. Since then, I have been a gym rat, but admittedly one that has been running around kind of ""blind"". Even though I managed to shave \~40lbs from my highest weight back then, and now standing at 5'8/9% BF/145lbs (being short sucks), I still feel like I haven't achieved my desired body, but I don't know what that is.

What I do know is that I don't want to look too bulky - ""a bowling ball"". Additionally, I play \~8-10 hours of basketball per week (mostly after working out).

I currently follow a 6-day training split (basketball isn't factored in). The gym serves as a healthy, positive outlet for me, both physically and mentally, so I spend quite a bit of time there despite my frenzied work and graduate school demands. 

My main focus is to look really good (I have self-proclaimed OCD so even the slightest details matter), while having the capacity to perform in all other areas of life. Also, basketball is huge to me, and despite my shorter stature, I have a nice 3-point shot, which is something I don't want weightlifting to hinder.

Something that is weird to me is working out to ""maintain"", since I always had general goals, whether it was losing fat, weight, or getting tone. 

As I type this, I have no idea what the intentions of this post are. 

Should I curate my own program that addresses what my needs are? For example, hypertrophy in the upper chest, strength in arms/shoulders, hypertrophy in abs, strength in legs, and whatever it may be?

I guess where I am getting at is, can I curate a program that combines both hypertrophy and strength training to specific muscles that I want to work on? Should I just chill a bit back on the gym (I don't really want to do this because I get really lethargic, ultimately affecting all the other things that I have to do).

Additionally, are there specific workouts/routines that are known to bolster the ideal physique?

Idk - this post may be unnecessary lol, but I kind of wanted some more structure.

995,Fitness,0,"Has anyone tried the FST-7 Program? Hello everyone.

Recently I have been acquainted with the FST-7 program and have already tried a day or two on it. The program is supposed to emphasize hypertrophy above all else which is my ultimate goal and at the end of working out one muscle section one is supposed to do 7 sets of 8-12 reps. The other sets however typically lists 3-4 sets of 5-8. 

The program is vague on how one should approach these sets however. I am wondering what weight one should shoot for for the different sets? My thought would be the 5-8 would be heavier and the 7 sets of 8-12 would be somewhat lighter but there's no way to tell. 

Overall im receiving conflicting information on how heavy or light the weights are to be with some saying that its supposed to be heavier and other sources saying lighter. Additionally, my guess for the 5-8 sets would be to start lighter and hit 8 then 7 then 6 going marginally heavier? 

Another thing that I am confused about is rest periods. The 7 sets are clear the rest should be no more than 45 seconds between them but the others say 1 minute to 3 minutes. Is this not a bit long? My thought would be that minimal rest is better for hypertrophy.

This is probably a case of overthinking it but if there is anyone out there who has done this program before, how did you approach it?

1001,Fitness,0,"The 1h DB row (with bench support): two ways of doing it or a figment of my imagination? Hello fitness people!

Since I began doing this exercise as a part of a programme soon a year ago, I fell in love with it almost right away (everyone has their favourites), but after wondering ""if I'm doing it right and are my results (lifter %) on strengthlevel.com real?"" for several months, I finally decided to ask you guys! As my main focus with fitness is kayaking, it's extra important to me to get my rowing exercises done properly.

Basically what I would like to have confirmed or debunked is the following: the way I see it, based on information online (mainly Youtube ""how-to""-videos) and my personal experience doing the exercise, is that it can be divided into two ways of doing it, with both appear to be considered to be the right way. I'm only describing the part(s) that differ and I would like clarity on, not for instance feet positioning.

In the one case (#1) the movement consists of the elbow doing an arc upwards to be level with the lat and in some cases going higher, so that instead the DB is level with the lat. This to me feels like the movement engages the triceps as well.

On the other hand (#2), another way of doing the exercise appears to be a simple upwards movement of the elbow so that the DB touches the pectoral. This movement to me feels like it engages the biceps as well.

In How-to vid's and in my book(s) for demonstrative purposes the DB used is quite (IMHO) light. In addition, when lifting a heavy DB the size of it makes it impractical to lift it beside the body (case #1)

What I would like to know is

1. Have I misunderstood this exercise completely?
2. If my goal with the exercise is to train my back (targeting the lats), am I doing it right?
3. There isn't two ways of doing the exercise, it's all in my head and I've been obsessing over nothing and wasted your time reading this.

My Favorite workouts are deadlift and squats. I need to work on my bench press. I started with light weights making sure my form was on point and when i felt comfortable i started adding weight. I’m on my last phase of my lean bulk and will be starting my cut next month.  

Diet:
My diet consist of high protein, moderate carbs and fats. I usually eat oats and protein shake for breakfast, grilled chicken breast or tuna + veggies and rice for my 2nd and 3rd meal and i like to eat protein bars as a snack. Also having enough sleep is a key to success as it helps in muscle recovery. 

Thoughts:

To be honest, the hardest thing about working out is not knowing when to start. From my experience, the best time to start is now. And if you stay commited and consistent you will reach your goal. I would like to thank you guys for inspiring me and for helping me reach the best version of my self.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I should preface this by saying that getting stronger and getting bigger are both important to me, however, I would say a lean slightly more towards wanting to focus on gaining mass. Programs that are structured using the 5/3/1 method are more appealing to me because I just enjoy lifting low rep high intensity. I have had a couple of injuries in the past due to being an ego lifting, Gumby look-a-like, but over the last year I have really started getting into a groove and really improving with my lifting. 

&amp;#x200B;

One injury I have had in the past was on my lift hip. I had some tendinitis in my hip which meant I was unable to squat for a long period of time. A month or so ago I decided that I would start squatting again, and only my second back squat session back, I felt the slightest sensation of my hip flaring up again so I thought I would have to ease off the squatting again. Funnily enough, I realised that when I did my accessory front squats on a Thursday, I didn't have the same nagging issues as I did with back squats. Ever since I have replaced all back squatting with front squats, and I have to say I find it so much more enjoyable/comfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of my lack of squatting, my lower body has really started lagging behind my other lifts. I was really really skinny when I started out lifting, and doing little to no legs has really messed me up. My whole lower body is a weak point, but I would say that my glutes and hamstrings are lagging further behind that my quads are. Another weak point (aesthetically) I have is my upper chest. I have made pretty good progress with my bench press (45kg - 85kg) but I would definitely say that my upper chest looks pretty hollow.

&amp;#x200B;

# My Questions 

When switching to BTM, I would like to only do front squats. This will shift the main focus of my leg training to my quads which will be detrimental to my already lagging hamstrings and glutes. Can/should I offset this with the addition of Romanian Deadlifts and/or Hipthrusts? If so, where would you suggest I add them in and with what sort of volume/intensity? I'm having a hard time trying to figure out if this will burn me out, or if it will even really be a problem in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Second. I wouldn't mind changing the flat bench press to incline to help address my lagging upper chest, but I wouldn't want it to effect my progress on flat bench (In terms of 1RM). Has anyone had any experience with only incline benching and if it had any effects on their flat bench 1RM? My main concern is that I lift about 20kg less on incline than flat, so in my head I'm thinking it could possibly reduce my flat bench 1RM (I have no experience in this so I could be wrong)

&amp;#x200B;

1015,Fitness,0,"My experiences starting lifting - M17, 169cm (5' 6.5""), 63.5kg (140lbs) - and a couple of questions about progression.  I started lifting around September time 2019, although I was in good shape beforehand. I wanted to get a little bit bigger, bit mainly just stronger whilst staying lean. My initial 1RMs for each exercise were:

Bench: 57kg (125lbs)

Deadlift: 95kg (210lbs)

Overhead Press: 35kg (77lbs)


I did do squats but I have recently stopped due to knee issues which I do not want to worsen.

For the first couple of months up to Christmas, I ran 5/3/1 for my main lifts and mixed and matched accessory work, including bits of bodyweight various arm work. In terms of diet, I wasn't specifically bulking or cutting but I'd consider my diet to be pretty healthy. By Christmas my 1RMs had progressed to 71 (155), 110 (240) and 45 (100) on bench, deadlift and OHP respectively. 

At this stage I decided to have a go at writing my own programme. 5/3/1 had worked pretty well (although I'm fairly confident in my assumption that almost anything would have worked since I'm so new) so I based it off the same structure. The program is a 3 week cycle and I generally work out three days a week, doing each of my three main lifts twice:

Week 1
5x80%
2-4x85%
1+x90%
3 sets of 5x60-70%

Week 2
5x80%
2-4x85%
1+x95%
3 sets of 5x65-75%

Week 3
5x85%
2-4x90%
1+x100%
3 sets of 5x70-80%

All the percentages are of my 1RM, and where a range of reps or weight is given I judge this by exercise and how my body feels (e.g deadlift sets are usually on the lighter end of the range otherwise can barely walk the next day). I do a variety of accessory work after these lifts, I keep a note and try to keep progression fairly steady. I have a few bodyweight/calisthenics goals in mind as well as just keeping my general conditioning high with this. I've currently been running this for one cycle whilst on a bit of a mini cut to mitigate the damage from Christmas, but at the end of my first three weeks I managed two reps of my max weight on bench and deadlift plus three on OHP.

Here is a pic:  http://imgur.com/a/FQAiCzE

So far I've really enjoyed the ride, and just want to thank the community for giving me the info I needed to get started. I think my biggest weakness is that I haven't yet managed to commit to a long enough period of bulking or even have run the same program for long enough to know what really works for me - but that's a work in progress (I've got a 2 month bulk planned starting February). 

*I also have a question regarding my programs' progression: I plan to increase the weight I lift by 1-5kg on every set (i.e *not* increase my 1RM and recalculate percentages), and for my first cycle am thinking 3kg (6.5lbs) for bench, 4kg (9lbs) for deadlift and 2kg (4.5lbs) for OHP. First of all, is this a sensible plan or would it be more sustainable to increase every two cycle; and secondly, are those numbers sensible?*

1017,Fitness,0,"Rest times and breaking up training Currently running a ppl split, goal being hypertrophy. 
The other day I got to the gym all set to do a typical pull routine. I did my rows and my pulldowns, and then got a phone call from a friend that needed a ride. I had to cut my routine short, leave the gym and go pick him up.
About 3 hours later, I had some free time and really wanted to finish my routine (at least the bicep portion), but didn't feel like driving all the way back to the gym. I did the bicep portion of the workout at home. I used the exact weight of dumbbells that I typically use at the gym to come close to failure around 16 reps, however since my arms were now fresh from my 3 hour break, I was able to get 24 reps with a few left in the tank. I was able to go up in weight by 5 pounds each and still make it to 16 reps with good form. I probably could have gone even heavier, but I don't own every size dumbbell.
My questions are: I've seen tons of studies about rest times comparing 60 seconds, 2 mins, 3 mins of rest, but what am I missing out on by doing biceps 3 hours later? If my schedule allows, could I make better arm gains by splitting my workout in two parts like this? Could this actually just be telling me that I'm getting too much bicep involvement in my rows or something? 
I'm going to try it again tonight by doing rows and pull downs, then 30 mins of LISS on the treadmill, and then my biceps. 
P. S. I put my dumbbells on a scale and they're accurately labeled, so it's probably not just a difference in the weight. I will not be bringing my scale to the gym to weigh their dumbbells.

In fact, he says this behaviour can lead to “exercise induced inactivity. Basically, your body is saying you’ve gone and hunted, you’ve got the wildebeest, you’ve killed it, you’re sitting down, you can eat. And your metabolic rate actually drops.”  
&gt;

1019,Fitness,0,"Replacing squats with RDLs and split squats? I'm a casual lifter that doesn't compete, with a 5RM of 315lbs and I'm thinking of replacing the squats because I don't see what the squat is doing for me.

1. After squats on squat day, my CNS is fried and my lower back is fatigued to the point where I can't do another heavy compound or quality accessory movements. I can only do seated accessories or stuff on the smith because I'm just so tried. 

2. I know the squat works a lot of muscle groups, but I don't feel like it has really improved anything in particular - i.e. rack pulls and hip thrusts have really helped my hip hinge and deadlifts have really helped my hamstrings. 

3. I'm not getting enough focus on my quads and I feel like I'm not getting enough volume because I do 5x5 (sometimes less when I'm going for triples or a single) and again I'm too tired to do quality accessory movements. 

4. I've tried replacing it with safety bar squats, which has helped because I can still do another compound like the rack pull afterwards because the SSB takes some of the stress of your lower back. However I have the same issues as the regular squat. 

I want to replace squats with RDLs and split squats. 

In this case, should I replace the squat?

#Workout

I decided to go with a full body workout routine, where I did a full body workout 3 times a week. Every day there was an five exercises, one for each category: push, pull, legs, curl, extension. “Push” targeted chest and shoulders. “Pull” targeted the back and shoulders. “Legs” worked all the leg muscles and the core. “Curl” targeted the bicep and forearm. “Extension” targeted the tricep and backarm. 

[Workout Chart](https://imgur.com/5aNLyUz)

**Day A:**

* Run (3 Miles)
* Bench Press (3 x 5-10)
* Barbell Row (3 x 5-10)
* Squat (3 x 5-10)
* Bicep Curl (3 x 5-10)
* Tricep Press (3 x 5-10)

**Day B:**

* Run (3 Miles)
* Incline Bench Press (3 x 5-10)
* Seated Row (3 x 5-10)
* Deadlift (3 x 5-10)
* Hammer Curl (3 x 5-10)
* Cable Pulls (3 x 5-10)

**Day C:**

* Run (3 Miles)
* Dumbbell Press (3 x 5-10)
* Lat Pulldown (3 x 5-10)
* Hack Squat (3 x 5-10)
* Cable Curl (3 x 5-10)
* Overhead Extension (3 x 5-10)

I started with a 3 mile run on the treadmill for a full 30 minute cardio workout. Then I followed up with strength training, doing progressive overload for each exercise around 70%-90% of my maximum rep. If I could do 3 sets of 10 consistently on an exercise, it means it was time to bump up the weight. Strength training took about 30 minutes, which means I spent a total of one hour to one hour and fifteen minutes at the gym. Considering I was only going to the gym 3 days week, this routine provided a perfect work-life balance.

#Diet

I originally tried keto for two weeks, but I was constantly hungry, tired, dizzy, and sometimes I wanted to vomit. I gave up and did some research. I came across The Harvard Food Pyramid (not the same as the FDA Food Pyramid), which gave a simple eating guide that was based on science.  

[Harvard University Nutrition Guide](https://imgur.com/a/ngeHP0H)

* 3+ Serving Of Whole Grain Carbs
* 2-3 Servings of Fruit
* 2-3 Servings of Veggies
* 2+ Servings of Meat 
* 1-2 Servings of Diary
* 1-3 Servings of Nuts
* Include Plant Oils (Such As Olive Oil)
* Use Sparing Added Sugar, Butter, White Bread

This diet is very simple to follow. I reduced my intake on soda, beer, and candy to around once a week. I replaced my white bread with whole grain bread, white rice with brown rice, white pasta with whole grain pasta, and added oatmeal to ensure my diet was high in fiber. Fun fact: Fiber will always keep you full. I eat protein every meal, usually eggs, milk, and/yogurt. I have some sort of meat, whole grain carbs, and veggie for lunch and dinner, with dinner usually having two servings of meat (for protein) and veggies (for vitamins). And I snack on healthy foods in between meals such as nuts, granola bars, and fruit. I always make sure I stay hydrated with water. 

Here is a typical eating day for me. Breakfast: Oatmeal, Eggs, Yogurt, and Banana. Lunch: Tuna Salad Sandwich on whole grain with Broccoli and Orange. Snack: Almonds. Dinner: Two pieces of Chicken Breast, Brown Rice with curry, Sweet Potato, Black Beans, and Mix Veggies. I didn’t count calories, carbs, or macros. Additionally, I didn’t do protein shakes or supplements. I just made sure that I got my servings of food and all of the important nutrition I need would fall into place.  

#Conclusion

Here Are My Current Maximums:

* **Bench Press:** 84 kg (185 lbs)
* **Squat:** 113 kg (250 lbs) 
* **Deadlift:** 104 kg (230 lbs)

Overall, I am really happy with these results. This subreddit gave me a lot of useful information and seeing the transformations post keep me inspired. I may end up switching my routine by going the gym 4 days week and see what other exercises I can include.

1042,Fitness,0,"My 3 and a half year journey. 75kg - 100kg Hi Reddit, my first post ever on here so please bare with.

Male - 22 - 6'2.5 (190cm) - 100kg(\~220lbs)

[BEFORE (ples dont mind my ugly face)](https://imgur.com/a/RpuCLCi)

[AFTER](https://imgur.com/a/7I5LMx3)

**Intro**

Firstly, i've never been bothered about how my body looked, and no one really said anything against how I looked, however, it was always about my strength. I went to a boy school so things got physical there, and my strength was challenged a lot; so much so that people were surprised if I lifted something fairly heavy. So being strong was my aim. I was always active and played football, cycling and jogging a lot, but little to no weight lifting.

I was 18 when I started, which was the year I was going to University, I specifically waited for this year as I would have more free time and be more independent in what I ate and how I lived my life. I lived at my uni campus (2 hour drive away from home).

**2016-2017 - Skinny Noodle**

With little to no research - I started a ""bro split""kinda work out (I hit each body part once a week). I thought I was strong, and to be fair I think I was. I was benching around 50kg for 6/7 reps during the end of 2016. My back was definitely strong (through back rowing, one arm row, pull ups -6reps ). The highest I could deadlift was 90kg. I tried to DL 100kg in front of my uni mates and I kid you not, I nearly passed out.

My diet in 2016 - 2017 was appalling now looking back. I did not track my calories until 6/7 months after I started gym. It was definitely below the recommended. And I ate a lot of processed food. I started my first cut 6/7 months in as I just wanted to look like I had muscle, which was a mistake. My main foods consisted  of:

* Eggs
* chicken
* meatballs
* green veg
* porridge (with a scoop of mass gainer )
* wholemeal bread

In conclusion, 2016 was a massive learning curve for me, spent countless nights watching YouTube videos, researching how the body works, and meals which guaranteed the best gains.

Weighed 78kg

**2017-2018 - The year of the vicious bulk**

After around a year of going through mistakes in mainly my diet; I started to find out what works well for my body, the best routines etc. Major changes I made was body split to PPL(push pull legs). Followed a 5x5 type training. Removed all processed foods apart from shakes. And now incorporated fruit smoothies with a scoop of whey. NOW LET THE BULK BEGIN (6+ month bulk)

Followed a strict PPL. 5 days a week &gt; 2 rest. Then the following week, 6 days a week &gt; 1 rest. Repeat.

I ate 5 meals a day :

* Weetabix with peanut butter
* Wholemeal bread with eggs
* Wholemeal bread, ham and cheese ""toastie"".
* Fruit smoothie with 1 or 2 scoops of whey
* Rice/Pasta with chicken/tuna and veg

I was easily eating around 3300cal a day. Going to the gym 5/6 times a week for months. Slept 8+ hours a day, except the days we went clubbing.

**Until...**

I was incredibly fatigued for at least 5 days. My body was in so much pain and it hurt to even walk long distance, my muscles wanted to retire. I crashed bad; and that is when I found out that you're supposed to take a week break around every 3 months.

My exercises exploded as I was on this bulk - Benched 90kg for 5 reps, squat - 110kg for 5 reps, barbell rows - 60kg. I had to say bye to pull ups as my additional fat made it harder to lift my body weight. Moreover, I barely trained my arms compared to chest for some reason, so I plateaued.

In conclusion - people noticed how strong I was getting, and I had a few compliments of my  transformation compared to the previous year.

Weighed 90kg

**2018 - 2019/20 - Ultimate comeback**

At this point I was well aware of what I was doing in the gym. I knew/know near enough all there is to bodybuilding, and it was just a case of being patient and making sure I met my macros. At this point I had just gone through a cut and I looked shredded than i've ever been. Was even surprised at the veins I had on my abs, but all i wanted to do was to be strong so I went on a soft bulk; 100cal above maintenance and some days just ate maintenance but made sure I had enough protein and fats. Rotated between 4x6 training an 8x3 training around every 2/3 months.

My lifts towards the end of the year were:

* Bench Press - 100kg for 5
* Barbell Row - 90kg for 8
* Deadlift - 210kg for 2
* Squats - 150kg for 5
* OHP 50kg for 8

My diet stayed pretty much the same. 5 Meals a day:

* 2 \* Fruit smoothie with whey (\~500cal each)
* Rice and tuna
* Peanut butter jelly (for the fats ;)
* Dinner

In conclusion - ""we're in the end game now"".

Weighed 100kg

**What I've learned (positives and negatives)**

* Compound movements are the biggest priorty
* Diet before anything - your body reacts to it sooooo easily
* Rest is very very important
* CONSISTENCY
* You actually grow when you're not going to the gym, so your body can finally rebuild what has been teared.
* I sweat so easily it's annoying.

**Next goals**

* 105kg
* Bigger calves (the bane of my life)
* Better cardiovascular health

What's the point of having people guess your body fat?

1045,Fitness,0,"Does anyone do an ""eccentric big four"", or similar? Hey all,

Thanks for the time.

Recently, through the course of injury rehab, I've become a convert to church of eccentric exercises - currently for calf and hammies.

From my experience, body weight eccentric exercises have been crazy beneficial for my flexibility, muscle hangover, and muscle tension. So I was wondering if people ever incorporate a dedicate eccentric routine to target muscles in the same way a lot of people focus on the big 4 for concentric exercise? and if so, how do you about doing so?

I'm still figuring out the best way to do these for some groups, but seems to me it's as beneficial, if not more so, than post-workout stretching.",doe eccentric big similar hey thanks time recently course injury rehab convert church eccentric exercise currently calf hammies experience body weight eccentric exercise crazy beneficial flexibility muscle hangover muscle tension wondering people incorporate dedicate eccentric routine target muscle way lot people focus big concentric exercise doing m figuring best way group s beneficial post workout stretching
1046,Fitness,0,"Is there any benefit of actual overhead tricep movement, as opposed to just working the long head upright with other movements? Really can't seem to google up the answer I'm looking for exactly. I constantly do reverse curls, dips, and push downs. I know I'm getting plenty of long head work, but after 4 years of training I've yet to find an overhead movement that actually activates my long head better than any of those options or just outright feels comfortable.

Skull crushers are decent but incomparable to the previously mentioned, for me at least. Overhead cable work feels awkward no matter how many times I revisit it with a rope or single hand grip, and likewise with overhead DB extensions. All of them always feel awkward and are lackluster in activation for me.

Is there really any reason to revisit overhead work here, or any recommendations from people that were in a similar boat?

**Edit:** if this gets archived and anyone is looking at it.

The consensus seems to be that you can only reach the maximum stretch point of the tricep with overhead movements but none the less if you dont do overhead movements your missing out on a insignificant percent of gains.

My last 2 push days I've revisited skull crushers at the end of the workout with really low weight, 30-50 pounds, and just focused on going really slow like people have mentioned.

I've also added overhead rope extensions, but I am pulling from above the head rather than the floor. Again, at the end, light weight, and really slow.

I think I'm going to keep this up on top of my regular tricep work for a few months.

1048,Fitness,0,"My one-year Fitness journey – 295 to 224 M 21

6’4 (193.04 cm)

295lbs (133kg) to 224lbs (101.6 kg)

[Here’s a pic but I’m really awkward for photos so don’t mind the strange faced selfie](https://imgur.com/nD8LJVd)

This has been one of the longest years of my life but not even because of the weight loss. I wanted to make a mini post on how my year has affected me besides just my weight. These are all the things that I did a little air fist bump because it was such an annoyance to me. 

At the start of my weight loss journey I focused on cardio and did some basic strength machines, I did these 4 to 5 times a week. When I started, I sucked at running, I played football and threw in track, so I was only taught how to lift and never focused on extended running. The first month was me just working my way up to 3.1 miles because I wanted to start running in 5ks. I think to work for a goal that seemed more easily achievable at the time rather than just focusing on losing weight helped in the beginning. I ran a lot and eventually I began to enjoy it. I got to the point where 3.1 miles (5km) in 30 min, was no longer soul sucking, around that time my weight plateaued. That’s when I began running 5 miles to toughen my workout and that was where I went wrong. I learned that pushing yourself the absolute limit is not the only way to go. I was at the gym for almost 2 hours an hour for running and an hour of machines and I wasn’t losing as much weight as I usually did. 

It wasn’t until last August where I decided to look at what I ate a bit more. Like I said earlier, in Football as a lineman I was told to “eat eat eat”, “be an animal”, “get huge”, and was led to an unhealthy diet. I started limiting my portion sizes to just be smaller. At this time my weight plummeted, I was losing around 10 pounds (4.5kg) a month and I didn’t even count calories, I just started to think, I don’t need that much. I only started counting calories a couple of months back because I think I’ve gotten to the point where my body doesn’t have an unlimited amount of energy anymore, some days it was incredibly hard to finish a run and I just felt shitty. So, I started to make sure I eat around 1300 to 1500 calories a day and eat a little more before I work out. 

I wanted to list some little accomplishments that seem small but was huge to me. 

· I sweat less when running. I would sweat for almost an hour after running, now it stops immediately.

· All my clothes from middle school fit me now, so now I have some extra clothes.

· Some girls flirted with me at a party, that felt nice.

· I catch my breath much faster than I did before, IDK if it's possible to not feel winded walking up a huge hill to class.

· I can see muscles now especially my arms and back

· I look a lot better.

Now here are some things that I don’t like about my new healthy lifestyle

· I have my meals thought up for the entire week, a random friend’s trip to get food stresses me out now.

· Most of my clothes don’t fit and as a college student, I can’t just buy new clothes.

· Even though I lost so much weight I feel like I’m not as satisfied as I thought I would be. 

· Seeing my weight loss slowed down is slightly disheartening.

· It’s the minority but I do have some friends that make me feel bad for not eating with them

· I kind of feel flimsy now, I used to “feel” big and strong.

· I only recently have gotten back into lifts but I’m really weak now.

· On some subreddits I follow, I get a little jealous when I see someone lose so much more weight than I, some people are losing over 100 pounds in a year wtf.

1049,Fitness,0,"From advice - How hard should one retract scapula during bench press? After a recent shoulder issue (tendon strain), I'm reassessing my pressing form and trying to make sure I retract my shoulders enough. I've always made sure to retract my scapula while benching, but maybe not tucked my shoulders down enough (activating my lats). I'm now packing my shoulders back and down way harder than I used to, to the point where I feel a lot of strain in my upper back and lats while pressing and I'm wondering exactly how hard should one be retracting the scapula?

I posted this earlier but because my account is pretty new and it had a lot of activity so my account was put in the spam list by a bot.

Hopefully this doesn't cause a problem to anyone. 

[Before and after](https://i.redd.it/877betlk97941.jpg?1)

Note: English is not my first language so please try to ignore the grammatical errors and correct me so that I can improve. Thanks. 

I Started going to the gym on 31 Dec' 2018 and today it feels like I have actually achieved something in my life. Gym became my new life, never skipped a single day and never skipped a good night's sleep. Lots of mistakes were made and I learnt a lot from them.

**Athletic background and genetics** 

Played football for 8 years straight from the age of 8 to 16. 

My mom and day are very fit. My father was in the army when I was born and my mother has always been slim (5'3"" Under 50 KG probably). 

**Diet** 

It was so difficult to calculate the calorie intake because I always ate whatever my mom cooked at home but anyway I did it one day. It turned out to be 2700-3000 which I am pretty sure is definitely not accurate. 

About the protein, I drink 800-1000 ml of milk everyday, and I get the rest of my protein from pulses, eggs (10 egg whites per day, started eating eggs from march), nuts, peanut butter and whey protein 25 gram scoop post workout and 15 gram scoop after waking up.

My diet game has always been week. Even after joining the gym I didn't eat much nutrient rich food. Sometimes I did sometimes I did not. To make up for my nutrient low diet I ate 5-6 times a day, 3 main meals and the rest being snacks (Heavily peanut buttered breads with 300ml of milk, eggs, etc) or sometimes proper meals. My main source of protein was always Milk, Yogurt (homemade), egg whites, pulses, etc. 

**Supplements** 

I never took any other supplement other than Protein and Creatine. 

I started using Whey Protein and creatine from June - July. In Oct I started taking Isolate Protein. Right now I am using Whey and stopped the intake of creatine.

**Training and mistakes** (mostly mistakes)

I trained single body part everyday and I still do that now. I only did the exercises that the Gym trainer told me.

I mostly exercised with the friends that I made at the gym. 

I started training my abs from March and have been training them everyday since then.  

In September I started to realise how bad (not so effective) exercises I have been doing since the beginning. In October I COMPLETELY changed my training schedule and started to understand how the body actually works. Until November I didn't even know which body part the exercises I used to do targeted.  

One of the biggest mistakes that I made was that I never did many compound movement exercises like Deadlift, weighted squats and Overhead press. I started these exercises in mid October and these are my current numbers: 

Numbers now vs numbers when I started in October

**Note** - The numbers below include the weight of the barbell. The barbell I use in every lift weighs 20 KG. 

**Deadlift - 150 KG × 2 rep max** from 110 KG 

**Overhead Press - 60 KG × 6 rep max** from 30 KG (I just realised I fucked up while posting in other subs. I calculated the weight of the barbell and only the weight of the plates on one side, totalling to 40KG. That's probably why everyone was  confused about my OHP being so low).

**Weighted Squats - 140 KG × 4 rep max** from 90 KG (Note: Before ever doing weighted squats I used to do Leg Press every week and my highest was 280 KG × 4 Reps). 

**Bench press - 90 KG × 6 rep max**  (Note:  I train my chest on Saturday and I am just so worn out from all the work and other things. Also, I do supersets while benching. I am pretty sure I can do 1 rep of 110 KG or maybe more)

Looking back at how used to train it was just horrible. Sometimes the sets per body part used to go 30+ and this was repeated so so many times. 

Also, I never ever did cardio even for 5 mins. 

My current training schedule is: 

Monday - [Back](https://youtu.be/eE7dzM0iexc) + Middle and Lower traps *(Y reverse prone raises and)*  w/Deadlift, Lower abs

Tuesday - [Shoulder](https://youtu.be/jv31A4Ab4nA) + Upper traps *(Barbell front and rear shrugs and Dumbbell side shrugs)* , Obliques 

Wednesday - [Legs](https://youtu.be/RjexvOAsVtI) w/Weighted Squats, Abs 

Thursday - [Triceps](https://youtu.be/tMyFe-IL7Ks) + Reverse inclined Kickback and Skull crusher, Lower abs

Friday - [Biceps](https://youtu.be/gozU3CUIizs) + Middle and Lower traps *(Standing cable Y raise and Reverse prone T raise)*, Obliques

Saturday - [Chest](https://youtu.be/89e518dl4I8) + Legs w/leg press, abs

I divided the same leg workout to two days and added extra exercises for calves each day.

Sets and reps - I only do 3 sets of each exercise (even if in the video it's mentioned 4 sets) and my rep range is 12, 10 and 8 with increasing weight in the next set. Before October I used to do 4 sets of each exercise and 15, 12, 10 and 8 reps. 

I train 6 days a week. 1.5 - 2 hours each day.

It took me a week to come up with this schedule, it's probably not the best but it's perfect for me right now. 

**Misc**

When I went to the gym I weighted 57 KG and now I weigh 73 KG.

I tried doing pull-ups on my first day and I was only able to do 3 half-assed pull-ups. But now I can do 30 (Max 35) clean pull-ups. I have been doing them in every two days since the first day.

People in other thread were really doubting how I got such shoulders because my OHP is so low and were accusing me of using roids. I have been doing dumbbell overhead press (25 KG max × 8 reps) since I started training shoulders. 

I did not use any roids or anything. It's upto you whether you want to believe it or not. 

I will only keep on pushing and get only better.

Thanks to my gym buddies for getting me where I am today.

1058,Fitness,0,"Airdyne Intensity how to improve.. Little history on myself. 47 years old, 5'7"" 165lbs lean and muscular for my age.  Exercised daily since I was 21 doing weights and running. Got to doing 5kms in 22mins from a cold start. Running partner died (my dog) and I quit running cold turkey and joined Brazilian Jiu-jitsu the day after he died. Trained BJJ everyday for 10yrs until my first daughter was born, then I took up running again a couple nights a week on a treadmill I bought and trained Jiu-jitsu the other days/nights. Second daughter born and I found I needed to start taking a day off here or there to be more involved with family in general. I obviously shifted gears and was simply busy at times with dishes, laundry, late nights.  I still managed to run/train 4/5 days a week.

Fast forward a few years and I'm still exercising 4/5 days a week with jiu-jitsu and now an Airdyne bike. I switched to an Airdyne as the running was taking its toll on my knees, ankles and hips. I have a tendency to give it everything every time. I was also diagnosed with a nerve condition. I'm always in some type of discomfort and some days are worse than others.  Sometimes I will take a week off the Airdyne and only teach my Brazilian jiu-jitsu class and not roll in it (not grapple). I switch up the amount I train and the days off based on how my nerve condition feels.

I've always done my Treadmill and Airdyne at home when the kids went to bed or they played. They watch and understand how committed I am to exercise and they now are high level Cheerleaders for their age groups. Last year they were on the same team and they won plenty of competitions and worlds.

Here's my question after my ""too much information explanation"".

I've been giving it everything I got on my Airdyne but my improvements are painstakingly slow.  Its been 3 years and I want the gains in calories burned to improve quicker. I use the calories burned simply as a marking tool for gauging my output.

Here's a few of my rides:

3min warm up, 20sec work, 10 secs rest, 8 sets, 5min cool down at a decent pace once I kind of recover from the Tabata

3min warm up, 10min as hard as I can ride

3min warm up 5mins all out, 2 min rest 5min all out, 2min rest 5min all out (doing this as it simulates World Brazilian jiu-jitsu masters divisions match length)

Any ideas to help me increase my output? More carbs, more protein, more rest, any input would be great.

1062,Fitness,0,"Are 7 hours of cardio a week ""OK""? I'm returning to fitness after falling off the wagon.  Honestly the only thing I care about is cardio.  Weight loss is a nice side benefit since it makes it lighter on my knees, but my main goal is simply getting enough cardio in.  So I started a C25K program like many do then kept going to a 10K goal.  I'm now up to 55 min runs.

I looked at the [r/c25k faq](https://old.reddit.com/r/C25K/wiki/faq).  I know it's not gospel, but two answers stuck out to me:

#### Should I skip rest days?

&gt; No. Assuming a M/W/F running schedule, T/Th/S/Su should be observed rest days. These are your sabbath days of running. Upper body work, cross training, and calisthenics are all okay during three of these days.

#### Can I reduce the number of rest days between weeks?

&gt; Yes, instead of having 2 rest days between weeks, it's fine to reduce it to only one.

OK... all clear so far.  In any month I can choose to run on all the ***odd numbered days*** and ""cross train"" on all the ***even numbered days***.  This is exactly what I do.  So, right now, I run for ~55 min on odd days and swim for ~55 min (don't judge) on even days.

I feel fine and my heart rate stays in the correct band for my (advancing / M49) age.  Despite all of this my fitness tracker is chastising me continually for doing too much anaerobic cycles.  Perhaps it's just an overly concerned AI.  But I feel I should check myself.

**My diet:**  I aimed for 2500-3000 calories a day but that was never consistent. I  never tracked carbs or fat but with my dirty bulk mentality I was  definitely taking in enough. Only thing consistent in my diet was 6 eggs  each morning for breakfast and Peanut butter sandwiches for snacks and  I'd normally down a protein shake after gym. Eggs, peanut butter and  milk are absolute super foods for teenagers trying to bulk... cheap and  tasty. As a teen who doesn't have complete control over my diet due to  money, this was easily the hardest part of gaining.

**Routine for the first 5 months:**  Had no idea what the heck I was doing at first and pretty much only  trained arms and chest. Eventually I ran a bro split I made myself after  copying the types of exercises fellow gym bros were doing. This  actually gave me nice progress but I ended up over training and not  allowing my muscle groups to recover properly.

Incline bench 4x6

Skull crushers 4x12

Chest supported rows 4x8-12

Hammer curls 4x12

Lat pull downs chin up grip 4x12

1068,Fitness,0,"10lb bumper plates not to be used alone? I'm 36 year old female that was previously athletic but is pathetically out of shape and very overweight/obese now. I'm starting Greyskull LP and pushing my relatively fit husband along with me.

I just finished setting up a power rack at home, and went with black Fringe Sport bumper plates after a TON of research. I didn't get the fancy Urethane ones, but I did want to protect my floor from accidental drops and the bumper plates have less rust potential. I picked out a 250 lb set, and realized after setup that I probably need a few more lower weight plates. 

To the point -- I went to review my options for 10s or 15s (I already have some 5's and 2.5's) and I saw a note on both Titan Fitness and Rep that the 10s are not supposed to be used without heavier plates because that will damage the plate. It didn't say *how* the plate would be damaged. I have no intention of dropping these. I started the program with an empty bar, and likely will need to use the 10 as the main plate.

Do I need to be really concerned about damaging these?",lb bumper plate used m year old female previously athletic pathetically shape overweight obese m starting greyskull lp pushing relatively fit husband just finished setting power rack home went black fringe sport bumper plate ton research didn t fancy urethane one did want protect floor accidental drop bumper plate rust potential picked lb set realized setup probably need lower weight plate point went review option s s s s saw note titan rep s supposed used heavier plate damage plate didn t say plate damaged intention dropping started program bar likely need use main plate need really concerned damaging

3500 kcal a day. My diet mostly consisted of the same stuff for the entire 6 months because I truly don't eat for enjoyment. I lift for a purpose (RIP Rich Piana) (and I guess because I'm way too lazy to cook, lol).

Location B - 155 lbs

So, I've recently learned the advantages of 'leaving one in the tank' and seen how it can positively impact my overall performance.

I've been pushing for max on all of my 4 sets. So for example, a typical day looks like:

8 Reps, 7 Reps, 6 Reps, 5 Reps

1086,Fitness,0,"How to measure HR zone/MET when your cardio improves? Hey, so standard recommendation for aerobic activity is: 150-300 mins of Moderate aerobic exercise or 75-150 of Vigorous, per weeek.
Moderate = 3-6 METs and Vigorous is &gt;6 METs.
Some activity examples listed cycling at 15 km/h as 5.8 METs. 
My question is once you adapt to current cardio workload, your conditioning will get better, and that activity now won't be equivalent to 5.8 METs (since it's easier for you to do it now right?), so it will be equivalent to less METs, and you won't get to that requires weekly dose. Maybe I'm wrong about this, maybe METs aren't dependant on conditioning, otherwise you'd need to do more and more activity just to reach required weekly dose of METs.
Same with HR, standard knowledge is that brisk walking puts you at 60-70% HR, but once you get more conditioned, it might not even put you at 60%.

As a little bit of athletic background, I spent most of my high school years swimming competitively and running track, wasn't amazing but did well at both. The last couple years I have been heavily focused on lifting weights, I am currently in pretty good shape from a power lifting perspective.  I have  begun training with the goal in mind of entering the Air Force Special Operations community and would like peoples opinions on the best method for transitioning my fitness into more of an endurance athlete. I was thinking a triathlon type program with some strength training and back off the cycling a little bit? I have never been an endurance athlete, so I realize this will be a somewhat difficult task. Even when I was swimming and running competitively it was all short distance high intensity events. Obviously it would be nice to keep a little bit of my strength but the main goal is to get myself to a point where I am able to run and swim at a consistent steady pace all day if needed. I plan on dedicating 6-12 months to this training.

I would also like some opinions on this SEAL prep program direct from the Navy site, it seems like it is a good mix of endurance work, conditioning, and strength [https://www.sealswcc.com/navy-seal-naval-special-warfare-physical-training-guide.html](https://www.sealswcc.com/navy-seal-naval-special-warfare-physical-training-guide.html).

Can your body be in an anabolic and catabolic state at the same time? Is anabolic fasting scientifically proven to work or just another marketing scheme? I'd appreciate any references and studies as well.

My work consists of 12+ hours everyday meaning other then one meal I pack all my food. There’s no gym as it’s in rural Australia. I am looking a little pudgy as a couple weeks before leaving I stopped the gym and started eating pretty rough. Now seems like a ideal time to cut as I don’t have a gym or a lot of food on hand, and not really a lot of time. 

I’m roughly 5’11 170lbs with a smaller build. My plan is to eat at a 500 calorie deficit while doing body exercises before or after work. I could run but don’t have a lot of room plus scary snakes. Work consists of sitting so I won’t be burning much. I don’t want to lose a lot of muscle as I don’t have much to start with, my weight routine was interrupted by injury and kinesiologist trying to fix my knee issues. But I’m self conscious enough to want to lose some belly fat (last place for my body) and even some face fat before travelling and a bit of partying. 

I have about 2 months and am thinking I could lose about 5-10lbs before looking too skinny. Ideally I would bulk for another 6-12 months but currently that isn’t an option! Hoping to get some good tips!

1117,Fitness,0,"GZCL programming for Crossft/Oly Lifts? My primary form of exercise is crossfit, so I was wondering if anyone here had advice on programming GZCL to sub in some Olympic lift training in place of benching.

I train 4x per week at a crossfit gym, doing the class then staying after for supplemental strength training (sicne the dedicated str training in crossfit can be few and far between depending on the programming block). As such I cannot do any moves that involve isolation machines, as they simply aren't available. Other than the 4 day split and need to center around barbell/dumbell and bodyweight movements, I really don't have any restrictions, so open to any advice.

Also I am not a games athlete or looking to do anything like that, just someone who enjoys resistance training and the oly lifts, so wanting to maximize carry over potential for the work I put in.

I am running 5/3/1 currently during a cut, but would like to switch it up once I start lean bulking, and GZCL seems like a natural evolution from 5/3/1. There are basically no horizontal pressing movements in Crossfit, so as a ""sport application"", bench and its variants do nothing for me. I'd much rather tailor towards squatting, deadlift, ohp, and oly moves. The GZCL blog on application and adaptation encouraged tailoring the programming to your needs, but I didn't see any existing templates that had Olympic lifts integrated.

Was thinking something along the lines of:

* M T1 - Back Squat / Tu T1 - Snatch / Tr T1 - Deadlift - F T1 - Clean and Jerk.
* T2 - Lots of OHP and Front Squats, Deadlift assistance, Barbell hip thruts.
* T3 - Dips, pullups, lunges, etc.

Thoughts?

1123,Fitness,0,"What type of fitness equipment could I realistically fit into my small bedroom? **TL;DR: What type of home fitness equipment could I realistically fit into my small bedroom to improve my overall fitness and strength? Diagram of my room: https://i.imgur.com/FrD0G4I.png**

I REALLY want to start a thorough home exercise regime. I've been losing weight for the past year and going to the gym regularly but it's becoming increasingly difficult to actually make it to the gym with anxiety issues, losing my car and taking on a new job. I want to purchase some home exercise equipment to continue my routine and invest further in my health and fitness but I'm unsure what I could realistically get given the tiny amount of space I have available to me.

My room is roughly 335cm (W) by 268cm (H) and I have the following pieces of furniture:

* Bed - 190cm (W) by 125cm (H)
* Drawer - 80cm (W) by 50cm (H)
* Cupboard - 55cm (W) by 80cm (H)
* Table - 120cm (W) by 60cm (H)
* **Rough diagram of my room layout illustrating: https://i.imgur.com/FrD0G4I.png**

This leaves me with roughly 245cm (W) by 135cm (H) of open floor space plus a little bit extra around some of the furniture. My budget for this is probably in the couple to few hundred pound range, I'm willing to spend a bit to get what I need to get started but I am on a budget. Also the diagram above is pretty rough but I try to pad everything so I'm not over estimating the free space available.

In terms of my fitness goals, I want to improve my general fitness and get more muscular. So I want to increase my endurance, flexibilty, strength, you name it. Right now I can't do a single pushup or pull up so being able to do things like that would be great. I also can't bench more than like 10kg.

1127,Fitness,0,"Thoughts/experiences adding “accessory” compound lifts for higher volume work during a cut? I’m about to begin my first cut after my first bulk. I know everyone says you should stick to the same program when going from a bulk to a cut, but I was running a modified ivysaur 448 with a lot of added accessory volume because I was just trying to get as meaty and strong as possible. I have progressed nicely over the last 5 months (on the higher end of beginner at my current weight) but now I feel like I’m just getting too fat. I’m 6ft even and 215lbs, and I think I’d ideally like to see what I look like 6 months from now at 185lbs. 

I want to cut and focus on the big compound lifts, lowering volume and rep ranges and focusing on lifting as heavy as I can. Do you think it could be beneficial to alternate the major standard lifts with some of their variants? For instance, alternating flat bench 3x4 on one day with an incline bench 3x8, and doing something similar with back squat/front squat, and conventional deadlift/Romanian deadlift? Or, should I stick to the major compound lifts and take advantage of the principles of specialization?

My thinking is that I can allow myself to up the volume a bit on the variants since they naturally won’t be able to bear as much weight, but still push the primary muscle groups hard and in as many ways as possible to stimulate as much protein synthesis as I can and signal to my body to hold on to as much muscle as possible. It also  just seems like it will be more fun to have a little bit of variety in my full body routine over the course of the next 5 or 6 months that I spend trying to trim the fat.

1129,Fitness,0,"Explosiveness, weight, and sets For explosiveness (or rate of force production) training, I've come across quite different recommendations for training with weights/under load. One group recommends a few sets of relatively few reps at high weight. The other group recommends relatively lower weights with more reps. Both groups recommend completing reps as fast as possible and supplementing the weight training with plyometrics and sprinting. 

For example, a high weight routine might be something like 5x3 with each rep done at a minimum of 80% of 1RM. A lower weight routine might be done at 3x8 with weights ranging from 60-80% of 1RM.

1133,Fitness,0,"M/22/5'5"" 110lbs to 132lbs in 2 years progress [http://imgur.com/a/HTeApPy](http://imgur.com/a/HTeApPy)

Started out at 100lbs but I was lifting for 3months on ICF 5x5 In the before picture. From then till now I use the reddit PPL with some additional volume and modifications. I dirty bulked till 125-130lbs and have been doing many mini bulk and cuts and recomps(plateauing super hard basically for like a year).

I eat 2700cals to bulk and track my protein to make sure I get 130-150g a day and then it's anything really.

I'm really trying to take this more seriously so I'm going to be training and eating a lot more rigorously now to take my physique to the next level.

Routine:

**Push: Bench press or Incline bench press 5x5**

**Flat dumbbell bench press or incline dumbbell press 3x8-12**

**Decline dumbbell press 3x8-12**

**Overhead press 3x5**

**Dumbbell shoulder press 3x8-12**

**Single arm cable triceps pulldown 3x8-12**

**Overhead dumbbell triceps extension 3x8-12**

**Lateral raises 6x15-20**

**Pull: Deadlifts or rack pulls 3x5**

**Barbell rows 3x5**

**Weighted pullups 3x8-12**

**Cable seated row or seated high row machine 3x8-12**

**Face pulls 5x15-20**

**Barbell Curls 4x8-12**

**Hammer Curls 4x8-12**

**Straight arm pulldowns 3x8-12**

**Legs: Barbell Squats 5x5**

**Hamstring leg curl 3x8-12**

**Leg press 3x8-12**

**Hip abductor machine 3x8-12**

**Weighted lunges 3x8-12**

**Hyperextensions 2x15**

**Calf raises 5x15-20**

If I can hit the upper limit of the rep range through all my sets with good form, I increase the weight. Usually 5lbs for bench press and overhead press and 10lbs for squats and deadlifts. Accessories I just jump to the next stack on a machine or the next set of dumbbells. I chose the PPL routine because I was getting bored with stronglifts and wanted something more hypertrophy focused so I looked around and found the reddit PPL. I tried it out and fell in love with it. Throughout my time I've adjusted stuff based on what works for me and added more volume as the standard template was not providing me enough stimulus and I was cruising through those workouts.

**Diet:**

Breakfast: 4 eggs with spinach, peppers, mushroom, onion omelette style and 60g oats with 1/2 cup assorted berries - 400ish cals

Snack: Banana and protein shake - 200 cals

Lunch: 2 naan with whatever my mom cooked, usually veggies or stew or lentils and a protein shake - 600cals

Dinner: same as above - 600cals

Dinner #2: same as above - 600cals

Before bed meal: 125g icelandic greek yogurt, 2tbspn peanut butter, banana, and 2 caramel choc chip rice cakes - 400 cals

Total is around 2800cals, \~150g of protein

I only track calories and protein but I usually eat a lot of carbs in my diet because I found that they digest quickly for me allowing me to reach my calorie goals. I also function better with carbs as my performance in the gym goes up and I look fuller.

Lift numbers are 5x5 as I don't do 1rm.

Overhead Press: 85lbsx5

Bench: 175lbsx5

Squat: 185lbsx5

Deadlift: 275lbsx5

Going forward I'm going to stick with the PPL program and I believe I can still progress linearly for a little while as long as I'm eating correctly. As soon as I can't progress linearly I'm going to switch to 5/3/1 progression for main lifts. For my diet I'm going to stick with a lean bulk at 2700-2800 cals and slowly increase the calories as my weight increases to make sure I'm still able to build muscle and increase strength.",m lb lb year progress imgur hteappy imgur hteappy started lb lifting month icf x picture till use ppl additional volume modification dirty bulked till lb doing mini bulk cut recomps plateauing super hard basically like year eat cals bulk track protein make sure g day s really m really trying seriously m going training eating lot rigorously physique level routine push bench press incline bench press x flat dumbbell bench press incline dumbbell press x decline dumbbell press x overhead press x dumbbell shoulder press x single arm cable triceps pulldown x overhead dumbbell triceps extension x lateral raise x pull deadlifts rack pull x barbell row x weighted pullups x cable seated row seated high row machine x face pull x barbell curl x hammer curl x straight arm pulldowns x leg barbell squat x hamstring leg curl x leg press x hip abductor machine x weighted lunge x hyperextension x calf raise x hit upper limit rep range set good form increase weight usually lb bench press overhead press lb squat deadlifts accessory just jump stack machine set dumbbell chose ppl routine getting bored stronglifts wanted hypertrophy focused looked ppl tried fell love time adjusted stuff based work added volume standard template providing stimulus cruising workout diet breakfast egg spinach pepper mushroom onion omelette style g oat cup assorted berry ish cals snack banana protein shake cals lunch naan mom cooked usually veggie stew lentil protein shake cals dinner cals dinner cals bed meal g icelandic greek yogurt tbspn peanut butter banana caramel choc chip rice cake cals total cals \ g protein track calorie protein usually eat lot carbs diet digest quickly allowing reach calorie goal function better carbs performance gym go look fuller lift number x don t rm overhead press lbsx bench lbsx squat lbsx deadlift lbsx going forward m going stick ppl program believe progress linearly little long m eating correctly soon t progress linearly m going switch progression main lift diet m going stick lean bulk cals slowly increase calorie weight increase make sure m able build muscle increase strength

1139,Fitness,0,"How I lost 150lbs and built muscle in 3.5 years as a teenager Stats : 6'1 / 230lbs / 19 years old

Before and after photos : [https://imgur.com/a/JRm2pXN](https://imgur.com/a/JRm2pXN)

My stomach is tucked in my underwear in the image above, here's an image with it not tucked so everyone can see : [https://imgur.com/XHTAG0C](https://imgur.com/XHTAG0C)

Note\* : I have had gastric bypass done at the age of 15 that helped me get down to 250lbs, seeing how I had stopped losing weight and did not like my physique, I began eating properly and hitting the gym. I also had my gyno and some loose skin removed from my chest in February 2019. Had gyno ever since I was 13. No steroids were used in the making.

Diet :

Since my stomach had expanded to a point where I could eat like how I used to, I had one goal in mind, to get as jacked as possible. Started to use a calorie calculator, and tracked what I ate. I had a healthy diet which is high in protein, carbs and low in fats accompanied with veggies. Whichever calculator you use, it will give you a close estimate to how much you need to eat in order to gain or lose weight, the rest is trial and error until you figure out what works for you. Everyone's metabolism is different. All meals included either chicken,beef,fish and eggs accompanied with rice,pasta,bread or any other carb source I had. Also a lot of low sugar ketchup because It makes it go down easy. You can do it however you like, I am more comfortable restricting myself rather than doing IIFYM (if it fits your macros) or any other diet.

Workouts :

Most people don't do enough sets and reps. You need to take the muscle to a point of failure to cause it to grow. If the goal was to do 12 reps for that set, you shouldn't be able to do 13-14 reps (with proper form). That means the muscle has failed and you cannot perform the movement. I include drop sets and half reps when I hit that point. I drop the weight by 20-25% for dropsets. Lets say you do 100lbs for the lat pull down, once you finish your first set, you drop down to 80lbs and do reps till failure. Below Is the exact workout routine I have had since becoming knowledgeable on effective training, I have not stopped getting stronger or bigger. I have a larger structure than most and require more sets/reps than other people, your needs might vary. It is a Pull , Push, Legs program that has a strength block and hypertrophy block. My goal was to get bigger and also stronger. Times where I wouldn't get stronger, I would change the rep ranges for the Squat, Bench and Deadlift such as doing sets of 8 or 10 at the same intensity. It is also important to back off the weight and de load every once in a while when you plateau.

I train 6 times a week, either doing PPL/Rest/PPL or PPL/PPL/Rest. I'm always ready to go resting 2 days per body part.

Here is what I did :

Day 1: Back and Biceps

1x5 Deadlifts @ RPE 9, warm up to your 5-rep max and perform the sets and reps listed. Then lower the weight to an RPE of 8 and do it for 5 reps.

3x8-12 Lat pull downs, you can use different hand grip variations and do 2 drop sets/set of 10-12.

3x8-12 Seated cable rows, you can use different hand grip variations and do 2 drop sets/set of 10-12.

3x10-12 Pull ups, either assisted, bodyweight or added weight.

3x10-12 Cable pull overs, use the rope.

2x10-12 Bicep curls, with 2 drop sets/set until failure, you can use any variation.

2x10-12 Hammer bicep curls, with 2 drop sets/set until failure.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 2: Chest, Shoulders and Triceps

5x5 Bench Press @ RPE 9, warm up to your 5-rep max and perform the sets and reps listed. Then lower the weight to an RPE of 8 and do it for 5 reps.

3x8-10 Shoulder press, it can be performed by dumbbell, barbell or machine.

3x8-10 Incline dumbbell press, with 2 drop sets/set.

3x10-12 Dumbbell lateral raises, with 2 drop sets/set.

3x10-12 Pec fly’s, with 2 drop sets/set.

3x10-12 Front delt raises, with 2 drop sets/set.

4x10-12 Tricep pushdowns, with 2 drop sets/set.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 3: Leg Day

5x5 Squats @ RPE 9, warm up to your 5-rep max and perform the sets and reps listed.Then lower the weight to an RPE of 8 and do it for 5 reps.

3x8-10 Romanian dead-lifts, dumbbell or barbell.

3x10-12 Leg extensions, with 2 drop sets/set.

3x10-12 Hamstring curls, you can do them on machines either lying down or sitting, with 2 drop sets.

3x10-12 Leg press, with 2 drop sets/set.

3x10-12 Calf raises, I recommend doing them on the leg press.

Tips :

Be consistent, that is the number one rule you should follow. Don't eat good day 1 and then start eating junk by day 3.

Train with proper form and enough volume.

Sleep well.

IT TAKES TIME AND EFFORT, you're not going to magically gain a bunch of muscle overnight and lose fat.

The more you dedicate to it, the more the results.

Stretching has helped so much with my performance, spend around 10-15 minutes of this before every workout.

Do not compare yourself to other, your progress is individualistic. My buddy who I started lifting with could cry himself every day because he doesn't have as much muscle as I do, but instead he focuses on becoming the best he can be.

1145,Fitness,0,"Program Review-Layne Norton's PH3 *Disclaimer:* I originally wrote/posted this for /r/weightroom, so considering the slightly different average user base here I wanted to add something. Most every program in the wiki/commonly discussed here is a good choice for almost anyone familiar with the basic barbell movements. This program is not a good choice for a beginner or 'early intermediate'. Layne has a blanket suggestion of having at least a 350 wilks score on squat/bench/dead before starting the program. While the specific strength you have isn't necessarily relevant, you absolutely must have a substantial base in terms of work capacity and technical proficiency in the lifts, particularly consistency under fatigue. You WILL do a lot of hard sets back to back to back to back and keep doing so for the entirety of the 12 weeks. As written, burnout and some minor injuries while running this program aren't that unlikely, and that risk is only going to be magnified if you lack sufficient skill and conditioning. So with that out of the way: 

Before going into this [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ckQfaMim4G-it8JZyb3D1MQqfP34ydzCR9K1th-QMwg/edit#gid=1003723868) is the spreadsheet I used. I think there is more information available but I went in with nothing but this sheet and the knowledge the its supposed to be run with a real 1RM, not a TM.

Results:

I don't believe that strength is a set thing that can be easily measured, so I never really like to say ""I got stronger"", particularly only after 12 weeks. How much you lift on any given day is influenced by so much more than how 'strong' you are. That said, I did set multiple PRs while running the program, and regularly tied old best sets.

Biggest PRs:

615x10 Deadlift (~40lb PR on best e1RM, ~60lbs on best actual 1RM)

405x12 Squat (~40lb PR on best e1RM and actual 1RM).

Some PR for bench that I don't remember, wasnt as significant (~10-15lb e1RM over best 1RM)

No other lift is really focused on in the program.

I can't say how much of this progress was actually strength gained from the program and how much was expression of strength due to a lot of practice at SBD with heavy loads from this program, and slightly reduced work load (for the first half of the program).

Size wise I won't really speculate. I am at a point were I don't think any program would make much of a change in onlt 12 weeks. I am happy with a small improvement over the course of a year.

Training History/Stats:

I'll be brief. I've been training ~6 years. Currently 6'5''/265 at tail end of bulk, probably 260ish at start of program. PRs going in being 520/365/765 SBD. I used slightly reduced 1RMs to plug into the program as I don't know if I would have been able to actually hit those numbers right at the start, having just come off Deep Water inspired training which definitely had me primed for higher rep lower weight instead of the opposite.

Program Description and General Thoughts:

PH3 is a 5 day/week program heavily focused on SBD. You will squat 3x a week, bench 3x a week and Deadlift 2x a week. There is a SBD day, a pure upper hypertrophy day, A SB day, a BD day and a S day. Two of those days also prescribe lower body hypertrophy work and another one prescribes upper body hypertrophy. You will do a lot of sets of each with moderate to, frankly, insane weights. If you run it exactly as written you will probably burn out or get injured (or maybe I am just a little bitch). BUT, I had a lot of fun with it, thought it was very beneficial and will run it again at some point with modifications. Ill go into what I think about how to modify it after this. I really enjoyed SBDing that much and using higher weights than I usually do. Up until the end there were a lot of days I thought there was no way I could do that but ended up finishing without too much trouble.

The program is split into 3 1 month phases, Ill briefly go over each and my thoughts.

Phase 1; Accumulation:

This phase is fine as written. It isn't too bad, and eases you into the high frequency heavy work in a reasonable manner. I have been doing 6x a week for years now so getting that extra rest day was weird at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly. I was pretty burned out at my 6x week Deep Water experiment (you probably should not do that) so it ended up being welcome. I bought a concept2 rower to use on off days. Each week follows the same layout, minus the 4th which sets you up for some test sets. Each subsequent week will make each workout a bit harder, adding a set, or weight to the sets. Weeks 2/3 have an AMRAP set for each lift. I think you can feel free to push these in this phase, but you might want to misrepresent them in the spreadsheet (see the modifications section).

Phase 2; Transition:

This phase is pretty much the same as the first, only harder. I would say that is stage is, as written, doable but challenging in of itself, but might need some toning down if you want to be able to take on the third phase close to as written. I think there were a couple days I cut a few squat sets, and one day I cut some bench sets. I started getting some lingering issues in my knee during this phase but nothing really unmanageable. I completely skipped one SB day because I went out the night before and it was probably for the best that I did so. I had some PRs in this phase still.

Phase 3; Intensity/Overreaching phase Go fuck yourself:

Here is where it kind of fell apart, at least for me. I am willing to acknowledge that maybe I was just not up to snuff for this program, and that it was a personal failing, not a failing on the programs side, but I don't really think so (that or I missed some nuances in the background material). It, like the last two programs, keeps the theme of ramping up sets, weight and the odd rep number, over 4 weeks. Unlike the previous 2, it starts at a challenging level, and ramps into insane levels. I powered through the first 2, easiest weeks, not cutting much, still dealing with my knee which was manageable with warm up and conscientious squat technique. Beginning of week three I did something to my shoulder that lead to it being numb and painful at shoulder/elbow when squatting or benching. This was also week of Christmas so I cut 1 or 2 days and for the rest just tried to hit the same body parts to whatever degree I could, just stopping when my arm acted up too much. Week 4, instead of tapering down for PR sets like in the first two phases, keeps ramping up and culminates with the instructions to do a day in which you Deadlift 5x2 + AMRAP set with 95.5% and Bench 5x3 + AMRAP at 95.5% one day, then Squat 5x3 + AMRAP at 95.5% the second. This are percentages of numbers that have crept very close to my true 1RMS. And done after 11 weeks of punishing training. I completely gave up on even attempting it as written and split each exercise into seperate days, and toned it down a bit. Deads were reduced by 25lbs but completed as written, bench was reduced to 2 reps with the prescribed weight and barely completed, with no additional reps on the AMRAP. Ill have to see how squats feel on Friday to decide how I will handle it. Basically TL;DR of this phase is it's bullshit. Maybe it would have been less bullshit if I didnt tweakmy shoulder.

Modifications:

As I said a few times earlier, I think you need to de-fang this program a little bit going into it. Or just man the fuck up more than I did. Here are a couple options I have considered after going through it.

Lower you 1RM: One obvious option is to lower the number you enter into the sheet to lower the intensity of the entire program. This is probably my least favorite suggestion. Maybe it is due to my history of 531 and 531 inspired training but NOT using really sub-maximal weight for most of your sets is a refreshing part of this program, and a GOOD part of the challenge. I think you can go in with a REALISTIC 1RM (not what you did that one time on a good day when the stars aligned and Buddha was spotting your spirit, what you could reasonably hope to put up for a single most days if you tried really hard). A sub-suggestion and better idea is to slightly under-represent your AMRAPs, or just hold them back when you do them (but where is the fun in that).

Cutting sets: A better option I think is to cut down on the sets prescribed. As mentioned above, phase one is probably fine. Phase 2 doesn't need much. But phase 3 could definitely do with some pruning. I think the best way to do this would be to not ramp up the sets on the non-AMRAP days. So day 1 (SBD) and day 3 (SB), keep the workout as listed for the first week. Maybe limit phase 2 at the second weeks workouts.

Just Trust Yourself: If you have the training experience and confidence to actually determine how your body is doing (and you should have at least a lot of experience before doing this program, even if some people never really like to trust there subjective observations) you can just take each day as a suggestion/challenge, and cut yourself off when appropriate. The issue with this is there will probably be some days where you can push through to the end, but you will be shooting yourself in the foot for future days. But if you have an idea of what fatigue feels like and can estimate where you will be next week depending on how you feel this week, it could work well.

Closing Thoughts:

I like this program. I think its bullshit at the end. It injured me a bit (not the first program to do that though). It has mostly wiped me out. But I like it and would recommend it. It does need to be pared down a little, but has a lot of potential.

Also before I get asked in the comments, I just did some stuff for the hypertrophy work. It doesn't matter, it's fucking accessory work. Just do some sets of things you like until you get tired. Don't neglect your back work. Same advice as you can give about picking the accessories for anything. The barbell work is the main dish, stop worrying about the side salad (which is probably made with shitty iceberg lettuce anyways).

EDIT:
Well as I said I might, I ended up making some changes to PH3:

[PHw33ni3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tCi26oYp8GvT7bJuoTGDvbqy8mazemFxD02Nl4xaFRQ/edit?usp=sharing)

I tried to keep it as close and true to the original as I could, just shaved down to what I think is reasonably completable. I left several areas open to user discretion so one can push themselves if they are on a roll, but I want to emphasize that for most of those options its not a matter of saying ""Yeah, really push for all those sets"" it's just leaving the option if you truly found the base number easy, think Joker sets. I ended up preserving the last week as best I could. I think it SHOULD be a challange and it's not like there is anything after it you gotta save energy for. I did file down it's teeth a little bit though. 

I included a changelog that I think has every change I made so you can see what is different.

He claims that of course you can gain strength without building muscle and he gives multiple examples of powerlifters/weightlifters who arent nearly as muscular as their counterparts in the same weight categories in bodybuilding. E.g. there are 60kg ppl who can lift insane amounts and yet if you saw them outside you wouldnt even be sure that they are going to the gym.

1151,Fitness,0,"Deadlifting, Preventing Injury and Noise when returning to the floor Hey everyone,

Had kind of a weird experience today. I've been going to the gym pretty regularly for the past 6 months to get myself back into shape and one exercise that I always kind of avoided was deadlifting. Back when I played football in high school, I hurt my lower back due to bad form on my deadlifts and I've kind of avoided it ever since. But it turned to the point that my deadlift max was lower than my squat max. So since November or so I've began working on my deadlift, especially heavy deadlifts, and finally started getting a feel for the proper form and now deadlift more than my squat like most people do.

But as you know, heavy deadlifts can be loud by nature when returning to the floor from the top. I always come down with the bar and I never just drop it (I lower the bar similarly to this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o4N4935tMk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o4N4935tMk) ). However, as I have been increasing weight, it's natural for the sound to be a bit loud when hitting the floor. I've never had issues though except today. Granted the gym was empty today except for one other person and the employee at the desk overseeing the gym. But this person got off their exercise bike and walked all the way over to the gym desk to complain about what I was doing. The employee came by and told me to stop dropping the weights. I wasn't, but I just nodded my head since I didn't want to start a fuss or anything. It's the first time I've ever had a gym employee come by to tell me something so I was also caught off-guard. I've never had an issue before when I dead-lifted the same way and the employee didn't seem to mind at all until the other woman came by to complain. I then basically lifted the same way, but tried to kind of baby the weight down more instead of lowering it like the video. But this caused twinges in my lower back. I ended up just stopping deadlifts for the day since I didn't want more complaints directed at me or to get kicked out.

So my question to fellow fitness goers is how do you guys lower the bar for heavy deadlifts quietly, but prevent back injury? Should I just cut the weight down so I can fully control it down?

Or should I treat this like a one off event and keep doing what I usually do?

Thanks! :)

Note: This is also a university gym if it matters and unfortunately, I don't have the funds to pay for a gym membership at a different gym.

UPDATE: Holy crap this blew up while I was asleep.  The gym does not have a deadlift platform or bumper plates unfortunately.

UPDATE 2: I really appreciate the advice and replies throughout. It was cool to see that a lot of people are okay with some noise and go to gyms where it isn't an issue. I hope to find a gym like this in the future. It was funny to read even if some of them seemed certain to get me kicked out. Also nice to see suggestions like the eccentrics, mats, etc. I will definitely try those out and see what works best for me. I also may send an email to the Rec people at the university to see if bumper plates and/or a platform might be things they could look at getting. Honestly, I got a little discouraged about deadlifting because of what happened with the lady complaining and my back injury in high school. Bad things always seem to happen when I start deadlifting.

1153,Fitness,0,"Metabolism and Muscle Mass question Hi All,   


I wonder if anybody would weigh on this. I am reading the book ""You Are Your Own Gym"" about calisthenics and fellow writes the following:  
""The reason many people gain weight as they age, especially beginning in their 30s, is because they have less muscle than they had in their late teens and early twenties. As we age, our bodies naturally lose muscle, especially as we are less active in our lives. This muscle tissue loss results in a decreasing metabolic rate. And then, if you continue to eat like you did when you were younger… well, you’ll slowly gain weight, pound by pound, month by month, year by year, until one day you look in the mirror and wonder, “What happened?” The key to eliminating accumulated body fat is regaining your youthful metabolism by regaining your muscle.

Muscle is the most metabolically expensive tissue we have: It takes between 50 and 100 calories a day just to keep one pound of muscle alive, for both men and women, even if you are completely inactive. An extra five pounds of muscle can burn up to 15,000 calories in a month—that’s the equivalent of two pounds of fat. Muscle is the single greatest tool for weight loss. Increased muscle mass let’s you lose weight with less attention paid to calorie  
counting and food selection.

But with consistent aerobic exercise, over time, you’re far more likely to burn five pounds of muscle. That means your body will burn at least 250 less calories a day. And as your body becomes more efficient at running, that 195 calories you burn on the treadmill will decrease to about 125. So let’s do the math: You burn 125 calories above your resting metabolic rate each day you do aerobic exercise. Then add the minimum 250 calories you do not burn due to muscle loss caused by this exercise. After all your huffing and puffing you are now 125 calories in the wrong direction!""

1156,Fitness,0,"Getting more explosive with hamstring/knee flexion and hanging leg raises: can I go really heavy with hamstring curls without a huge risk? I’d like to develop more “explosiveness” for movements that involve bringing my ankles to my butt and bringing my knees to my chest.

My understanding of improving explosiveness is to do high weight/low reps and focus alot on doing the movement with, well, explosiveness. (I’ve heard this is what track athletes do with the squat - they don’t care much about ATG). But are exercises (1) and (2) okay for really heavy weight/2-4 rep range?

1163,Fitness,0,"20/M/6'5"": 122.6 lbs lost in 2019 **Photos:**

[Before and After](https://imgur.com/a/eo9180J)

[Body](https://imgur.com/a/Wp4GNc0)

[Face](https://imgur.com/a/101fuH6)

**Weight:**

~350 lbs -&gt; 227.4lbs

**Diet:**

Diet was pretty much just portion control. Eating a lot of the things I still liked at first but at a lower amount than before. I tried my hardest to keep around 1500 calories a day. Pretty much what I did was I found a TDEE calculator, and cut my basal metabolic rate in half and ate that much. My diet was pretty much exclusively Chicken breast, microwave mixed vegetables, peanut butter sandwiches, apples, and protein shakes. 
I am still pretty bad when it comes to eating healthy, making it a bit harder to lose the last 15-20 lbs I want to lose, but I'm getting better at it every day.

**Lifting Program:**

In the beginning I stuck to the pretty simple Push, Pull, Legs program. Tried to do my best by doing 5x5 on compound lifts, and just 4x10 on everything else. After a while I started to modify my lifting program, and started doing Chest/Triceps, Back/Biceps, Chest/Shoulders, Legs. I also moved to higher volume, lower weight on back and bicep day (especially biceps), and vice versa on Chest day. Here is my current Program

**Chest/Tricep:**

5x5: 

Bench

Incline Bench

4x8:

Incline Dumbbell Bench

Chest Press

Fly Machine 

Tricep Pushdown
 
Tricep Pulldown
 
Skull Crushers 

Squeeze Press

One Arm Tricep Pulldowns

**Back/Bicep:**

4x10: 

Bent Over Rows

Barbell Shrugs

3x15:

Dumbbell Hammer Curl

Preacher Curl

Barbell Curl

Incline Dumbbell Curls

Dumbbell Row

Cable Pulldown

Cable Row

Assisted Pull up

**Chest/Shoulders:**

5x5: 

Bench

OHP (usually try and pyramid up to a max for OHP, helps with my shoulder development)

4x10:

Incline Dumbbell Bench

Chest Press

Fly Machine 

Lateral Raises

Arnold Press

Reverse Dumbbell Fly

Reverse Fly Machine

Face Pull

Lateral Cable Raises 

**Leg:**

5x5:

Squat 

Deadlift (Conventional or Sumo, depends on how im feeling)

4x10:

Hamstring curls

Leg Extension (low weight usually)

Abduction Machine

Adduction Machine

Leg Press

Calf Raises

**Core:**

Usually throw in 2 quick core exercises at the end of each day

**Cardio:**

I Bike everywhere at school (in College currently), but I also occasionally do Boxing, Jumprope, and Running. 

**Lift Progression:**

Bench: 115 -&gt; 195 (1 Rep Max)

Overhead Press: 65 -&gt; 115 (1 Rep Max)

Deadlift: 225 -&gt; 335 (1 Rep Max)

Squat: 135 -&gt; 225 (5x5)

**How I got Fat:** 

My family has always been fairly unhealthy. While I was encouraged to do sports when I was younger, it fell off pretty hard when I got into middle/highschool. From 7th to 8th grade I gained around 60 lbs, and when I was a freshman in highschool I weighed 300lbs. I ended up doing some weightlifting in Highschool for a Physical Education credit, but ended up stopping half way through. I spent most of my days just playing video games, and eating all I wanted. This eventually lead to me weighing about 350 lbs during my Highschool Graduation. My Graduation Gown was so tight on me I couldn’t even sit down with it zipped up. When I got to college, my eating habits continued. While I was more active walking around campus, I had an all you can eat meal plan, and boy did I use it. Between eating large pizzas at least 3 times a week, eating full tubs of Ben and Jerry's ice cream daily, and nightly Subway runs, I maintained my weight of 350 lbs throughout my first year of college. 

**How I got Fit:**

While I had done some moderate lifting earlier on in 2019, it wasn't until after my 20th Birthday, that I decided to go all in. I was sick of being fat, and I finally accepted how much I hated my body. In early April I decided to start my diet and exercise routine and finally take it seriously. With the semester ended, I had a ridiculous amount of time to exercise, and I took advantage of my Universities gyms. Just trying to wake up every day and go was a bit of a hassle at first, but I stuck with it. Slowly I began to see a difference on the scale, where I would drop around 10 lbs a week for my first month. While this amount of weight loss does sound massively unhealthy, I think it was mostly a product of the amount I was eating before. Before dieting I was most likely eating upwards of 5000 Calories a day, and cutting it down to 1500 was hard, but made me drop weight like crazy. By the end of the summer, after about 4 months of Dieting and Exercise, I was finally down to about 260lbs. As school started up again, I ended up seeing most of my friends who freaked out when seeing the fact that I dropped 80-90lbs over summer. After that I continued my diet/exercise, and eventually dropped down to where I am at now, 227.4 lbs. While during the Fall semester I did cheat on my meals a lot, drank a good amount, and overall didn't stick to my diet, I was really happy I remained active and didn’t bounce back with my weight.
 
**Future goals:**

My Goal Weight is 205, and I want to hit that preferably in the first quarter of 2020. A big one is also benching 225 for the first time, which hopefully will happen very soon. As for this year, I hope to be able to increase all my compound lifts by 100 lbs (I know its a lofty goal, but aim high hit low) by the end of 2020.

**Improvements Outside of the Gym:**

As for outside of the gym, my life has changed pretty drastically. All the posts on reddit saying that people treat you differently when you are a more natural weight is true. People treat me better, and it has made me so much more comfortable in my own skin. I feel like i'm much more outgoing now, and it has improved my happiness quite a bit. I even ended up dating the girl i've had a huge crush on for the past year and a half, which is pretty crazy in its own right. 

It's never too late to start losing weight. I thought I was fucked because of how heavy I was, and that I’d never be able to commit. I finally did, and it was the greatest decision of my life. If you are viewing this on New Years for encouragement, please go through with it. It will be the best thing you’ve ever done for yourself.

1170,Fitness,0,"Question regarding PHUL I am currently changing my program. I did 5/3/1 BBB for some time and got great results, but I need some change in my routine and the idea of splitting up the volume of each compound into two separate days appeals to me. Naturally, being on this sub often, I came across PHUL and got a lot of inspiration from it. 
My question is: What is the benefit of doing two power and two hypertrophy days? I understand that a mix of low volume and high volume is desirable, but for instance: on the lower body power day, I would do low-volume/powerlifting sets for both squats and deadlifts and naturally be weaker for whatever compound exercise I do second (which hurts my ego). 

I am currently thinking of mixing it up by doing low volume sets for each compound (bench, dl, ohp, squat) on different days (e.g. bench on upper body day 1, ohp on upper body day 2 etc.) and hypertrophy sets respectively on the other day (so e.g. Bench low-volume sets on UB day 1 and hypertrophy chest sets on UB day 2).

I’ve heard kettle bells is a good option due to the muscles used to support and stabilize the weight being engaged more. Is this factual? 
  I’m just trying to train for health/functionality purposes so size isn’t my main concern. Does anyone have any experience with this stuff? Is it worth adding to my routine? How often should I train? How many exercises should I add and what exercises target what muscle groups? Thank you!

I've heard a few different opinions on how to incorporate the Olympic lifts into training for other sports (rowing/cycling in my case). I was curious if anyone could shed some light on the best way to balance the relative technical difficulty of the lifts with their benefits in power development. 
I've heard a few different approaches such as doing high pulls to avoid some of the technical challenges or doing snatches instead of cleans as they can be easier to load eventually.

I'm not expecting a perfect answer, just wondering what people know or have heard about.

I'm currently at 168.2 kg (\~371 pounds) down from 241.5kg (532 pounds) and have no started going to the gym to improve and speed up my weight loss, and just be more healthy in general. I have a few general questions though:

1) I've been aiming for doing \~ 7 - 12 reps and 3 sets for each weight lifting exercise. The problem is, the reps can drop a lot with each set. Eg: I can do 12 reps of chest flyes for the first two sets, but only 8 for the last one. For the last set, should I just continue with a lower weight, or accept the 8 for the last set? This has been a bigger concern when the reps start to fall out of the 7 - 12 range, say for example I start off doing 7 reps, but then only do 5 after. What's the protocol here?

2) Should I bother with reps that I can't complete? Like for example, when doing bicep curls, sometimes I can get an extra one or two on my left arm if I kind of swing my back a little to get some momentum. Should I do this to complete my reps for each set if needed, or is it useless?

3) I'm currently losing weight from 1 - 2 kg a week. I've heard at this rate, it's hard to build muscle as I'd be losing so much of it. If there is truth to that, what can be done for it?

1180,Fitness,0,"My adductors are always sore Hey there everyone.

 I'm currently dealing with an issue with my adductors where they are always sore and feel tight. My main sport is running (not elite, but definitely above average), and I do relatively high mileage (around 100+km per week), with 2 strength sessions per week.

What happens is that during a run usually around the 30min mark, my adductors will start to feel really tight and after running, they will be extremely sore to the point where if I try to close my legs together it will be very painful. Stretching and foam rolling only offers temporary relief. I also feel a lot of soreness when I wake up, to the point where I have no motivation to do anything. I've tried just resting for 2 full weeks (just doing the strength work), but it didn't improve at all.

One theory that I have, is that maybe my adductors are really weak and they get tight so they don't get injured (?).  I've started some adductor specific exercises at home, but since it's been only a few days I don't have any progress so far, and I was wondering if someone here could confirm my theory or offer some advice.

Also, this is a recurring issue. I've had this problem at least 2 other times, to the point where I had to go to PT. But the only thing they addressed was the pain and give me glute exercises, which are already part of my routine and haven't done anything to solve the issue.

1194,Fitness,0,"5/3/1 Beginner to 5/3/1 BBB? Assistance work, scheduling questions Hello! 6'2, \~205 lb male here. Been athletic my whole life with some experience lifting but wanted to make a more serious commitment to getting stronger.

Starting this past summer, I did a couple of months of full-body workouts (which were a bit aimless) and then did 3 months of 5/3/1 for beginners, putting on \~25 lb over the last 4 months (tracking with MyFitnessPal, meant to gain 1 lb/week). Current lifts are squat 10x245, bench 9x185, deadlift 11x270, OHP 7x85 (estimated 1RM 327, 240, 369, 105 respectively).

I know it hasn't been long, but I've had some thoughts:

1. I haven't really liked the 5/3/1 Beginner assistance templates, but like the idea of a super simple hypertrophy/volume program like Boring But Big.
2. I haven't been super accurate with tracking but I want to try to eat for recomposition/maintenance, as I've gotten a bit more of a tummy than I'd like lol. \[Probably a combination of underestimating my intake and overshooting on fats.\] I was planning on getting up to 210 and then cutting, though.
3. I want to make a bit more progress on OHP (and chin/pull-ups), so I plan to have the ""assistance work after the assistance work (BBB sets)"" consist of a couple of these after the 5/3/1 and 5x10 sets:
   1. Dips (I can do 10x10, so should I do like 3x10 weighted?),
   2. Face pulls/shoulder raises (3x10?),
   3. Chin/pull-ups (5xAMRAP?),
   4. Rows (3x8-10?), and
   5. Some ab work (like 3x15 leg raises or something?)

Is it reasonable to switch to 5/3/1 BBB at this point? (I read a couple of posts that it's outdated...?) Are my ideas for assistance work okay? Or should I just stick with 5/3/1 for beginners, or do normal 5/3/1 with some assistance work...

The main things I'm worried about are that (1) I might have problems with time management as I'm going from 3 workouts/week to 4, and I have a particularly rough year coming up in grad school, and (2) that I won't be able to progress without a caloric surplus (especially on BBB).

Currently a typical workout for me looks like; working 2 muscle groups (today was back &amp; abs), 4 exercises per muscle group, 4 sets per exercise, increasing weight (usually by 5kg) &amp; decreasing reps per set (15/12/8/4-6 - last set is to failure for sure, others are just about but not quite). Super setting between the exercises on each muscle group to keep intensity up.

It has recommended adding in drops sets to my 4th set, so decreasing my weight by 20-50% &amp; hitting more reps to failure. However I don’t understand as from what I am reading on drop sets it sounds like I’m already doing it but in reverse? Am I misunderstanding what it’s asking?

Do I need to actually change anything? I am noticing gains so far, total noob gains for sure though.

One approach would be to not lift at all and solely run, taking the hit to barbell strength as is but running overall faster because of less fatigue.

Another approach would be to complete the same running workouts (same mileage, same effort in the correct heart rate zones, same types of workouts wether intervals, tempos, aerobic efforts) while lifting, while accepting the slower pace performance.

The two theories here are heart rate based training versus actual training performance.

I would perform better during training if I were only running. However if I were running and lifting, I would still maintain the same amount of running volume and intensity heart rate wise.

&amp;#x200B;

**BACKSTORY**

About 4 months ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/crve01/5_months_without_lifting_about_to_get_back_into/) in this subreddit asking for some advice on how to best get back into a lifting routine without being completely destroyed by debilitating soreness the next day. Suffice it to say, the advice was incredibly helpful &amp; I wasn't TOO sore after my first few days back (at least not as bad as I expected). So, many thanks to this community, you guys are super knowledgeable!

Well, much to my surprise, since that post I've actually been able to make going to the gym a habit. After many years of stopping &amp; going, while never being able to consistently make it a habit, I've finally done it boys. This may not seem like a big deal, but if you knew the true extent of my inherent laziness &amp; overall inclination for procrastination, you would understand. Since the first day I started (8-19-19), I've gone 6 days a week and have yet to miss a day. I'm wrapping up week 19 now. Honestly, I feel freaking great. I'm a bit bummed I didn't do this sooner. But oh well, I'm happy with the results thus far, and while I still have a long way to go, I'm more motivated than ever.

For me, the secret that enabled me to finally make it habitual ended up being quite simple actually. Before, whenever I'd try to get into a long term workout routine, I was never able to stick with it primarily because after work I'd want to do nothing more than come home &amp; lay around (the laziness I was talking about). It was very hard to force myself to go to the gym. Well, this time around I decided to go to the gym BEFORE work. Here's the thing though. I work 6 days a week starting at 8:00 AM. This is NOT going to be easy. Or so I thought. Turns out, it was ALOT easier. For one, I basically gave myself a rule that if I go into work that day, I MUST go to the gym before hand. It's a mandatory prerequisite. No gym, no work, and vice versa. I fail to go to the gym, I don't work that day which gets me in trouble at work (funny how when you create additional consequences for yourself, motivation seems to MAGICALLY appear). Plus, it solves two problems. One, I get my workout done for the day &amp; still get to go home after work and be as lazy as my heart desires. Two, I no longer need to drink energy drinks to start my day because I feel very mentally focused &amp; full of energy after a workout (much more so than an energy drink would give me). Being that I work in sales, mental clarity is a necessity, and working out before work ensures I will have this mental clarity 100% of the time. So for anybody struggling to stick to a schedule, I highly recommend going before work. The hardest part about it was simply getting started. After day 1, honestly, sticking with it was cake.

&amp;#x200B;

**ROUTINE**

I've been doing the [PHUL routine](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout) for the entire run so far. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday are the lifting days. I do cardio (30 mins on elliptical) and abs on Wednesdays and Sundays. I do about 10 minutes of stretching &amp; 10 minutes on the elliptical before every workout.

Here's the progression of each main lift thus far (I'm using the app called ""Zero to Hero"" for tracking):

* [Bench Press](https://imgur.com/a/BxIZ7AX)
* [Squat](https://imgur.com/a/0sW7F4C)
* [Deadlift](https://imgur.com/a/dVhHNVv)

For lift progression, I'll only move up in weight by 5 lbs once I'm able to hit the max reps &amp; sets for that lift. For example, I'll try incline DB bench press for 4 sets of 12 with 65 lb dumbbells. If I only do 3 sets of 12 and 1 set of 11, I'll try that same weight again the next week. I'll do this until I hit 4x12, then the following week I'll move up to 70 lb dumbbells. Etc. However I don't do this with EVERY lift though. Things like barbell curls, lateral raises, etc. I'll often stick with the same reps and sets at a certain weight for many weeks before deciding to move up in weight.

&amp;#x200B;

**DIET**

As far as diet, admittedly I'm not following a hardcore diet routine. I'm just being more aware of what I'm eating &amp; trying to limit the bad stuff. For breakfast, I eat 2 packets of oatmeal (maple and brown sugar MMMM) and mix a scoop of 25g of protein in it. After my workout, I'll drink a 50g protein shake mixed with a scoop of Field of Greens. For lunch, I started using a food delivery service that delivers to my office. Each meal is 500 calories, and has roughly 50g of protein, 30g of carbs, and 15g or so of fats. For dinner I TRY to eat healthy for the most part, although that doesn't always go according to plan. I'll shoot for grilled chicken, veggies, and potatoes or rice or something. Although some nights I'll have a big heaping plate of spaghetti, or snag me a guacamole burrito from Del Taco. Or a California burrito from Rubios. Yummmm. I figure that if I eat healthy for the first two meals of the day then it's okay to screw around for dinner every now and again. I've cut out sweets almost entirely. Well, sometimes on Saturdays I'll have a cookie or two but that's IT. Saturdays I'll basically eat what I want, but I do make sure to keep the calories to a minimum, as it's my only rest day.

At the end of the day, the most important thing to me when it comes to a diet routine is doing something I can stick with LONG TERM, if not indefinitely. My current routine meets those requirements; I'm actually able to stick with it quite easily. I just hope it's sufficient to get the results I want &amp; that I won't have to further limit myself. Only time will tell!

&amp;#x200B;

So there's where I'm at after almost 19 weeks. While I'm nowhere near my end goal in terms of physique, I'm in the best shape of my life and I feel great. Most importantly, I'm in a routine that I'm 100% certain I can stick with indefinitely. Now, I'm just not sure what to do next. I feel like I'm starting to plateau on my lifts (bench and squat). I'm not sure if it's because I need to consume more calories (I hope not as I'm trying to burn fat), if I need to change my workout routine, or if progression just happens at a much slower rate after the first couple months.

1233,Fitness,0,"Apple Watch Fitness Tracking Just got an Apple Watch for Christmas and I'm pretty overwhelmed by all the fitness tracking stuff. I wanted to see if anyone in the sub had some suggestions on what to try. Here are some things about what I want to track. 

In general, I want to be able to track time &amp; reps for run, swim, &amp; weight workouts. 

When I run, I usually either do a 400m sprint, followed by a 400m slow recover so I'd like to be able to track to lap times for each set. Pretty much same goes for swimming, 100m ""sprint"" followed by an active recovery period. The way I understand, is the GPS in the generic 'Workout' app should be able to automatically track time &amp; distance and know whenever I've completed a lap. I also do long runs/swims but I feel like those would be pretty straightforward to track. Historically, I've just used the chronograph on my timex then manually recorded each lap time but the idea behind the watch was so that I didn't have to do this anymore :) 

For weights, it would be nice if I was an app where I could create routines, so all I'd have to record in the watch is the reps &amp; weight that I perform. Again, I'm used to using the basic notepad but hoping I can move on from that.

I don't really care about steps, heart rate, calories, etc, anything else besides time/reps/weight. So right now I'm thinking I need to use the Apple 'Workout' tracker for cardio, then find a weight training app for the weights, but it would be nice if I could combine the two somehow.

I tried to give as much info as possible but I'd appreciate the help from anyone who's had experience with all of this.",apple watch tracking just got apple watch christmas m pretty overwhelmed tracking stuff wanted sub suggestion try thing want track general want able track time rep run swim weight workout run usually m sprint followed m slow recover d like able track lap time set pretty go swimming m sprint followed active recovery period way understand gps generic workout app able automatically track time distance know completed lap long run swim feel like pretty straightforward track historically just used chronograph timex manually recorded lap time idea watch didn t anymore weight nice app create routine d record watch rep weight perform m used using basic notepad hoping don t really care step heart rate calorie time rep weight right m thinking need use apple workout tracker cardio weight training app weight nice combine tried info possible d appreciate help s experience

1235,Fitness,0,"Unsure about training progress Hi folks,

I'm a very skinny person (184cm, 65kg, 27 yo male) and I've decided, about 4 months ago to start improving my physical condition. I started eating better, going to the gym everyday and taking a scoop of whey to complement my protein intake. About 3 months ago I also started having personal training appointments weekly. While I can see already some good results on my performance and even appearance, I'm a bit confused about how my training is being designed (by my personal trainer). I essentially have a more intense session with her (let's say, upper body) and then I'll do a lighter version of it until the next appointment. Next one we do lower body and then I do about a week of the same lower body routine until we meet again. I've read online quite a lot that you should not be working out the same muscles in a row because it needs rest and most places I looked at suggest that you rotate between muscle groups. Is it ok that I'm doing the same every day for periods of 7 days? I'm thinking it might be just because I'm such a beginner that, at the level I do it, it doesn't matter, but I'm also curious about whether or not I should raise that question to my personal trainer and start maybe rotating muscles to get better results.

1237,Fitness,0,"Announcement: New r/Fitness Community Thread Series - ""Routine Campfires"" - Starting in January Happy Howdydays everyone!

For the last year, we've been running the [Community Campfire](https://thefitness.wiki/resources/community-campfires/) thread series and it's been a pretty resounding success that has contributed a lot of great information to our community resources in an organized way. But, we've reached a point where all the reasonable topics that fit within the scope of the Campfires have been covered, and it's time to ~~take them out behind the shed~~ retire them.

For 2020, we're going to be building on the Campfire concept with a new series of community discussion threads - Routine Campfires! Every two weeks, we'll focus on one routine from the Recommended Routines page, and the Campfire thread will be a place for anybody to ask any question they have about that routine specifically. These threads will be stickied just as the Community Campfires were to help them keep attention. A comment in the thread itself will also be stickied that will have an index of links to questions within the thread, so it's easier to navigate for anyone who comes to it in the future.

I haven't worked out the full schedule yet, but the first Campfire will get - fired up - on **January 6th**, and since it's New Year's Resolution season it seems appropriate for the very first one to cover the [r/Fitness Basic Beginner Routine](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/). On January 20th, we'll move forward from there. I'll update this thread with the schedule once I've got it all written down.

In the meantime, I'll leave this thread open for any questions, discussion, or praise of my genius that anyone wants to share.

Cheers!

1238,Fitness,0,"Peloton strength workouts?

I reached failure in each set with the kettlebell and i did 2 or 3 more reps without weight. After that, I couldn't do another exercise that involved my quads.

1241,Fitness,0,"6'4 Deadlifts feel awkward, rack pulls instead? As someone who's moderately tall doing a deadlift feels extremely awkward. It seems as though my form starts to fail as I get 2-3 inches from the bar when bending down. Should I start with rack pulls then slowly move to deadlifts? Am I losing out on anything from doing that? Also, will I ever be able to deadlift after working on rack pulls or am I forever cursed with awkward deadlifts?

Edit: some seem to think this is just me whining in an attempt to excuse myself from doing a deadlift. This was simply a question, more or less, to see how other tall people deal with this. The consensus seems to be that hex bar and rack pulls are fine. Deadlifts will always feel odd and practice makes perfect.

1246,Fitness,0,"Review of Recent Fitness Studies VII: More Squats, Blood Flow Restriction and Strength Training Hello, everyone. Hope you are all having a wonderful Christmas season. It is a time for family to get together as well as eat a lot of food. However, I hope everyone has been keeping fit. As usual, I've collected a few, very recent studies about fitness, health and nutrition to condense them into easy-to-read summaries for all of you. I hope to create some discussion below! Any tips for writing, presentation, analysis or anything else would be greatly appreciated. Enjoy!

Squat depth is a contentious subject in the fitness literature due to its uncertainties in the context of injury risk, muscle hypertrophy, strength gains, translation into sports performance and more. The literature teeters to both ends of the spectrum as Hartmann et al. (2012) showed superior functional adaptations for the full squat when compared to shallower squats. However, more recently, Rhea et al. (2016) found that quarter squats may actually be better for improving sprinting and jumping. Thus, Pallarés et al. (2019) sought to clear up the doubt by comparing full squats, parallel squats and half squats with the following outcomes in mind: one repetition maximum, maximum propulsive velocity, jump tests, sprint tests, Wingate tests as well as physical disability measurements as a proxy for injury risk. Let’s just quickly go over what some of this means. A full squat in the context of this study is a very deep squat where the thighs meet the calves on the descent. A parallel squat is where the crease made at the groin is in line with the top of the knee. A half squat is descending until your knee joint forms a 90deg angle. The outcomes will be explained as we go along.

50 men with a squat training history were recruited and split into four groups: full squat, parallel squat, half squat and a control group. The control group obviously did not partake in any resistance training so we can see if external factors that are not being measured are at play. Training was twice a week for ten weeks and the load slowly increased from 60% to 80% of their one repetition maximum. Participants did 4–5 sets of 4–8 repetitions with four minutes of rest between sets. An interesting aspect of this study is that instead of determining one repetition maxima traditionally (lifting heavier and heavier until you cannot lift against the resistance, essentially paying attention to the load lifted), they used mean propulsive velocity which just means they measured the speed at which the bar moves and once it slows enough, we have determined the one repetition maximum. This is better because we can track objective variables and numbers here. Using this velocity-based method is valid as it was used in a study with the same lifts recently and it showed a close relationship with the traditional, load-based method (Martínez-Cava et al., 2019). Several familiarization sessions were done to learn the exercises before the ten week training programme began.

The full squat group saw improvements across all outcomes. They increased their one repetition maximum in all three types of squats. They had better sprints and jumps as well as better Wingate test results. The wingate test is essentially a test for power (work done over time) on a cycling machine. The parallel squat group had similar results to the full squat group though to smaller extents. The half squat group made did not make great strength gains even for the half squat one repetition maximum. The power hardly changed and the peak power actually decreased. Jump heights improved slightly however, the sprint times were unchanged. The half squat group actually saw the worst results when it came to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a series of likert scales (ratings of subjective feeling) initially used in hospitals to evaluate pain, stiffness and functional disability in osteoarthritis (joint degeneration, generally in knees, hips and hands) patients, however, it has been used for a wide variety of rheumatological disorders. The half squat group saw large increases in all variables measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, unlike the other groups. Deeper squats may not have an increased knee injury risk despite higher knee flexion angles because of various reasons. The wrapping effect is a mechanism in which the quadriceps tendon makes better contact with the femur as we descend further in the squat rendering the knee joint more stable. The soft-tissue contact between the calf and the thigh in a deep squat may also provide support (Hartmann, Wirth &amp; Klusemann, 2013).

Like previous studies, there was a degree of specificity that came to light. Groups made the best strength gains at the depth they trained at. However, the full squat group still made better strength gains in the half squat if we make group to group comparisons. Another point to note is that the control group had several decrements in performance due to detraining. This further reinforces the idea that the trained population will suffer in performance after extended periods of sedentary lifestyle.

**TL;DR:** The deeper you go in a squat, the better your outcomes (strength, sprints, power, jumping) and this is likely without an increased risk for injury. (Reminder that this study was only done in trained men so keep that mind with application to populations).

———————————-

Flexion of the lumbar spine (basically the spine segment located in the lower back) has long been thought to be associated with lower back pain. This has led to interventions in occupational health (“proper” biomechanics and use of braces) as well as in the fitness world especially in exercises such as the deadlift. However, is the association at hand really as strong as we think? Saraceni et al. (2019) very recently conducted a meta-analysis (pooling studies together) / review on the literature regarding this very question. They specifically aimed to see i) if lumbar flexion is a risk factor for lower back pain and ii) if the degree of lumbar flexion is different between those with or without lower back pain.
In total, they managed to gather 12 studies with a total of 697 participants for analysis. Overall, the quality of evidence was deemed to be low, however, there was no evidence to suggest that lumbar flexion was a risk factor for lower back pain though lumbar load may be a risk factor. To quote:

*“Critically, to date no study that has directly measured the lumbar spine during lifting, has found a relationship between LBP and greater lumbar flexion”*

People with lower back pain, on average, actually flexed slightly less at the lumbar spine when lifting. Unfortunately, this finding was clouded in heterogeneity which means that the papers that were pooled together in analysis were conducted so differently from each other that it becomes difficult to put them together. This finding may also be a result of reverse causality i.e: people with lower back pain flex less because of the pain, not the other way around. Careful applications of this study into resistance training world must be done as the maximum load of all the studies included was 12 kilograms.

**TL;DR:** No evidence to suggest a relationship between the degree of lumbar flexion and low back pain.

Blood flow restriction training is gaining more traction in the training world as more and more studies appreciate its efficacy. It is executed by partially occluding the targeted muscle(s)’ blood supply (via tourniquet or other means) and training with this occlusion. It has its place in recreational training as well as in rehabilitation as it allows healing joints/tissues to exercise with lighter loads while still reaping the benefits you would receive from higher loads. An important aspect to consider, however, is the effect of blood flow restriction training on the tendons involved. This is critical because if muscle adapts to a greater extent then its tendons do, an imbalance between the structures may lead to injury. Centner et al. (2019) took 38 untrained men and separated them into three groups: a group that trained with 70–85% of one repetition maximum loads with normal resistance training, a group with 20–35% of one repetition maximum loads with blood flow restricted training and one control group. The training groups followed their respective exercise programmes for 14 weeks. The traditional resistance training group did three sets of standing calf raises and three sets of sitting calf raises with 6–12 repetitions each. For the other group, the scheme was similar but one set of 30 repetitions was done before each exercise so in total eight sets would be done as opposed to six in the other group. 15 repetitions were done for the rest of the sets. The pressure used was set at a 50% occlusion and was kept on between sets but not between exercises. Training was held three times per week.

After 14 weeks, the achilles tendon (the tendon which joins the calf muscle to the ankle) cross-sectional area grew similarly between training groups. The same can be said about gastrocnemius (calf muscle) cross-sectional area, muscle stiffness and maximum voluntary torque (force produced by calf muscle). Young’s modulus changes (stress divided by strain, a property that tells us the stiffness of a material) was said to be statistically insignificant between and within groups though the high load training group had an increased Young’s modulus while the blood flow restricted group’s had decreased. Increases in stiffness are likely because of the increased size of the tendon rather than any changes in the material properties of the tendon. The tendon adaptations we find in the blood flow restricted group may be explained by the theory of metabolic stress inducing an increased production of fibroblasts, a cell which supports a tendon’s integrity by synthesizing collagen and other structural proteins.
A valuable part of the study that is missing is another group that trains with low loads but without blood flow occlusion as that would help isolate the variable of blood flow occlusion from other variables such as load. Another limitation that the authors highlighted was that the method of measuring tendon cross-sectional changes (via ultrasound) is not the most accurate technique especially when compared to sensitive procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

**TL;DR:** Positive tendon adaptations still occur in those who do blood flow restricted training (for young, untrained men).

Over the years, we have begun to realize that muscle hypertrophy does not require as much as we thought for it to occur. Low volumes, low frequencies, low repetitions, high rest — they all seem to work. Even intensities as low as 30% of your 1 repetition maximum are enough to induce hypertrophy (Mitchell et al., 2012). Can the same be said about muscle strength? Androulakis‑Korakakis, Fisher &amp; Steele (2019) performed a meta-analysis and review on the subject amassing six different studies total. It was found that volume as low as one set of 8–10 repetitions per week for 10 weeks was enough for muscle strength to increase. All sets in the studies were done to muscle failure. Most studies had some form of progression between training sessions. Loads were generally within the 70–90% 1 repetition maximum range so if strength changes can reliably occur at lower loads (&lt;60% 1 repetition maximum) is a question that still has yet to be answered. This point may be moot from an efficiency standpoint as working with lower loads would require higher repetitions to failure thus taking up more time.

We also do not know if we can get significant strength gains at repetitions lower than five to six assuming while still maintaining a frequency of one set per week. Furthermore, these findings are limited to the squat and bench press only, the deadlift unfortunately does not have enough research to make any concrete statements. Most of this data was gleaned from trained athletes, however, while they were technically “resistance-trained”, their personal records and training history would only be considered to be at an intermediate level from an advanced perspective. Despite having few studies to work with, all the studies were of high methodological quality. One final limitation is that these results can only be extrapolated to males. The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).

**TL;DR:** ""The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).”

With bodybuilding, it is often recommended to eat at a caloric surplus (ie. eating more calories than you burn daily) while training. This is sound advice because your body does need more energy for building the new tissue, maintaining the tissue and dealing with the altered metabolism that the body undergoes with training and muscle tissue accretion. However, there are a lot more variables that go into this and there is an immense amount of nuance. Slater et al. (2019) aimed to present and discuss all the variables as well as unravel all the confusion. Do we need a surplus in the first place? It would seem so given the theory above. Energy restrictions have been shown to interfere with muscle protein synthesis but this can be alleviated with training and a higher protein intake. So it is likely still possible to experience hypertrophy in a caloric deficit but this is probably only reasonably applicable to the overweight or untrained (more research needed!). Despite eating a caloric surplus being ubiquitous as a guideline, it is interesting to note that there is no controlled trial where they studied the relationship between a caloric surplus and muscle hypertrophy from resistance training over an extended period of time. However, we can look at overfeeding studies where participants are eating at a caloric surplus while not resistance training. In these studies, we do see gains in fat-free mass.

There are mathematical formulae out there to calculate what is the ideal surplus for your hypertrophy goals, however, no formulae takes into account all the complex biological processes that occur with muscle hypertrophy. These formulae are also based off of people who do not resistance train. Metabolism can be vastly different in athletes. For example, diet-induced thermogenesis (heat produced/calories burnt simply from eating) can be higher for athletes as their protein intakes are generally higher (takes more energy to digest protein). There is also the question of how you should distribute the surplus throughout the day or week. For example, carbohydrates may be good before or during high volume training yet there is no strong research in that area. Another common example is having a larger surplus on training days to make up for the training. The macronutrient distribution of the surplus is also relevant. The authors recommend 4–7 g/kg/day of carbohydrates, 35% of caloric intake with fat and 1.6 g/kg/day of protein. Three meals spread across the day with snacks interspersed between also appears to be effective. In total, a 360–480 daily calorie surplus seems to be an appropriate number to start with but it requires constant review throughout the training programme.

**TL;DR:** Not a lot is known about a caloric surplus and its effects on muscle hypertrophy while training. However, a small surplus of 360–480 kcal/day with appropriate macronutrient distribution appears to be a good starting point for most people wanting to build muscle.

1249,Fitness,0,"How can 'Greasing the Groove' be incorporated in to a routine? To me, GtG is doing a single set well short of failure (50% max rep-count) several times a day, with a 15+ minute break between each set. The goal is to increase strength, with a big focus on improving neuromuscular efficiency.

I really don't know anything about this, but:

1) Isn't there a limit to how much you can improve neuromuscular efficiency? Especially as you become a more advanced athlete, surely your NM efficiency is already really high? Although I recently saw Devon Larrat (armwrestler) describe his new training routine, I'm not sure if he knows GtG exists but recently he's being doing 4 sessions of low rep count sets throughout the day with long rests, and he says it's been great for improving his strength. He's been armwrestling for 20 years.

2) Is GtG effective at building muscles, gaining mass, causing hypetrophy? This links with (1), sure it's great to become stronger but aren't you going to reach a point where the answer is 'more muscle fibers'?

3) Does GtG have a place is body building, where high reps, close to failure, seem to be favoured?

With this is mind, who is GtG for?

M22 5'9, [bulked 156 - 170 lbs from June '19 till december '19](https://imgur.com/a/3wVMJXJ) after a [cut 196lbs to 156lbs from dec '18 till June '19](https://imgur.com/a/HzyBLI9)(without working out though, unfortunately). 

Current 1rms estimates are:

S/B/D 210/200/240, and OHP/pendlay row 125/180.

##Cut

During the cut I ate around 1400kcal, started learning better healthy habbits, cooking for myself, etc...

Had high load in university so didn't start working out, although I could have probably made time now that I look at it. But I did start looking for routines so I could dive right in after the semester ends. Also watching and reading more fitnesd related stuff.

##Bulk

Overestimated TDEE at first, shot for about 2500kcal. As you can see from the pics, gained more fat than I'd like, so readjusted for about 2200kcal.

Right now I'm more of a recomp at 1900-2000 a day though.

1266,Fitness,0,"6 Month progress and getting ready for the new year. 41/M /5ft 7 / 234lbs - 200lbs

Soo here's my story about how my life changed :). 6 years ago i was blessed with the birth of my youngest daughter and shortly after her birth i was cursed with a dislocated knee and MCL issue. I was a long distance runner averaging roughly about 90-100 miles a week. Since i was healing and spending time bonding with my daughter I kept eating like i was still running and not. Be hold 5 years later I went from 160lbs to 234lbs... I guess we can call that a dirty bulk? Either way june of this year my dad went in for heart surgery and I told myself enough is enough. Running didn't sound fun but a buddy of mine is a first responded and avid Cross-fitter. We chatted a lot about the benefits of strength training and it appealed to me. Since i'm not in my 20's any more and i like the time spent with my kids 1-1.5 hours at the gym seemed way more acceptable (plus there's a drop area for them) any ways it's not the crazy transformations you see within 6 months but i'm proud and I can still knock down a sub 20 minute 5k ;).

Here's the information on what i've done plus pictures.

Photo:  [https://imgur.com/a/uVBJTh6](https://imgur.com/a/uVBJTh6)

Diet: I don't really count or look at my macro's. what' i've done is portion less and do a Paleo diet with intermittent fasting.

Workout: I'm on a 4 day split routine. I go to the gym 7 days a week but every 5th day is mobility workouts and 40 minutes of cardio. I don't know what my body fat % is as I'm not really trying to shred just lift and have fun. I'll probably try to shred in February or march once all the new years resolutions have melted away from the gym.

1268,Fitness,0,"From skinny to slightly less skinny - M 21 / 6ft 1 / 138lbs - 153lbs (15 months) First, before - after photos: [https://imgur.com/a/btoShYp](https://imgur.com/a/btoShYp) 

This is not a ""holy shit"" transformation story but its one im proud of. I believe I have made largely lean gains, and it seems bizarre that I would have better ab definition with an added 6/7kgs. I see a lot of insane transformations on reddit so i wanted to post one for the average guys

&amp;#x200B;

**Numbers**

Starting: M / 21 / 6ft 1 (185cm) / 63kg (138lbs)

Ending: M / 22 / 6ft1 (185cm) / 69.5kg (153lbs)

Duration: September 2018 - December 2019 (15 months)

&amp;#x200B;

Start lifts: the bar

End lifts: all 3 x 5 max (i havent trained 1RM)

* DL: 120kg (264lbs)
* Squat: 90kg (198lbs)
* Bench, dumbbells: 28kg (61lbs)

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

I played a lot of sport growing up, something like 5 - 6 hours hockey per week + tennis or football every lunch + 1-2 hours badminton a week. Knowing what I now know about nutrition, I estimate my calorie intake growing up to have been 2000 - 2400 calories a day, hence a substantial caloric deficit

In summer 2015 I lifted weights with 2 friends for about 2 - 3 months. It was absolutely dreadful in terms of quality / discipline and consistency. I doubt I put on a pound of muscle in that period and its a nice reminder that lifting did not come easily to me

&amp;#x200B;

**Routine**

September 2018 I followed a nice, crappy **fuckarounditis** for 6 weeks, some routine of BB forum. Do not follow this step

Late October 2018 I begun **Greyskull LP** which I absolutely would recommend to any beginner. I saw great gains, good strength progress and it was a great balance between volume and intensity. During this time I did cardio twice a week, always a rowing workout (variants of 2ks, 1ks) + abs (8 minute abs video off Youtube)

March 2019 I moved to **Reddit PPL** which I am still on. Here is a link to the workout:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a\_linear\_progression\_based\_ppl\_program\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) which explains it better than i can

At this point I was pretty serious about fitness so I welcomed the extra time in the gym. I made a few modifications but otherwise followed the template exactly:

1. I alternate weighted pull ups (5x5) with bodyweight pullups (3x failure) on pull days
2. I add shrugs to push day, between incline bench and tricep isolations
3. Added barbell hip thrusts (3 x 12) between RDLs and leg press and damn I could not recommend this addition enough
4. Replaced barbell bench press with dumbbells. This was simply because my gym was too busy and the waiting time was infuriating. In any case I really enjoy dumbbell bench, especially the stretch right at the bottom. But in due course I will change back to barbell bench

I still play badminton / squash about 2 - 4 hours a week and do cardio once a week which involves a 20 min run, 8 minute abs workout ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWjTnBmCHTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWjTnBmCHTY)) and do farmers walks (3 sets of walking a certain route in my gym with heavy dumbbells).

&amp;#x200B;

**Diet**

Obivously this was the big ""change"" I needed to make. I now eat **3200-3600 calories a day,** with 3600 calories on days I play squash

I do not aim for specific macro targets. I simply eat 2 meals with protein per day + two protein shakes, and stuff myself full of veggies and fruit each day (often hit 10+ per day)

""Standard day"" eating:

Breakfast: 3 eggs + 2 pieces brown bread, orange juice

2 protein shakes (one before gym, one after) each containing: 200ml milk, 50g greek yoghurt, 20g peanut butter, 20g ground oats, 1 scoop gold standard whey

Lunch: a vegatarian sandwhich / roll / bagel etc. + falafel + various salads

Dinner: whatever is going, just 600cals minimum. Faves include tuna sweetcorn mayo pasta, salmon and potatoes, curries and stir fries are easy to just add nuts, seeds, sauces to and get the calories up

Snacks: apple, banana, raisins every day + avocado, peanuts, cereal bar, bowl of cereal, malt loaf, whatever is needed for the target that day

For the first 10 months I used my fitness pal to track my calories and weighed most of the food i ate, every day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Weight gain**

I weigh myself every morning, same conditions. Here is a photo of my weight change, to give you an idea of how up and down my progress really was: [https://imgur.com/a/80WwH3N](https://imgur.com/a/80WwH3N) (the first reading was in august 2018, before i started lifting)

Caveat: I went on several hiking trips over the last 12 months which explain the sharp drops in weight - I would come back 2/3 kgs lighter, but a decent chunk of the weight loss was water weight + glycogen (from not taking creatine).

&amp;#x200B;

**Things I wish i had known before I started** (mostly directed at tall skinny guys, sorry):

1. Starting skinny is in some ways a blessing in disguise. Every pound of muscle you put on will be nice and visible. And more importantly you can slowly, steadily bulk for months or years, which translates to more energy, all the time
2. If your grip starts failing you in DLs, try using the smaller barbell (15kg in my gym), its easier to grip. And then change to hook grip, I wish I had done this far earlier
3. Take better before / progress photos than I did. From lots of angles, lightings, poses etc. it feels a bit funny at first but its worth it. And dont throw away your old t shirts
4. Counting calories was absolutely non-negotiable (along with face pulls) at the start
5. Dont tell a group of girls you eat 3500 calories a day. RIP.
6. The barbell will hurt your back during squats. It took me about 8 months to get enough ""meat"" and feel of the bar for it to sit comfortably, you just have to perservere through
7. Asian squatting every day for several minues was extremely effective in improving my hip mobility and squat technique

&amp;#x200B;

**Going forward**

I will keep lean bulking for the foreseeable, probably another year at least. Long term, I would like to transition into calisthenics because i think some of those moves are fucking cool. But not until I have built some appreciable muscle mass. In terms of realistic strength goals, Id like to bench my BW, squat 1.5x and DL 2x my BW.

So I was wondering if I should go that workout anyway or maybe try something different like some sort of circuit where I tend to sweat more, because with the PPL I usually take 40-45 mins to workout and even tho I lift the more I can for 8-12 reps, I end the workout fine and not really tired.",hey doing ppl linked wiki month think need bigger challenge read program phat guess x day week insteresting changing idea personal trainer gym just dude thats supposed degree s helping said moving plan workout focusing strength rep set isn t bench little usually kg bench x rep weight kg wondering workout maybe try different like sort circuit tend sweat ppl usually min workout tho lift rep end workout fine really tired

1276,Fitness,0,"RPT for accessories/isolations? Hi all

I've done a bit of an overhaul of my lifting routine and am giving reverse pyramid training a go - 3sets at 6,8 and 12 rep goals. Its early days but I'm enjoying it. I've structured my programme as 3 compound lifts in RPT style, finished up by 1 isolation / accessory.

At the moment I'm doing these isolations as 3  straight sets of 12 reps. My question is, is there a place for RPT on these movements too, or do they work better as straight sets.

If the answer is straight sets, should I lower the weight each set to continue to be able to hit the 12 reps, or be satisfied with something like 12,9,8 reps all at the same weight?

I've recently been taking barre classes. In the classes, we use resistance bands. They're placed anywhere from our thighs, calves, or even wrists for various movements. 

However, I currently have some pretty big thighs. (It's definitely not a bad thing, I'm working on it, but it's not a bad thing.) Something I struggle with is that I find that lots of time during the moments are spent fixing the band since they seem to roll if I move in certain ways, so it ends up taking away from my workout. When the bands are rolled on my thighs, it's uncomfortable. 

Does anyone have any tips for this?

1285,Fitness,0,"How accurate should I be when punching in food into MyFitnessPal? I'm 6'1 around 78kg (170lb) and my diet is relatively inconsistent and from what I've read so far it appears that what I used to think was good metabolism is really just not me eating enough. 

I downloaded MyFitnessPal and I have to say I got frustrated with it pretty quickly. I wanted to be super accurate but when trying to punch in values for a shake I made I couldn't tell whether I was supposed to put in the ingredients manually or pick from preset shakes, none of which are truly identical to the one I had. I eat out a lot so those are easier but as I've added in a decent amount of home-cooked food I feel overwhelmed at the thought of figuring out how to put in the food correctly.

Do you guys sometimes give semi-accurate estimations for some of the foods you eat or would you say that it's important to be super specific with weights (ie. Using a scale)? Does it get easier over time and it's just something I gotta power through?

1289,Fitness,0,"Training complete beginner, looking for thoughts I'm planning on helping my wife get in shape. Right now she can't curl more than 5 lbs, and bench more than 25 so at a very beginner state. She wants to get in shape, is currently going to a personal trainer but says its too expensive, so I'm coming up with an alternate plan. 

The goal is to recomp and build primarily strength and some cardio. On the diet side, adjusting protein intake to 0.7g / lb.

I'm thinking of two options

**Option 1 - a variety of classes before ramping up to strength training**

1x a week kettlebell class - seems like its low impact and can get her skills in a tool that can get a workout in very quickly

2x a week TRX class - lower impact, not as demanding as lifts, and if she learns these skills she can get a session in wherever we go

1x a week some form of cardio

Daily stretching and foam rolling with me - start working on mobility

Do this until the workouts become very doable, and then add a 1x a week full body lifting session with me where I train her on all the lifts (3x5 squat, dead, press and bench).

This eventually transitions (after a few months) to a 3x a week starting weightlifting program + cardio on off days when possible

**Option 2 - linear progression immediately**

Dive into a beginner linear progression weight lifting program right away and start the progressive overload on day 1. 

Option 2 seems the most straightforward with the fastest gains. The reason I am hesitant on 2 is that someone who is not trained might have mobility issues, strength imbalances, may not be able to push hard enough, etc and she may benefit from a slower ramp up and varied instruction from others. However if the goal is to build strength option 2 is probably a lot faster 

What do you all think?

Edit: thanks for the feedback. I think asking what the trainer is doing is a good idea, I actually don’t know and should probably find out.

Her goals are not that concrete, I think we can narrow down on them more.

I leaned towards strength training because that’s what I know and can coach. Actually haven’t done much else other than snowboarding and cycling. But I get the feedback that only do it if she’s into it. That was my hesitation from starting option 2 right away as well, there’s this gap from newb to powerlifting that seems like it needs to be bridged

(Sorry for bad English and or mistakes) 

Hey guys. I’ve been putting off losing weight for an extremely long time. I’ve struggled with my body since junior high. I’m now 24, 5’10 and 215 pounds at 26% body fat and recently have decided to make a change for the better 

I told myself at the beginning of the month that I am going to make a difference and not wait for a “New Years resolution” to start. I know half of the battle is diet, and I’ve gotten it down to the T. 

I track my food intake daily and make sure I hit my macros in my 1750 calorie intake at 30% fat, 40% protein 30%carbs. And I do make sure it’s lean protein, good fats (avocados), and good carbs (oatmeal, sweet potatoes, etc...).  I’ve lost 5 pounds already just from diet alone this month. 


I know that diet is over half the battle, which bring me to the other part: working out. 

I tried to incorporate an expert bodyspace gym plan (in my head higher intensity will yield better results). It was the Kris gethin workout and I hit it hard as I could for day 1. Two days later and I can’t extend my arms. I had to miss yesterday’s session because of it (still did cardio though). I did do a warmup and cool down cardio session of 10 minutes each. But I didn’t stretch for too long, maybe that was the issue?


Any tips on what workout plans would be good for me? My main goal is to lose fat but I’d like to keep my muscle if possible. I know you lose some lean mass on a cut though. 
I’ve been reading that beginners to the gym should should do full body workouts to maximize gains since they’re newer but I’d like to hear your thoughts.

1311,Fitness,0,"How hard should I push myself? Ok guys so I had the big realization that I’m freaking huge. I always tried to avoid looking at the scale but I finally bit the bullet and looked. I’m 311Ibs. The fattest I’ve ever been in my life. I’m angry, I’m sad, but mostly angry at myself for letting it get to this stage. I’m about to head to the gym for the first time in years tomorrow and I don’t know what my limit is or how hard should I push myself. I just want to lose this fat and return to the weight of my teenage years.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the overwhelming support. I’ll start by setting up miniature goals first. Changing my diet is gonna be hard. A lot of you guys are saying that I should just cut back and not completely cut off the tempting unhealthy food all the while introducing new healthy foods into my diet. I’ve been thinking about trying out the 1 free personal trainer session at the gym and ask them about some tips. I have to come up with a workout schedule that is suited for my current body and then gradually pick up the pace. From what a lot of people are saying is try not to go too hard in the first few weeks and try to find what my limits are while gradually losing the weight and then that’s when I can go more intense with the workout. I thank everyone in this sub for helping me start my journey. Thank you.

Edit 2: I also feel as though I should give everyone more info about me to get even more advice. I’m 25(M), weigh 311Ib, 6’1”, and I have job that does keep me active outside. By active I mean that I’m on my feet most of the time. 

UPDATE: So I finally went to the gym today! Only to find out they were closing in 10 mins. So used this time wisely and decided to schedule my free personal trainer session and ask about their classes and what not.

I sometimes use a float board and just kick and other times I lay on my back and use both of my arms at the same time to do a type of backstroke.

Do I need to do “proper mechanics” to get the full benefit of swimming? I swim for about 30 minutes and my heart is definitely pumping when I’m going. My legs are on fire right now so I know I got a good workout in.

I just feel like people are judging my way of doing laps. Everyone is so intense and fast and they use proper techniques! I am *very* slow compared to everyone else. 

I just have terrible knees for a 28 year old and I don’t want to make them any worse with impact exercises. I run *occasionally* but I feel it in my knees for a few days afterwords. So I figured I’d give swimming laps a try.

Am I just too much in my own head? Are people actually not judging me like I think they are? Am I still getting the toning benefits of swimming?

1319,Fitness,0,"33M, 6'3'' (191 cm), 157 lbs (71 kg) -&gt; 172 lbs (78 kg), 5.5 months progress with pics Before &amp; After Pics

[https://imgur.com/a/cLs0X0A](https://imgur.com/a/cLs0X0A)

Hello everyone,

I am a 33M that has started working out now for the first time in my life. During my live I have always been very skinny and my weight has always been around 150 lbs (68 kg) to 158 lbs (72 kg), which I think it is quite low for my height (6'3''/191 cm). My diet was always very bad (sweets, skipping meals, etc.) and I was very sedentary (maybe once a week some team sports). I decided it was time to change this. Funnily, I found my motivation in philosophy when I read what Socrates said ""It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable"".

**Exercise routine**

I started for two months doing the beginners routine and then switched to GCZLP (3 days) for 3 months. On GCZLP I did the barebone routine of the wiki (1T1, 1T2, 1T3) and midway I added some extra T3s (mostly biceps/triceps 2 days and extra leg work the other 2 days). Not sure if that was the best but I thought it was better than nothing. I could progress adding 5lbs/2.5kg and 10lbs/5kg to upper and lower lifts every week. I started very low on lower lifts because I wanted to be sure on the form. On upper lifts I had to switch to 6x2 at the end. My caculated 1RMs at the end of the 3 months (2 weeks ago) where:

Bench 145lbs 66.5kg

Squat 175lbs 80kg

Deadlift 210lbs 95kg

OHP 100lbs 45kg

I know, I am very very weak still but I feel I was much weaker at the beginning (I couldn't barely lift the barbell on the OHP).

I also tried to do some abs work 1 or 2 times per week. Basically a circuit of plank variations for 25 minutes (I got a previous injury in the groin section of the abs and the PT told me that I should never do crunches, that it was better to do planks).

Sometimes because of work/travel I couldn't hit the gym and follow the program closely. I would then improvise: one-day trial gym, hotel gym, dumbell and bodyweight exercises at home, taking some bands with me... always with the thought in mind of ""better suboptimal training than skipping it"".

After GCZLP I took a week off and last week I started with PHUL. Lots of new exercises, it is pretty exciting and motivating for me.

**Diet**

I calculated my TDEE and eated at a surplus about 3000 kcal (of which 150-200 g proteins). I spent a couple months tracking closely the calories and macros on myfitnesspal to get a feel of what does each food means. This was not sustainable for me so now I do it a bit more approximated. I feel my approach is still working (my weight increase is steady) but it is not a burden for me. Every time I have been trying to move more towards plant protein based diet. I meal prep for the whole week so usually I make two dishes and that's what I eat for lunch/dinner all the week. I cook exclusively with olive oil. I can have one or two junk meal foods a week. I didn't drink much before (maybe 2-4 drinks a week) but now I drink even less (1-2 drinks a month).

Typical food day:

Breakfast: 3 eggs, milk (first cow, then soja) with a scoop of weight gainer, 2 dark bread toasts

Lunch: Pasta with some sauce, (vegan) meatballs and veggies or beef stew with veggies and white rice

Post-training: a banana and a protein shake (1 scoop on soja milk)

Dinner: (Vegan) meat with fries and veggies or salmon with rice and veggies

Before sleep: one glass of milk and some nuts

During the day: I try to take 3 fruits a day and I am constantly snacking on nuts, sometimes I add a toast with peanut butter and ocassionaly some chocolate.

Supplements: none

**Sleep**

I found this to be very important for me. I sleep usually 7h30 a day, aiming always for 8h. Really, sleeping is so so important, it has changed my life.

**General feeling**

I really feel more healthy and with more energy during the day (except after hitting the gym where sometimes I want to kill myself). My abs injury doesn't hurt anymore, before it used to hurt from time to time. Also less back pain that I had from time to time. All in all I am very happy to have moved towards this direction, and I know that I might not be the most disciplined and my gains won't be the most impressive but I am very happy!

**Where to go from here**

I want to keep gaining weight and to complete 3 months of the PHUL program.

I would like to be more strict on the abs routine. How to define them? Is it possible to do it for someone like me? I feel my routine is very random. Is there any routine out there that you recommend?

I also feel (and know) my mobility/flexibility is very bad. I am stiff as a stick. Is there any kind of recommendation to improve on that direction? Any ""workout"" plan I could do at night for 15-30 min before going to sleep?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been weight training sporadically since 15 but the strongest I've been since recently was senior year of high school when I had gym class. My total then was probably a higher then that listed for my previous total in the above table while also at a weight of 147 lbs. My first experiment with powerlifting was with the Stronglifts 5x5 program beginning august of 2018. I felt that I stagnated quickly then my motivation left me and I made no progress. I made a new years resolution to try to seriously build strength as opposed to lifting for aesthetic purposes and picked up the nSuns 4-day program when I was 18. This program involves a 5/3/1 progression with a main lift (such as those tabulated above) and then 6 deload sets. Following this, there are 8 sets of a secondary lift such as sumo, front squat, etc. then accessories as I see fit. My attendance was rocky initially but I was weak enough then to still make consistent progress. 

The clear progression proved addictive and soon enough my attendance improved. A stalling OHP (it is only included as an accessory lift in the 4-day program) caused me to switch to the nSuns 5-day program sometime in April as it had a day with OHP as the main lift. This worked very well. While I tried to continue with the accessory work around august I had dropped it entirely unless I was injured.

**Diet:**

Literally whatever. I probably get around 3000 calories a day on average, usually anywhere from 2500-4000. I try and get a good amount of protein in but I barely ever even tracked macros.

**Injuries:**

I don't let injuries stop me from going to the gym but they do change what I focus on. There were 5 weeks this fall where I didn't do bench press due to what I believe to be elbow tendinitis and 2 weeks where I didn't OHP because my rear delt/ rotator cuff felt tight. I stopped doing weighted pull ups all together because of the elbow pain. While my injuries were never severe I was mindful of aggravating them. I would do lighter cable or dumbbell exercises such as delt raises, cable flys and tricep extensions when I felt injured.

**Supplements/ Equipment:**

I lift in a pair of busted van lows. I added a belt for squat and deadlift in late august. I didn't feel much difference in my deadlift but my squat feels much more stable in the hole. I think that improvement of my lifting form probably contributed more to my total than the belt. I supplement with creatine (5g a day when I take it), a multivitamin, preworkout, and protein powder. The creatine and protein powder I don't get around to taking too often anymore but I was pretty consistent over the summer.

**Sleep:**

Despite being in my senior year as an engineering student I try and usually succeed in getting at least 6.5 hrs a sleep on weekdays and more on the weekends despite classwork and grad school apps. I say I average around 7.5 hrs.

**Future Plans:**

I am part of the powerlifting club on my campus and will likely compete in their charity meet this next semester. I would like to achieve my estimated 1RMs in the gym and improve on them. I was planning on testing them over this week but finals got in the way more than I expected. I succeed in squatting 435 but failed at 455. I'm just short of my goal for the year  (an 1150 total). I would like a 1350 total by this time next year. I do not feel that I am stagnating yet so I am optimistic in achieving this goal. I'd also like to cut down to around 10% body fat throughout next year. I don't really care about being super big. I was planning to stay around 83kg so I could compete in that division of the USAPL in the future but I shot right past that weight.",m lb kg lb kg month progress pic imgur u wawsg imgur nstc ny imgur ze vuzp imgur udp utu lift lb bench press deadlift squat ohp estimated pl total previous rm guesstimate current pr lift x x x x n current estimated rm weight training sporadically strongest recently senior year high school gym class total probably higher listed previous total table weight lb experiment powerlifting stronglifts x program beginning august felt stagnated quickly motivation left progress new year resolution try seriously build strength opposed lifting aesthetic purpose picked nsuns day program program involves progression main lift tabulated deload set following set secondary lift sumo squat accessory fit attendance rocky initially weak make consistent progress clear progression proved addictive soon attendance improved stalling ohp included accessory lift day program caused switch nsuns day program april day ohp main lift worked tried continue accessory work august dropped entirely unless injured diet literally probably calorie day average usually try good protein barely tracked macro injury don t let injury stop going gym change focus week fall didn t bench press believe elbow tendinitis week didn t ohp rear delt rotator cuff felt tight stopped doing weighted pull ups elbow pain injury severe mindful aggravating lighter cable dumbbell exercise delt raise cable fly tricep extension felt injured supplement equipment lift pair busted van low added belt squat deadlift late august didn t feel difference deadlift squat feel stable hole think improvement lifting form probably contributed total belt supplement creatine g day multivitamin preworkout protein powder creatine protein powder don t taking anymore pretty consistent summer sleep despite senior year engineering student try usually succeed getting hr sleep weekday weekend despite classwork grad school apps say average hr future plan powerlifting club campus likely compete charity meet semester like achieve estimated rms gym improve planning testing week final got way expected succeed squatting failed m just short goal year total like total time year feel stagnating optimistic achieving goal d like cut body fat year don t really care super big planning stay kg compete division usapl future shot right past weight

James Krieger of Weightology (and recent [BF% post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/e4fldb/this_is_a_great_series_by_james_krieger_on/)) just released his ""Volume Bible"" on hypertrophy training.  

We've probably all heard ""[volume drives gains](https://i.imgur.com/7bOp283.jpg)"" a lot recently, and here, Dr. Krieger provides a thorough assessment of the evidence to suggest the best way to manipulate volume when training for size.  Mike Israetel has stated several times that Krieger's Volume Bible informs Renaissance Periodization's [Hypertrophy Training guidelines](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/hypertrophy-training-guide-central-hub/).  It's a beefy write-up to sink your teeth in, but the key takeways and tl;dr are upfront:

&gt;**TL;DR Version**

&gt;* On average, muscle growth tends to be best with around 8 sets per muscle group per training session in trained individuals. Frequency can be used to manipulate weekly volume.
&gt;* Individual results may vary widely from the average.
&gt;* 2-3 sets per muscle group per training session is sufficient for beginners.

1328,Fitness,0,"25M, 6', 147lbs (66,7kg) -&gt; 174lbs (79kg), 10 months of progress with pics. Before &amp; after pics - https://imgur.com/a/eJ0Cqcp

I was always very skinny and I thought I can't eat enough to gain any significant weight, but I learned a lot about nutrition in the last 2 years and I was able to make pretty big improvement. However, some of the gains that were supposed to get absorbed by legs went to my beard instead.

I did gain muscle quite fast partially because I used to lift in the past (in my room with dumbells...) and used to weight about 72kg when I was 21, but after stopping I dropped back to 66,7kg (always was between 66-68kg). Thank you muscle memory.

---

**Diet**

Plenty of non-processed foods that are also rich in calories. About 1.5g protein/kg. I eat the same things over and over again, never grow tired of them thankfully.


Breakfast:

* Oatmeal, a lot of it (300g oats + 300ml milk) + banana + dark chocolate

* Greek yoghurt + banana + sunflower seeds

* Handful of walnuts
 
Lunch:

* Vegetable smoothie (kale, spinach, banana, frozen fruits, berries, lineseed for calories)

* Handful of pumpkin seeds

* 1-2 cans of sardines

Dinner:

* 300g chicken breast

* 100g cooked rice

* 240g cooked red kidney beans

* Frozen vegetables (green peas, carrots, corn, etc.)

* Nuts/ seeds

Supplements:

* Creatine powder
* Vitamin D3 + K2
* Hydrolized collagen powder

Sometimes I would eat something different alongside those. All I drink is tap water and black coffee without sugar twice a week.

If I travel and can't eat as much I still do by having nuts/seeds with me at all times which isn't difficult at all. Seriously just get seeds/ nuts they are healthy af and have a lot of calories.

---
**Workout routine**

First 6-7 months I was doing 5x5 Stronglifts slightly modified with Jeff's from Athlean X reccomendations (I swapped some risky excercises with those that made more sense, don't want to get injured).

I never cared about how much I can bench press, lift or squat as long as I was getting bigger. Currently all of those are somewhere between 70-80kg (154-176lbs). After I stopped getting bigger I switched to PPL and went to gym 4-6 times/ week during the last couple months. I prefer workout total volume over lots of weight. I find it easier to maintain proper form and I don't see a point in being stronger than I currently am. I am a pussy anyway and can't fight so what's the point (I bought some pepper spray).

When I'm at the gym I'm usually more preocuppied with Joe Rogan podcast I'm listening to that applying myself to working out extremely hard. Except for the leg day I don't even sweat that much to be honest. If I see my progress stopping I will consider looking into it. 

However, out of all the components I feel like it's far more important to have proper diet &amp; sleep and just be consistent with working out without worrying about the details too much. I'm just being careful not to injure myself.

---
**Sleep**

I get at least 8 hours of sleep each night. This is extremely important for me and for my wellbeing, helps a lot with gains as well. Watch dr. Matthew Walker on Joe Rogan podcast if you want to learn more about why sleep is crucial for human health.

---

**Going forward**

I might want to go lower on workout volume when it comes to my legs since they grow noticeably slower then my upper body and I read they might need more time to recover, so it might be more efficient to train them once a week instead of twice I guess. Calves refuse to grow, but my lower legs have been just bones my entire life. This doesn't bother me too much and since I got in shape I'm getting a lot of compliments and was able to find a girlfriend hence no masturbation lotion in the second picture, lol.

1329,Fitness,0,"Is it normal that my booty gains come so slowly? [Aug 2019 - Dec 2019](https://imgur.com/6prYFgC) 


I’ve been lifting and bulking to gain a booty for 4 months. I do glutes 2-3 times a week, consisting of activation exercises, barbell squat, sumo deadlift, cable pull through, cable kick back, hip abduction, hip thrust and barbell lunge, alternating them on different days. I’ve been bulking on a 300-500 caloric surplus and increasing at that rate every month, consuming 130-150g of protein everyday. I gained 2kg from 49 to 51 (112lbs) and 2cm of butt (almost an inch). Even though I gained considerably in strength (squatting and deadlifting my body weight, hip thrusting almost double) I don’t see much difference in size, however I do notice that it’s much more lifted. There are those girls that do 100 bodyweight squats or 100 glute bridges everyday for a month and gain 1 inch of butt so easily. Is it normal for booty gains to come this slowly or do I just have shitty genetics?

1330,Fitness,0,"Intense fatigue from working out? Hi everyone,

I started weight training regularly a couple of months ago. My routine consists of 4-5 days of exercise a week: one day for chest/shoulders/triceps, one day for biceps/back, one day for glutes/hams, one day for quads. I also try to add an extra day in for yoga or cardio if my schedule allows for it and if I'm feeling up to it. 

Lately the day after an intense workout (I have been increasing weights/reps every week), I have been feeling completely fatigued and wiped out. Not just ""man I could really use a nap"" or ""I need a little extra caffeine this morning"". It was so bad on Monday that I asked my boss if I could leave work early- I just couldn't function. It's like my energy levels are totally depleted.

I have been trying my best to fuel my body before my workouts (protein bar, rice cakes, jerky) and eat a big post-workout meal (typically sauteed sweet potatoes and veggies with a turkey burger or something with similar macro ratio). Has anyone ever felt the same way and if so, any suggestions on how to get past this?

1331,Fitness,0,"Advice on choosing a new program? Background:

Hi! This is my first time venturing into this subreddit, and I tried to read everything I could before posting. I’ve been lifting for 4 years now, but really only trying for a solid 2. Started out making my own workouts based on high school classes, friend advice, and now I’ve been following a subscription based program for a year (called the daily sculpt if anyone knows it). I’m 5’7”, 23yr old female, started out a 125lb weakling, now at 155lbs but not nearly as strong as I wished. Currently working out 4-5 days/wk trying to bulk by eating ~2200cal with ~140g being protein. Muscle growth is my main goal, strength is an added secondary goal/benefit (as I know they should theoretically go hand-in-hand).

After gaining 10lbs in 4 months I decided to do an InBody scan (considered 98% accurate compared to DEXA) to see how much muscle I gained. It was an extremely disappointing result of .2lbs of muscle and 2% body fat. I thought I had been doing good because I was feeling strong, increasing my weights in my lifts, and only moderately sore (thought I was really pushing myself and recovering well). Well, now I am trying to figure out where I fell short and if I should I continue this program, or should I try something new? I don’t even know what type of program to go for, there are so many on the wiki. I love my current one because it’s 100% planned out every day, it has a good amount of variety month to month, and I can be in and out of the gym in 1 hour (I have long work days and not much free time). I would really appreciate advice on a good program for trying to get bigger (in a time constraint), or constructive criticism, and if you read all of this, thank you!",advice choosing new program background hi time venturing subreddit tried read posting lifting year really trying solid started making workout based high school class friend advice following subscription based program year called daily sculpt know m yr old female started lb weakling lb nearly strong wished currently working day wk trying bulk eating cal g protein muscle growth main goal strength added secondary goal benefit know theoretically hand hand gaining lb month decided inbody scan considered accurate compared dexa muscle gained extremely disappointing result lb muscle body fat thought doing good feeling strong increasing weight lift moderately sore thought really pushing recovering trying figure fell short continue program try new don t know type program wiki love current s planned day good variety month month gym hour long work day free time really appreciate advice good program trying bigger time constraint constructive criticism read thank
1332,Fitness,0,"Is the Hyperextension Machine a bad idea to use the day before deadlifting? Hey everyone,

I run my weird variation of the BBB 531 program where one day I focus on Arm accessories, the next is chest and back, the last 2 days are legs and core. I do a 4 day split, 2 rest days between my leg/core days. I guess this is called the “antagonist” approach.

I thought about incorporating that in today, but then remembered that I am going to be doing my main compound lift of deadlifting tomorrow, and then 2 3 days later I’ll be doing my volume lift of deadlifts again.

1336,Fitness,0,"Both Athlean and Nippard released videos emphasizing Intensity&gt;Volume, How does this relate to strength training while doing high intensity full-body cardio? [Athlean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgGwA5Jm-Ig) and [Jeff Nippard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mja2fDwYA5s&amp;t=136s) released videos discussing and showing how high volume and lower intensity is killing ""gainz"". They both emphasize that high volume is not a substitute for intensity.   So the first question I have is, do the ""Gainz"" they talk about, refer specifically to hypertrophy, size, and aesthetics, or to strength and performance? And if not one, then how does it effect the other?



This got me wondering how this concept would relate to weight training as an ancillary work out to a primary, full body, cardio workout. Examples of the cardio I am referring to would be intense swim routines for 2 hours, rowing and being a part of crew, or maybe boxing for several hours; and then doing your strength training routine. The cardio would provide a significant amount of volume and intensity, but how do you factor that in to your additional weight training? Would the cardio part even be factor for your weight training volume/intensity? Would straight cardio (like long distance running) be a factor in the volume/intensity?

1339,Fitness,0,"Stalling on GZCLP while on a cut, should I switch programs? I've been running the GZCLP program for a long time, even before the cut when I was more or less eating at maintenance.  I'm on a -500cal deficit at the moment as I want to get rid of excess fat around my belly and love handles first (skinny fat curse), with a long term goal of putting on some lean muscle from a lower BF%. My end weight will be 140lbs, I'm pretty much there, just another 2 or 3 lbs slowly and will be done by mid January. From there I'll look to do maintenence for a few weeks then +500 surplus and bulk from there. 

As of today my T1 and 2 lifts are as follows before stalling on the recommended progression (I use kg but have converted to lbs to make it easier) -

Bench - 150lbs (T1) 125lbs (T2)

OHP - 110lbs (T1) 100lbs (T2)

Deadlift - 255lbs (T1) 185lbs (T2)

Squat - 210 (T1) 145lbs (T2)

1342,Fitness,0,"Fitness Evaluation Machine at the Gym So every year the gym requires us to come in for a fitness eval for insurance purposes. Part of the eval is to lay down while they stick 2 electrodes to us: one on the right hand, and one on the right foot. This measures our body fat %, our muscle % (I don't know if that's the right term), and some metabolism measurement. They will then compare our numbers to the last time we did it. It also comes up with graphs and stuff. 

Normally the result is they basically tell you you're fat, and you'd benefit from a personal trainer. My girlfriend and I did it together one time and our graphs looked identical but the numbers were different.

1346,Fitness,0,"35M, 6', 132lb -&gt; 168lb. 15 months of progress and questions Before: [https://imgur.com/82vxTlS](https://imgur.com/82vxTlS)

After: [https://imgur.com/9zeOI15](https://imgur.com/9zeOI15)

I was always known as the skinny one growing up, and used to wear it as a badge of pride. My friends and family would be so envious that I was so skinny and wondered how I did it (Ans: I just wasn't eating enough). I was inspired to start after reading a Nytimes article citing a study that we perceive our future selves as total strangers and this makes us make bad future decisions. I decided to help ""Future Me"" and decided to start exercising.

I initially hired a PT as I thought it would help with forcing me into the gym. After six sessions, I felt that I was just doing random exercises and thought it was a rather expensive waste of time. I felt motivated enough to go to the gym on my own already and I didn't need a PT for motivation. I went to reddit and found r/fitness. It was there that I seriously learnt about diet and exercise.

**Diet**

Based on a TDEE calculator, I try to hit about 2400 calories a day.

* Breakfast: I used to always skip my breakfast and still hate eating it. I drink my breakfast everyday. The shake is 400ml milk, 3/4 cup oats, 1 scoop protein, 2 teaspoons chia seeds and 1 tablespoon olive oil \[Around 800 calories\]
* Lunch and dinner: I entertain clients for a living and many meetings are over meals. Its difficult to track my calories, but I try to ensure I hit my protein goal of 150g a day
* Supper: I usually force myself to eat a small supper. Usually instant noodles and a can of tuna
* Supplements: 3g creatine a day
* Alcohol: This is a big struggle for me. I think about 4-6 shots of whisky a night (its a habit)

Based on my tracking, I gained about 27lb in the first 7 months (this was not a good idea, and I definitely gained more fat than I should have), and about 9lb in the other 6 months. My weight gain has slowed considerably and it has been a struggle to force myself to eat (see reason below)

**Exercise**

I started about with reddit's 6-day PPL at my apartment gym which doesn't have a barbell. This meant that I couldn't do the main compound lifts at all. Being as weak as I was, this worked for about 8 months until I thought that I \*really\* needed to find a real gym with a barbell. I then joined a gym and started on 5/3/1 BBB. My current 1RM (calculated, not tested) are:

Bench: 205lb

Military press: 135lb

Deadlift: 270lb

Squat: 200lb (I am terrible at squatting)

My accessories are simple: Chinups (bodyweight or weighted; 5x3x15kg or 5x5x10kg) superset with the BBB sets, 3x12 seated machine rows, 3x12 cable crossovers, 5x5 bench press, 3x15  facepulls, 3x25 hammer curls and 3x15 sets leg raises/ab wheel.

Conditioning: 2 days of light conditioning at the elliptical, 30 mins @ 130-140 bpm

**Progress**

All my family members and friends have told me that I look much better. Looking at my old photos, I am shocked at how skinny I was. I know my family really loves me because they really never cared how I looked lol. I even get compliments from some colleagues that I'm busting out of my work shirts (I need to tailor new shirts). It has been a great confidence boost and I know I'm on the right track.

**Questions**

At 6', 168 lb still feels skinny for me. (My target weight is around 185 lb) I can still see a bit of my collar bones and rib cage sticking out. I feel that my pecs are developing well (my wife tells me they are nice and hard). But I can't help but feel terrible that I'm developing a belly. From a side profile, my pecs and belly are about level. As a person who has identified with being skinny all my life, having a big belly weighs on my mind all the time. My question: Do I cut for a spell and get that belly down before bulking again; or do I continue to bulk given that I'm still small? Or is this all in my head? What bodyfat% am I at?

A big thanks to everyone in this sub, I've learnt so much and will definitely keep going.

1351,Fitness,0,"A question on calories i need to be clarified on Hey, ive had a question recently thats been bugging me lately. We all know the equation calories in/calories out (eat at a calorie deficit to lose weight, or a calorie surplus to gain weight) but what if i go into the negative calories burned? This may seem like a stupid question for some of you people but please bare with me lol. If i wake up and have a breakfast containing 800 calories, but then go to the gym right after and burn 900 calories that will leave me with -100 calories. Is this a bad thing? (Sorry if this was worded weirdly and is confusing)


I was also wondering which time of day to go to the gym is better. 

Hypothetically speaking, if someone needed 2000 calories to maintain their weight, but that person has decided to give themselves a calorie deficit of 500, should they get all of their meals out of the way first, making sure they reach that 2000 calorie body weight maintenance quota, and then go to the gym and burn 500 calories? Lets say i wake up and have an 800 calorie breakfast and burn whatever amount of calories at the gym (for this example lets say 700 leaving me with 100 calories left in the bank). Should i eat 1400 calories throughout the day to reach a maximum of 1500 calories? (because in this scenario i have a body maintenance need of 2000 calories per day and want to create a deficit)


In other words: should i get all of my meals out of the way and create a calorie deficit by working out? Does it matter if i wake up, have breakfast, go to the gym and eat back my calories spent to reach a total of 1500 calories? Is it bad to go into negative calories (800 calories consumed, 900 calories burned). 

Again, sorry if this question seems stupid and sounds like it was written by an idiot.

1352,Fitness,0,"Food tracker calorie to macro accuracy issues  So recently I've been noticing that I can hit my macro goals while being way under on kcals according to Cronometer. I'm going to focus specifically on the macro targets for now because the research I've done it isn't possible to be below on calories if I meet my macros and is telling me to base the calories off of that (i.e. 4p/4c/9f). I'm a little bummed though because I tried to be as accurate as possible by searching for the right brands and even weigh/measure a lot of items like fruits, veggies, condiments and meat.

I'm worried though that the items I'm finding in my searches aren't accurate or that if I do something like select a 2tbsp serving and enter the serving amount as 0.5 it is screwing up the calculator. So I have two questions. 1.) Is there a proven accurate/reliable food tracker app or 2.) anywhere I can find a source of absolute truth on macro content of a given item? Or is that not possible at all due to unavoidable biological fluctuations in things? Like two chickens from the same farm, same age, same diet could have totally different fat/protein content in the meat.

1358,Fitness,0,"Need advice from experienced people. HELP So let’s say I’m working my chest. I have a good program that I follow and each full workout consisted of 6 sets lasts a certain time of minutes. It isn’t long but quite hard and asks a 100% effort, at least for me it’s like that. 

I like that cause I prefer more extreme but shorter portioned workouts. 

So I complete it once with great form but want to do it twice to get that extra pump and just go hard since I do a 5 day split and it seems like a good idea to go a bit harder than I would have if I worked on it more times a week. 

The problem is, on the second time I go, I already star failing at the first reps and even if I push through, my chest gives out and I do these weird, heavy shoulder assisted push ups which don’t really work but just mess up my shoulder day. 

My question is, does this mean that the workout is effective to be done only once and I should wait and not do it twice until my chest has developed well enough to take it on twice on the same day? 

Of course, I could wait 20 mins to recover and then do it again pretty decently. But if I had that much time, I’d do an easier workout but for 50mins instead. 

I do get great results with my current one and I feel the soreness the other day and I get a good pump in the moment.

My BMI right now is like 26.1, so I'm slightly overweight with very little muscle left over from my high school days.  I'd prefer not to be gaining weight, as this feels like a step in the wrong direction.

Last, I hate other forms of cardio and don't have a access to a pool until the 16th of January.  Is it really dumb to lift without significant Cardio?  

One extra question if anybody gets a chance.  How do I find a good starting weight?

1363,Fitness,0,"Walking for cardio... goals? For those of you who walk for your cardio. What kind of goals/programming do you set? Do you step out with a set distance in mind or is it time based? Do you pay attention to your pace (like a runner) or focus more on your heart rate/feeling? Is there progression built in to your walking?

Currently, I set out to walk 2 miles, as fast as I can, without jogging or ""power walking"". At roughly 13:30/mile, it takes just under 30 mins. I do this Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri and a 5 miler (or a hike) on Saturday or Sunday (schedule dependant). I also lift (pretty much a PHUL 4-day program).

TLDR - do you walkers treat walking how runners treat running? If so, how do you program? If not, what's your program?

EDIT: I live in Southern California, so I walk outside. I have a hill about a mile from my front door so I work that in as well. I would only walk the treadmill if it was raining (rare).

1378,Fitness,0,"Good idea to temporarily take up trail running instead of weightlifting? Hey all. First post on this sub so please be gentle. 

For the first time in my life, I've been consistently hitting the gym/weights. I'd say it's been like that for the past 4-5 months. I mostly do full body workouts mixed in with some heavy weight lifts and some Hiit. 

The bad news is that I'm going back home for the holidays. Why is that bad? Because there isn't a gym nearby and I'll be there for two weeks. 

We are about 5 minutes away from some really nice trail running trails however, so I was thinking of hitting those decently hard for these two weeks and do some longer runs. Maybe something like 2-3 five mile runs each week mixed in with some abs. 

I was wondering if this would be a good alternative, or should I do something else, like some hill sprints or something? Should I do more or less miles, and how much more protein should I be eating to prevent muscle loss? Any other misc. advice or ideas?

For the record, I'm familiar with these trails, and I was an on again off again runner before taking up weights. 

Thanks for any help.

1382,Fitness,0,"Is Lifting Weights Bad for Joint Health? I have a history as a D1 athlete that was extremely informed about lifting weights and health about 6 years ago. I’m embarrassed to admit I did not keep up with this stuff and don’t know what new research is, so I have a few questions. 

1. My good friend won’t lift weights because he claims, “he wants to have joints in his 80s.”  Is lifting with proper form bad for joint health? I have very good squat form and do get sore knees, but maybe the soreness is due to something else? Any studies or science behind your answer would be huge. I have found conflicting reports and would love to learn more for myself and be able to explain it to my friend. 

2. TLDR: I took a month off from the gym and ate at maintenance. Got back in the gym and went from 60lb dumbbell bench to 75 lb dumbbell bench. All of my other lifts increased significantly as well. Any explanation?

I’ve lost 40 pounds still have another 40 to go to get back to my ideal physique that I once had. That said, I had not lifted for 2 years before starting up again and lifted sporadically for three month periods when I did lift. I probably hadn’t lifted seriously for more than 5 months at a time for 5 years. So I started lifting in late September through October. For example, I started benching the 50lb dumbbells and got up to the 60 lb dumbbells before taking all of November off. I didn’t lose weight or gain weight in November. I am at a 1500 caloric deficit and still maintaining these gains going into week three. The weird thing is, for example, I never lifted more than 100 lb dumbbells for bench, so I am significantly on my way to getting back there. Does anyone have any explanation for why I was able to gain on my lifts like this? I have looked online and can’t find anything conclusive... did I also gain muscle mass during my time away too?

1393,Fitness,0,"18M 5'11"" 128lbs --&gt; 175lbs 1.3y Progress  

Background:

Winter 2017 I started to work out. It never really got too serious though, since I had no real drive, and the trainer at my school wasn't good. I stopped once track season started, and I didn't care too much.

That spring, in April 2018, I had what started the most difficult life experience to date. My first girlfriend, who I had been with for 11 months dumped me. I don't need to go in much detail, but it was shitty as hell, and I ended up dropping a few pounds, going to 125lbs.

I was filled with sadness, insecurity, and anger. One of my closest friends, who happens to know his stuff about working out, wanted to be my personal trainer. He wants to pursue a future as one, and I trusted him, so I obliged.

This was in July. I hadn't started eating right at this point, I was really just getting a routine down, and figuring out how to work out. No real progress was made, just figuring out my starting points for various exercises.

When I actually started:

In mid September 2018, I was ready. I started meal prepping and planning my meals. I'll never forget the first day I consumed 3,000 calories. I had never eaten so much in my life, I was constantly about to burst. It was honestly more difficult than working out, and I came incredibly close to throwing up that night.

Slowly, it became easier. I'd have days where I didn't meet the goal caloric intake, but I'd slowly make it more and more frequently.

After about a month I started to see some weight gain. I started to take creatine, and protein powder for protein shakes.

I continued eating as much as I could and consuming protein shakes after every workout, and I was making noticeable progress. I'd record my weight for different dates in a Google spreadsheet, and connect it to a chart and see a general upward trend. I made the goal of reaching 150lbs. Once I reached it, I'd buy myself a shirt and make a cutoff out of it.

I reached 150 in February 2019. Around late november 2018 to January 2019, I didnt make much progress. I got sick, attended my brother's graduation, got sick again. Really, I just wasn't able to work out for at least 2 weeks consistently during this time.

From Feb 2019 to June 2019, I went from 150 to 168 pounds. After making little progress from November 2018 -Jan 2019, I buckled down and went for it again. Made some good progress. 

June to July 2019, I started a cut. I wasn't really fat, but I figured I'd cut a bit off so I can have a good starting place for my next bulk. I did it for 4 weeks, and ended up taking a break from working out because I mentally exhausted myself. I decreased my volume with my caloric intake, but for some reason going to the gym really stressed me out. During my week long break, I concluded that I should go back to bulking up, because I wasn't really fat to start anyway. I wanted to just go all in and bulk until I was legitimately getting fat. Although, I will say I lost 4-5 lbs while I was cutting and a few lifts actually improved, so I'll consider it a minor success.

July to December 2019, I started my new bulking routine, and switched to my college gym (first semester). Went from 163 to 175 (current). July to late august, I worked out as frequently as I should have. Once I started college, however, it took a while until I started going consistently. I had to figure out how my daily schedule would work, how to get the calories in, etc. Mid october I started going consistently

Results, as of now:

Right now I think I look great. Im at my biggest, and I feel strong. I am getting a little fat, but I think I can continue bulking until the summer. After writing this, I'm going to the gym and starting a new routine.

&amp;#x200B;

Diet:

From Fall 2018 to Summer 2019, I'd wake up and eat a bowl of quaker banana nut oatmeal, cup of milk, banana, and package of belvita. I'd then get 3 lunches at school (none if I was meal prepping chicken and rice). After my workout, Id make a protein shake at home, then eat dinner (varied). Through the evening I'd drink more whole milk and eat belvita

Summer 2019, I'd still have the belvita oatmeal, banana and milk breakfast. Lunch would usually be a lean cuisine frozen meal, milk, belvita, and a banana. I'd workout around noon and go to work right after, where I'd have dinner (varied) and several cups of chocolate milk. When I got home at night, Id put some goya flavored rice in my rice cooker (great investment, highly recommend) and have a small protein shake.

Fall 2019 - December 2019, I'd eat approx 1200 calories at breakfast lunch and dinner at my college dining hall. I'd have 3 cups of while milk at every meal. Breakfast was usually 250 cal in eggs, 200 cal in yogurt, 450 cal in whole milk (It was rare for me to get 1200 cal for breakfast). Lunch and dinner varied a lot, but every friday I'd get a 32oz strawberry hulk with 2 servings of almond butter and 1 serving of protein at smoothie king. Id also get this if there was nothing good at the dining hall.

Lift progress:

(no belts)

Bench -  8x65lb -&gt; 8x150lb

Squat - 8x80lbs -&gt; 8x215lb

Chin ups - 5x127lb -&gt; 6x175lb

1395,Fitness,0,"Lifting weights and eating at a deficit feels exhausting and unsustainable. So  I'm eating around 1400 - 1600 calories a day, and trying to keep  protein at about 110 to 130 grams. (f) 5'4 - 143lbs. I've heard it's  best to keep lifting even while losing weight and just eat enough  protein to maintain muscle mass. Problem is that I feel so weak and  every workout is just me struggling mentally and physically to the point  I'd just rather not do it at all.

At  this point I'm starting to think I should just stop lifting altogether  while losing the weight and then try and bulk up once I reach my goal.  But I know that seeing what little muscle I have waste away is going to  suck and it will take longer/ be worse for my body recomp.

I  guess I'm just asking for advice on what I should do/ what might be the  best option for me that could be more sustainable? Has anyone faced  this same issue?

Thanks for the help.


Edit: Thank you to everyone who replied, I've gotten some good advice. First thing I'm going to try is caffeine or a creatine supplement before my next workout to see if that helps me feel more fueled. If not then I will try upping my carbs and eating an hour or so prior to going to the gym. If I'm still feeling drained then I will up my calories by a couple hundred. I won't stop lifting, thanks everyone!

Edit #2: I’ve woken up to some great advice, thanks again everyone for commenting.

Others have suggested I get my iron levels and d3 checked. As well as upping my carb intake and having more complex carbs rather than the mostly fruit I have been having.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: It's been such a weird decade for me in terms of fitness. In 2010 I was 153kg (337lbs) and was unable to walk 500m without being puffed, and just five years later I was 90kg (198lbs(  and able to run 3km in 12 minutes. However, within the next three years, I fell back into my old habits which would cause my weight to skyrocket back up to 133kg. Honestly, this was due to a whole lot of laziness and just way too much pizza. However,  in December last year, I decided that enough was enough. I started cutting the toxic food out of my life and begun to exercise again. 

What I did: I began walking pretty much every day. I would walk up to 15km some days, with a minimum of 10km on the others. I also started playing social basketball once a week again. Eventually, I built up the courage to start running again around December of last year. To be honest, although I was exercising a lot it wasn't until July of this year where things really started to pick-up. I joined the gym and decided that for the first time in my life I was going to seriously attempt weightlifting. In the past, I had dabbled with it, but I had never consistently gone or attempted to improve. This was a massive reality check for me. I never knew how weak I was. I mean, imagine being 125kg and barely able to bench the barbell. I started going 3x a week doing a full-body split. I became addicted to the gym super quick and realized that 3x a week was not going to be enough for me to be fulfilled. Therefore, I started doing a PPLPPL split. 

&amp;#x200B;

Weightlifting:

To give you an idea of how my lifts have improved:

BP  

July - 1RM - 30kg (66lbs)

Now - 1RM - 75kg  (165lbs)


DL  

July - 1RM - 60kg  

Now - Something around 120kg probs - I'll try it today.

  
OHP

July - 1RM - 20kg (45lbs)

Now - 1RM - 45kg (90lbs)

&amp;#x200B;

(I've only just started squatting yesterday - I had to get a PT to help me with form because I have terrible ankle flexability due to basketball injuries) 

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/125fwwCUj8jvMH5cPXGqGDIVL-ohNQQaH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/125fwwCUj8jvMH5cPXGqGDIVL-ohNQQaH/view?usp=sharing) \- here's my workout. It's worth mentioning that on the second pull day I substitute an exercise for DL which is 10x1 @ 50kg 10x1@80kg 5x2@100kg 3x3@110kg. On the second push day, I substitute an exercise for dips/lateral raises. 

These are my future goals:

  
\- 100kg (225lbs) Bench  
\- 60kg (132lbs) OHP  
\-150kg (330lbs) Squat  
\-180kg (390lbs) DL (Currently at 110 (242lbs) kgx3)  
\-More generally muscular appearance, but not super crazy.  
\-Lose 15kg

I'd take any feedback you have to give regarding my workouts so that I can achieve these goals. I also want to add core somewhere because I know it's important I just haven't done it yet.

Cardio:

I will run at least three times a week at a mid-high intensity, and I test my (theoretical) Vo2 max every two or three weeks by the 12 min run on a treadmill. I will also cycle on the exercise bikes every couple of days. I also play social basketball two times a week now (although both seasons have just finished and will start up soon),

Goals: 

Sub 5-minute kilometer 

Long term goals:

3km 12 minute run. 

Diet:

I don't count calories and macros that religiously. I know this is probably frowned upon - but I've tried using MyFitnessPal - and I kinda just forget. However, I try to stick under 2300 calories (I obviously also try to have a high protein intake so that I can somewhat lose fat and gain muscle - it's worked so far). I don't take protein powders or any pre-workouts aside from Creatine and I've only been doing that for a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion - I hope that I can achieve my goals and live healthier for the next decade. I'm not getting any younger so it's important that I stay healthy and achieve these goals while I can.",m cm kg m cm kg edit m lb m lb don t picture shirt loose skin weight loss face gain started losing weight drive google file d ciima bmml \_ x s gsmlak y wze view usp sharing drive google file d ciima bmml _ x s gsmlak y wze view usp sharing gym gain drive google file d qe zrun lbtkxl mr nqnkhhyrnjys view usp sharing drive google file d qe zrun lbtkxl mr nqnkhhyrnjys view usp sharing cardio gain drive google file d \_ashdfhyuma wt d ylinm h ziuzgbv view usp sharing drive google file d _ashdfhyuma wt d ylinm h ziuzgbv view usp sharing bonus original weightloss drive google file d q jozbbblxc cvdyuoslogxgawizmd view usp sharing drive google file d q jozbbblxc cvdyuoslogxgawizmd view usp sharing background s weird decade term kg lb unable walk m puffed just year later kg lb able run km minute year fell old habit cause weight skyrocket kg honestly lot laziness just way pizza december year decided started cutting toxic food life begun exercise did began walking pretty day walk km day minimum km started playing social basketball week eventually built courage start running december year honest exercising lot wasn t july year thing really started pick joined gym decided time life going seriously attempt weightlifting past dabbled consistently gone attempted improve massive reality check knew weak mean imagine kg barely able bench barbell started going x week doing body split addicted gym super quick realized x week going fulfilled started doing pplppl split weightlifting idea lift improved bp july rm kg lb rm kg lb dl july rm kg kg probs ll try today ohp july rm kg lb rm kg lb just started squatting yesterday pt help form terrible ankle flexability basketball injury drive google file d fwwcuj jvmh cpxgqgdivl ohnqqah view usp sharing drive google file d fwwcuj jvmh cpxgqgdivl ohnqqah view usp sharing \ s workout s worth mentioning second pull day substitute exercise dl x kg x kg x kg x kg second push day substitute exercise dip lateral raise future goal \ kg lb bench \ kg lb ohp \ kg lb squat \ kg lb dl currently lb kgx \ generally muscular appearance super crazy \ lose kg d feedback regarding workout achieve goal want add core know s important just haven t cardio run time week mid high intensity test theoretical vo max week min run treadmill cycle exercise bike couple day play social basketball time week season just finished start soon goal sub minute kilometer long term goal km minute run diet don t count calorie macro religiously know probably frowned tried using myfitnesspal kinda just forget try stick calorie obviously try high protein intake somewhat lose fat gain muscle s worked far don t protein powder pre workout aside creatine doing week conclusion hope achieve goal live healthier decade m getting younger s important stay healthy achieve goal

1418,Fitness,0,"Breathing While Running vs Biking I've been running semi consistently for a year and a half or two years now. Almost immediately it was obvious to me how important breathing in rhythm with my running was. As I got better at it and didn't have to actively think about it quite as much, the distances that I could run started going up and I generally just enjoyed running more. 

Recently, I've started using a recumbent bike in between runs as a way to try to continue working on my endurance but with less stress on my legs/joints. I knew going in that I'd have to find a similar rhythm between my breathing and pedaling BUT damn it, if I'm not having a hell of a time!

I ride for about 30 minutes at a time usually between 12 and 16 mph. It seems like I can't find a rhythm until I'm already nearly out of breath. I don't know if maybe I'm just starting out too fast. It just doesn't feel that fast.

1421,Fitness,0,"The benefits of high-intensity failure? I work with a personal trainer who makes me laugh at the crazy shit he comes up for me to do. Here's the difference between how I might have worked out before him, and how he makes me work:

Me: Knee pushups, 3 sets of 20 (I weigh 330 pounds), then 2 sets of regular pushups, I can do maybe 12 and then 10.

Him: Put on a *weight vest*, superset another exercise with pushups, and *never* resort to knee pushups, even when I'm reduced to looking like a spastic trying to get one more 1/4 of a pushup out as he yells ""explode!"" at me. 

Me: Do a typical barbell squat routine: Warmup set, 1 set of 12 , 1 set of 8, 3 sets of 5, increasing weight. Minute rest in between each set.

Him: Barbell squats with a pause mid-squat, up and down. Only 15 seconds rest between sets, and go for 20reps. If you just can't do 20, rack the bar, but pick it up and get those remaining reps out ASAP, no matter what.

Me: Planks, 3 sets, one minute.

Him: Planks are way too easy. Try this version of the plank you can only do for 3 seconds at the time, but keep trying to get back into it.

Me: 20 minutes on the treadmill, fast walk, alternating 90sec 8-degree incline with 90sec no incline, then a sprint at the end for however long I can.

Him: Put the treadmill at sprint, *max* incline, 20 second bursts, jumping on and off, as little rest in between bursts as possible. I did mention I weigh 330 pounds, so this 100% output for me, and I can't do it for very long.

For other runners out there, what are some specific training programs you follow pre-post-during season that help you become a more well rounded athlete and maintain (or increase) your strength?

I travel frequently for business so plans more focused around kettlebells/sandbags/rucks may be more applicable at the current point of my life.

1425,Fitness,0,"Would reverse pyramid training on compound lifts make me less explosive So genetically I am pretty explosive in my shoulders and punches.  A lot of people told me.  I have been doing 5reps by 3 sets for a couple months on all my compound lifting then switching to high reps on isolations.  5 reps is just right to move the weight as explosive as you can for a short set.    
But there is this workout plan Kinobody does,  it is, do 5 reps your MOST HARDEST SET FIRST.  Then drop the weight by 10percent and try to aim for 2 extra reps.. then another 10percent drop, and try to do 2 more reps before so it would look like.  
5 reps.. 7 or 8.. then 9 or 10.   


But I don't want to change my typeIIB pure explosive fibers and turn them into TypeIIA thus getting less explosive since I already do higher, slowerish reps for isolations like rear delts, middelts, bicep curls. tricep pushdowns.

1437,Fitness,0,"Is it okay if my bench press is comparable to my deadlift? Or is there something very dysfunctional with my routine at the moment. I'm 9 months into lifting where I squatted and benched from the first week while I started deadlifting about 6 months ago.

Weird thing is my deadlift super duper sucks for how heavy I am, significantly worse than I expected it to be at this point. My squat is reasonable but my bench is pretty impressive in comparison.

1RMs:

Bench - 315

Squat - 385

Deadlift - 325

One thing I was reading up on was leverage, with how short arms make deadlifts difficult but make bench in comparison far easier. I have pretty short arms for my height (5'10'', 205 lbs and a 5'8'' reach)  but nothing so outrageous I think that my bench is practically the same as my deadlift?

I know my form is okay because I have consulted a PT for one session to check my DL and bench forms. Well I hope it is and that PT was okay :P Is my routine messed up? I do 3 leg days a fortnight (combining squats and deadlifts on the same days), while I do 5 chest/shoulders days in that time period and 3 back/arm days.

Is combining squat/deadlift on the same day hurting my numbers? Or should I not worry about this and keep pushing with what I have.

&amp;#x200B;

ROUTINE:

1 hour per gym session approximately. Legs = Legs + core, Chest = chest + shoulders or triceps , Back = Back + biceps

&amp;#x200B;

Day 1 - Legs

Day 2 - Chest

Day 3 -  Back

Day 4 - Chest

Day 5 - Rest

Day 8 - Back

Day 9 - Rest

Day 10 - Chest

Day 11 - Legs

Day 12 - Back

Day 13 - Chest

Day 14 - Rest

&amp;#x200B;

Rough routine for each day is similar. 

For chest I do 3 x 6 bench, then 2 sets to failure. then I do the same for incline at a lower weight, then I do overhead press, delt fly, then lat raises, front lat raises then I'm done. On tricep days I still do delt fly but I do tricep extensions instead of the other exercises and I do 7 sets for each bench type instead, the last 2 sets at a lower weight.

For legs i do 3 x 8 for squats, then 2 x 6, then 1 to failure. Then I do 4 x 6 for leg presses, and then 1 to failure. Then I do 5 sets of 5 reps for deadlifts, and 1 set to failure. Lastly I then do 3 sets of hanging leg raises, 2 sets of sit ups on an incline, then 2 more sets of hanging leg raises, and 1 set of situps to failure. 

For back I first do pullups to failure. Then I do 6 sets of lat pulldowns, 3 sets wide grip 3 sets narrow grip, alternating. Then I do the horizontal pull thingy for 5 sets.  Then I do 5 sets of rear delt fly, then I switch the lat pulldown grip to the horizontal pull thingy grip and do that for 4 sets. Then I sometimes do 4 sets of barbell rows for 8 reps and 1 to failure. Usually I spend more time on isolation bicep exercises, starting with barbell curls alternating to hammer curls with dumbbells, 2 sets of wide grip curls, 2 sets of narrow grip, and 4 hammer curl sets.

1438,Fitness,0,"Do those little under-desk cardio machines do anything for calorie burning or is it a waste of time There are mini pedal bikes and elipticals made for people working at a desk. It is meant to be very low intensity, basically used when your mind is not deeply occupied. If you burn an extra 50 cal/hr for 6 hours that would be 300 calories extra for the day.

1440,Fitness,0,"Breathing in the front squat I've been having some trouble breathing in the front squat, and I don't know if it's because my technique is off or my belt is too tight. On my heaviest sets I try to inhale deeply (swelling my belly out, not my chest) just before I unrack the bar. By the time I step back to start squatting I need more air. If I exhale and breathe again I immediately lose stability, and if I try to soldier through and hold my breath through the first rep I sometimes get dizzy, which is obviously dangerous.

1443,Fitness,0,"Efficiency vs. Consistency Starting Out Recently I've been putting more effort into prioritizing my health and building a healthier lifestyle, which naturally includes working out and fitness. Ever since I started college there would be periods of time during which I would go to the gym more frequently (i.e. winter break and summer), but it would be maybe 1-2x per week max and I'd be very inconsistent with the exercises I was doing and effort that I put in. Winter break recently began again and I have made it a goal of mine to stay consistent this time around. For the past couple of weeks I've been doing just that: going to the gym 4-5x a week and doing the same workout routines. However, I am now getting to a point where I'm trying to maximize efficiency and optimize my workouts.

Every workout consists of an hour of cardio (I experimented with a few methods, but settled on the elliptical) during which I usually go anywhere from 5-6.5 miles. Another hour is dedicated to resistance/weight training. I'm very much a noob in this aspect, so I pretty much do full-body workouts every time. I basically do all the workout machines in my gym, including: hip abductor/adductor, leg press, chest press, row, chest fly, lat pulldown, incline press, bicep curl, tricep extension, abdominal/crunch, and back extension. I try to mix up muscle groups so that I don't do all the machines that train the same ones in a row for ex. chest press then hip abductor rather than chest press then fly (not sure if this is actually beneficial). Set/rep range per machine is 2x\~13. I usually don't go to failure, but 13 reps is my max for good form. As an aside, I started off by doing cardio at first but found that it severely limited my resistance training ability. When I started doing weights first I realized I could do better and still have plenty of energy for cardio during the second hour.

As this is the first time I'm actually being consistent with working out, I'm seeing pretty significant gains. My body is becoming more defined, especially around my shoulders and arms. However, I know that this type of progress is likely not sustainable as time goes on and that I will eventually have to know what the hell I'm doing in the gym, lol.

Lastly, I've been looking into the wiki/researching into efficient ways for beginners to work out and it seems that the prevailing notion is that anything that gets beginners in the gym on a consistent basis is good enough. Now that I have that down, however, what are my next steps? My main goal is weight loss, so should I put the brakes on resistance training now until I reach my goal weight? Per the wiki, it says to choose one or the other. If I weren't to give up weight training, should I move to a more efficient/sustainable program, such as PPL? I've only really stuck to machines, so it would be a completely new experience for me to work with barbells/Smith machines/etc. If I did this, would I still have room for cardio and have my main goal still be weight loss?

1450,Fitness,0,"When does the scale number matter? Hello,

Not a native speaker, I apologize for any mistakes. 
I’m a 5’3 woman, working out with weights and resistance bands + incorporating yoga for mobility. I’ve been doing this regularly for 3-4 months now and my body changed drastically. I was not overweight, but I definitely had no muscle composition whatsoever. 

When I first started I weighed 53 kg (117 lbs). I found a scale yesterday the curiosity got the best of me and I saw the number 55.8 (123 lbs). Now _I KNOW_ I put a serious amount of beginners muscle in a short time, but I never actually tracked my weight throughout the process. I will continue to build until I am at a certain body fat percentage (Goal is 17-18%). I have no fear of adding resistance and weight.

Here is my concern: I really don’t know if any point of this process the number of the scale will matter. I don’t care that it raised, but I don’t know what to expect in the future. I am trying to build lean muscle, eating carefully, building my calories back up (used to under eat due to busy schedule).

1452,Fitness,0,"I want to compete Hi everyone !

Going, straight to the point even if I don't know if it is the right subreddit, sorry for that.

Im 24, started lifting like 7 months ago and would like to know if I could compete in natural bodybuilding (men's physique but because of my natural shape probably men's classique) with a year of preparation. Is there an optimal age to start this type of fitness journey ? I feel like Im too old to start competing when I see people who are lifting since 16 years old.

Im 5'8 and went from 154,3 lbs to 190,2 lbs in those 7 months and I must be around 22% fat according to my electronic thingy.

My goal for my bulk is to reach 200 lbs and start cutting for a competition. But I wondered if muscles that worked for just one year and half could compete against muscles that had been trained for years.

1456,Fitness,0,"Training twice a day on Wendler 5/3/1 BBB. Hi 

So I have been following the Wendler 5/3/1 BBB program for a few months now and I decided to recently do cardio in the form of cycling for 30min in the mornings and then do weights in the afternoon. This is my third week training twice day. The first week I felt fine after implementing twice a day but last week I started to feel super tired and sluggish. I wasn't sleeping very well and my body (mostly legs) where sore every morning. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is can the introduction of cardio in the morning mess up my recovery so bad? Because I just came back from my 3 rest days and I am feeling great. But I know by Wednesday I will be feeling like crap.  I was under the impression cardio isn't that strenuous. I have tried to increase my caloric intake but according to my scale in the  mornings I am picking up weight way to fast for my liking. I included my BBB routine and diet below and by the looks of it doesn't look like I am doing to much volume. And IMO I think I should do more.   


**Cardio Routine in the morning:**  
30min on Bike moderate-high intensity  


**5/3/1 BB Routine 4 Days a week**  
5/3/1 (Bench, Squat, OHP, DL)  
5x10 BBB sets (Bench, Squat, OHP, DL)

Incline Dumbbell Press 4x10  
Lat Pull-down/ Pullup 4x10

Bicep Curls 3x10

3 rest days

**Diet**

**Breakfast**

150g Chicken Breast

200g Potatoes

A lot of veggies (broccoli, tomatoes, carrots)

**Lunch**

200g Potatoes/ Sweet Potatoes

A lot of veggies (broccoli, tomatoes, carrots)

**Supper**

5 whole eggs

70g of Rolled Oats

A lot of veggies (broccoli, tomatoes, carrots)

That's mostly what I eat day to day. 

So am I doing to much? Should I lower my frequency of morning cardio and then slowly build up to everyday? Or am I eating to little for recovery?

1466,Fitness,0,"Should I take several days off periodically with rowing machine? Greetings all

I bought a basic rowing machine last year but didn't get very far with it.  I tried doing ten minute work outs figuring I'd increase the time as my endurance increased but basically quit because my endurance didn't go anywhere.  So, about seven weeks ago I realized that I wouldn't build endurance without, you know, enduring something, so I came up with a new plan.  Row for 30 minutes every Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, focusing on form and technique, and doing enough reps to keep my heart up and sweat going.  So I go strong as I feel comfortable backing off to lower intensity until I feel my breath coming easier and going back up.  Doesn't matter if I can only do two strokes a minute I figure I just need to keep going.  Turns out I can average between fifteen to twenty a minute, which I don't think is bad for a flabby out of shape bag of protoplasm in his early midlife.  Once I really have this down I plan to look into more regimented training plans but for right now I know I can stick with something as long as it's simple.

I stuck for it for a week solid, then sprained my ankle on some uneven concrete (which wasn't part of my plan) and took the next three weeks off to heal.  I've been at it for the last three weeks solid and I have to say I love the results.  I have actual mass and definition in my arms, I can walk up a flight of stairs without feeling like I'm going to pass out and my wife says I'm looking slimmer and have a more solid back.  I'm even standing taller and just all around feeling better.  I had to bring in some heavy packages last week and was amazed at how much easier it was.  Damn I love the rowing machine.  If I can make this much progress after a month of training I'm excited to see where I can be in six months or a year.  My only regret is that I didn't start doing this twenty years ago.

Anyway, what I'm wondering is if I should just keep going week after weak or if that will start to be a negative.  I know it's common for people to take recovery periods for several days of lower to no training, is that something I should be doing?

1479,Fitness,0,"Bulking, Heart Rate, and Sleep (Earlier post was removed, but honestly, I can't find a past thread that discusses the details I'm hoping to learn about...)

I've been using a heart rate tracking watch for the last year. While cutting this past summer, my overnight BPM averaged 42-45 bpm. Since bulking \~2 weeks ago, this has increased to 55-57bpm. A sleep tracking app (which has been consistent) has also shown a big decline in ""Deep Sleep"" since bulking - from \~2 hours a night to 50-70 minutes. I've made no other significant life changes between these two periods of time.  


What do you all make of sleep quality changes when bulking? Some factors I wonder about maybe contributing to this:  


\-Increased eating before bed (more digestion during sleep)

\-Anabolic state means more time spent growing muscle, which maybe is somehow costlier on my metabolism?  


&amp;#x200B;

Maybe none of this really matters. I feel as if I could be more well rested than I am, but not incredibly so.

1480,Fitness,0,"Finding it hard to use my back muscles when doing barbell rows. EDIT: I just want to thank everyone for their helpful input. There are too many to reply to every one individually.

Hi,

I started doing thefitness.wiki beginner [routine](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/) a few months ago. When I do barbell rows, I find it hard to keep my elbows tucked into my sides because it forces me to twist my wrists, which in turn causes me to lift entirely with my arms and (at least it feels like) not engage my lats at all. I've found through experimentation that if I deload a lot or use dumbells instead (because I can twist wrist so my grip runs front to back instead of left to right), it helps engage my lats. For reference, I'm currently rowing 50 kg (110 lbs) and benching 40 kg (88 lbs). I've read or heard (thought it was on the guide but I don't see it there now so I'm not sure which) that benches and rows are complementary exercises. Does this mean they should be approximately the same load? Therefore, should I

* Switch to dumbell rows?

* Deload to my bench weight or less and try to fix my form with the barbell?

* Something else entirely?

Thanks for your help.",finding hard use muscle doing barbell row edit just want thank helpful input reply individually hi started doing thefitness wiki beginner routine thefitness wiki routine r basic beginner routine month ago barbell row hard elbow tucked side force twist wrist turn cause lift entirely arm feel like engage lat experimentation deload lot use dumbells instead twist wrist grip run instead left right help engage lat reference m currently rowing kg lb benching kg lb read heard thought guide don t m sure bench row complementary exercise doe mean approximately load switch dumbell row deload bench weight try fix form barbell entirely thanks help

1482,Fitness,0,"120 Days of Progress DEXA Scans included. Was able to add muscle while losing fat and weight.  

Total 4 month progression seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/4i3Aqxe)

TLDR: Wanted a change and managed to lose weight and add well over 100lbs to a couple of my big lifts and did it by holding progressive overload as the most vital aspect of training while trying to safely lift as heavy as i could....also lost well over 10lbs of fat in the process.

Let's start off with a big THANK YOU to those of you who provide information and discussion in this community. I'm by no means an expert...a lot of which would be clear with a surface level analysis of my routine....and seeing the conversations here has helped me find a way...so I'm posting this with the hope I can help at least one person. (by directing them to the recommended routines lol)

**Physical background:** I'm a 36 year old former athlete with arthritis and the lasting impact of 2 reconstructive knee surgeries and a lifetime of basketball. I'm 6'0'' and at the start of this whole thing I weighed 212 lbs

These were my numbers to start with back in August when I looked like the before picture above

Squat: 260

Bench:270

Deadlift:225

OHP:155

So, on August 1 I set out to lose some weight first and foremost as 217 was just killing me....CICO was the method using MyFitnessPal and my Apple Watch and the workouts were like this....this is all basically cardio tbh so skip down to the second month if you're about that REAL [r/fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/) action

August 1st: P90X CHEST AND BACK (workout available online)

2nd: 40 min Cardio on Bike

3rd: P90X shoulders and arms

4th: 40 min Cardio Eliptical

5th: P90X Legs and Back

6th: REST DAY

7th: 40 min cardio

Then i'd repeat that weekly stretch through the end of the month...I'd done many rounds of P90X in my past and knew the workouts (as well as their shortcomings) and how they have impacted my body. Was able to get down to a weight of 198 lbs when I went for my first DEXA scan.

[Scan and picture](https://imgur.com/a/8x8WgBz)

Numbers: 17.2 % Body Fat at 198 LBS with 34 lbs of fat tissue and 154.7 lbs of lean tissue

So there I was, down to 198 and looking to continue to lose fat down to a goal of 15% while also getting some muscle. So here was the plan

**MONTH 2 and Beyond**

**Diet:** I was dead set on gaining muscle and losing fat so there would need to be some changes beyond CICO (I believed)

I was going to stay around 200-300 calories over maintenance level including exercise so with my workout plan that came to about 2900 or so calories a day with about 190 G of protein a day...i TRIED to limit carbs at first but my numbers stalled in the gym. So i wound up getting about 35% of my calories from carbs 30% from fat and 25% from Protein

My supplements were 5g of Creatine Monohydrate and 10g of Raw milled Flaxseeds a day (in cereal, because carbs baby) and a multivitamin

**Workouts:**

What I wound up settling on after reading all of the recommended workouts and routines was a modified version of GZCL...3 workouts a week and spaced to allow me to handle work and childcare...because it was only 3 days i would have some marathon sessions lasting well past 1.5 hours (which was long for me but now i've adjusted to it) Progressive overload and making sure to increase volume was a priority so the STRONG app on IOS came through in that regard.

The two workouts featured an 8 min warmup on the treadmil at 6mph

**Lower:**

Squat: 5 sets of 1-3 at 85% Max

Deadlift: 5 sets of 1-3 at 85% Max

Let Press: 5 Sets of 1-3 at 85% Max

Bulgarian Split Squat: 3x10

Lunges: 3x10

Calf raises: 3x10

Weighted Crunches: 3x10

Weighted Leg Raises 3x10

Weighted Russian Twists 3X10

Loaded Carry: 400 Feet

**Upper**

Bench Press:5 sets 1-3 at 85%

OHP: 5 sets at 1-3 at 85%

Weighted Pull Ups: 5 Sets 1-3 at 85% max ( i love pull ups)

Weighted Dips 3x10

Iso Row 3x10

Weighted Crunches: 3x10

Weighted Leg Raises 3x10

Weighted Russian Twists 3X10

I would alternate these workouts with off days....sometimes three times a week....sometimes if i could sneak an extra day in I would. I just wanted to have a base goal of getting in there and kicking ass at the very least three times a week.

You can see my results and DEXA scans from about 2.5 months later [Here](https://imgur.com/a/uSlyFbF)

Current Numbers

13.2% Bodyfat at 195 LBS 25 lbs of fat tissue and 159.4 pounds of lean tissue.

**I'D MANAGED TO GAIN 5LBS OF MUSCLE WHILE LOSING 10 LBS OF FAT**

was this the result of powerlifting newbie gains? I've got no idea...but whatever I did my body really responded well to it...so i'm going to keep doing this. My current max numbers are

Bench:305

Squat:375

Deadlift:415

OHP: 165 (shoulder pain...idk what that's all about but i'm working through it)

Pull-ups: 12 with 65lbs added

Not sure what the shoulder thing is but it's only really a limitation when i do OHP or max bench...it's been around for a few years now.

Due to a range of injuries over the past few years I have recently decided to put an emphasis on varying my exercises to improve my strength in different ROM's/positions and work on muscles normally neglected.

Recently I have implemented a lot more deficit and snatch pulls (Increase ROM/stretch hamstrings and use lower weight with the same fatigue levels) and single arm dumbell presses (stability), along with a lot more direct hamstring and spine flexion work (on a 45 degree back extender, flexing and arching my back). I am looking for more odd lifts that will improve overall mobility and full body strength in a ***commercial*** gym, having dumbells only up to 50kg/110lbs and normal straight barbells only.

Any recommendations welcome! I am thinking things that involve twisting or side bending (like a suitcase deadlift) and ROM's not usually seen in PL, exercises with large ROM's too.

1501,Fitness,0,"How strong is the correlation between strength and size?

1517,Fitness,0,"Gained 5kg and heavily increased my 1RM, yet no change in apparence. Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I started doing the 5/3/1 for beginners in april for 2 months, had a 3 months summer break, and continued from sepetember to middle of november. I had already been lifting prior to that, but mainly ""bro programs"" (for exemple only doing curls and no leg days).

I am 18M, 1.78m tall and ate around 3000 kcal per day and about 150g of protein per day, tracked on the myfitness app. My initial lifts were 95kg squat; 110kg deadlift; 70kg bench press; 40kg OHP.

At the end, my lifts were 125kg squat; 140kg deadlift; 80kg bench press and 50kg OHP.

Yet the problem is even though this progress was very satisfying for me, my main goal was overall apparence rather than strenght and hitting certain numbers, and even though I gained 5 kg, there was no change in size in my apparence.

Start 72kg:  [https://imgur.com/a/O2uxCxi](https://imgur.com/a/O2uxCxi) 

End 77.5kg+:  [https://imgur.com/a/xAqAnI1](https://imgur.com/a/xAqAnI1) 

In my opinion, I just look a little more fat and don't look any better. The increase in strenght and lifts is nice, but not my primary goal, and the lack of physical progress has sucked out all my motivation. Knowing that I could gain another 5kg and have as little/none change like that takes out the aim of going to the gym for me.

How is it possible that I have good results in numbers but none in front of the mirror? Have I underestimated myself and the 5/3/1 is too ""beginer"" for me? Is it too strenght oriented and I should try a wiki program that focuses on building size? If so, which one? Most programs on the wiki say ""size and strenght"", just like for the 5/3/1.

1526,Fitness,0,"This is a great series by James Krieger on body-fat percentage measurement. Its pretty long, so I went ahead and made you guys a summary of all the methods of measuring bf% and how accurate they are. https://weightology.net/the-pitfalls-of-body-fat-measurement-part-1/

So before we get started, here’s a link to part one of the series. I highly recommend you read the whole thing, it's really good. 

So as a preface: All accuracy rates mentioned here are compared to what's called a four compartment model. This involves: 

- Measuring body density with underwater weighing, 

- Total body water with a technique called deuterium dillution, 
- And bone mineral content using DEXA scans. 

Equations are used to get the estimates for the four components (Fat, water, mineral, and protein) total. This is by far the most accurate estimate of all, but its not accessible for most people.

With that being said, here’s all of them


##Underwater Weighing:

- Weighs you in an underwater tank, measures how much water you displace. Fat floats and Fat Free Mass (FFM) tends to sink. They calculate body density from that and get bodyfat percentage.
- Good results when looking at group averages, poor results when looking at individuals. Not a good choice when trying to find out your personal bodyfat percentage and body composition changes.
- Sources of error include:
      1. Air left in lungs (which is often estimated)
      2. Having air bubbles in your hair
      3. Weight gain or loss over time (which can change FFM density)
      4. Hydration status
      5. The equations that convert body density into bodyfat percentage

- Error Margin for Individuals
    1. **Error rate up to 5-6%**
    2. **Even more prone to error when tracking body composition over time**

##Bod Pod:

- Similar principles to underwater weighing, but uses air displacement instead of water.

- Overall worse then underwater weighing.

- Sources of error:
       1. All of the above factors for underwater weighing (cept everything having to do with water, like bubbles in your hair)
       2. Facial hair
       3. Body temperature
       4. Moisture
       5. The tightness of the spandex or swimsuit used in the measurement process

- Error margin for individuals: 
     1. **Up to 15% (seriously)**
     2. **even worse for tracking changes over time.**



##Bioelectrical Impedance:

- Runs a light electrical current through your body. Due to the fact that FFM contains mostly water and fat contains very little water the FFM will have less resistance to this electrical current. Uses this to predict bodyfat %. 
- Convenient, but at the cost of accuracy.

- This includes any of those handheld devices that track bodyfat (like this) , or any of the scales that you step on that gives you your bodyfat percentage.

- If you keep a strict hydration schedule (same amount of water every day, drink and pee at same time per day, ect) average a scale and handheld device together, and wait a VERY long time between measurements so that a large changes is made then it can kinda sorta maybe be used….ish.

- Sources of error
    1. How prone you are to storing subcutaneous fat as opposed to visceral fat.
    2. Will miss entire sections of your body, handheld devices will miss your entire lower body, scales you step on will miss your entire upper body. (You can probably take a handheld device and a scale device and avarage the two together and get a slightly more accurate reading.)
    3. Will be completely thrown off by changes in hydration, this is one of the largest sources of error.
    4. Its often a prediction based off of a prediction, devices are made and tested in comparison to hydrostatic weighing (which is also bad for individuals).

- Error Margin for Individuals:
     1. **Up to 8%**
     2. **Also poor for tracking changes in body composition over time** (As a matter of fact, in one study using BMI to track body composition was more accurate for changes over time...yeah…)



##Skinfolds
- Skinfolds are measured by taking a device known as a caliper, pinching the skin and fat underneath the skin, pulling the skinfold away, and measuring the thickness of the skinfold with the caliper. 
- Usually done at numerous sites around the body. The thicknesses are added together and plugged into an equation that spits out your bodyfat percentage.
- Can be from 3-7 to more sites, the more places you pinch the more accurate it is.
- This is actually a good measurement for tracking changes in bodyfat over time IF you:
    1. Learn to do it properly, [here’s a good tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx7pHJomSTc)
    2. Don’t even bother calculating the bodyfat percentage, just take the caliper measurements and if its going down, you're losing fat.

- Sources of error:
     1. Skill of the person taking the readings (biggest by far)
     2. The equation you pop your skinfolds into
     3. Changes in bodyfat over time resulting in FFM density changes.

- Error margin for individuals:
    1. **Up to 10-15%**
    2. Not very good at measuring changes in body composition *if you use the equation to find a percentage.* 
    3. **Error rates of 3-5% for changes over time.**

##The almighty DEXA

- Once used to determine bone density, the DEXA scan works by measuring your body’s absorbance of x rays at two different energies. Tracks fat, bone mineral, and Fat Free Soft Tissue.

- Despite that people often take the DEXA scan as a holy grail of body composition measurement, its actually not that great. 

- Although admittedly better then our other options, I personally think its not worth the 100-200 dollars it costs to get one.

- Sources of Error: 
    1. Inconsistent results between different machines from both the same and different manufacturer(s). 
    2. Changes in software. 
    3. Changes in software/hardware configurations.
    4. The type of X ray beam
    5. Hydration status
    6. Ethnicity and body type

- Error Margin for individuals:
     1. **Anywhere from 4% to 8% to 10% depending which study you look at.**
     2. Not super great at tracking changes over time either, Individual error rate was as high as 4% over time.
     3. Seems to overestimate decreases in bodyfat, underestimates increases in body fat.
     4. Also seems to over estimate total bodyfat percentage as well (at least compared to most)

Personally, my favorite method is to use the mirror for the final estimation of bodyfat - However because most people underestimate their bodyfat, I use the [US Navy Method](http://fitness.bizcalcs.com/Calculator.asp?Calc=Body-Fat-Navy) and calipers to calculate my bodyfat only for the sake of keeping myself honest.

Discussion Questions:

- **Do you know how to track your bodyfat percentage?** 

- **If so, do you track your bodyfat percentage?**

- **If you do, how do you personally track your bodyfat percentage?**

- **Have you had good results with any of the above methods that were shat on in this series?**

1540,Fitness,0,"Hypertrophy with lighter weights I 'm starting working out again after a period of inactivity. Unfortunately, today, life doesn't make it easy for me to go to a proper gym. However, I have a home gym that I have been composing over the years, which basically has dumbbells, plates, kettlebells and bands of different resistances.

For personal and space reasons I had to get rid of squat stands, bars and large plates, so what I have to work with are more moderate weights and essentially dumbbells and kettlebells.

So bit of background M/31/85kg and I'd consider myself fairly muscular/lean for my build. 
I'm going from a cut to maintenance steadily. Figured I'd reverse it like I did coming down the weight. just increase week by week slowly to get there, else I'll just binge eat (I know what I'm like!)

Been losing weight quite steadily past 3 months. About 1-1.5 Lb a week. I'd reached deficient cals of 1800 before I started reintroducing more.

Figured I'd increase slowly to 2400 (current calculated tdee) as not to gorge  and lose control slightly.

1568,Fitness,0,"Question about varying weights between strength and hypertrophy days Hi,

I am going to start on the PPL program recommended on the sub's wiki, and had a question about how much I should be lifting for the same lift but on different days.

For example, for the bench press, the program says to do 4x5, 1x5+ on the first push day of the week then 3x8-12 on the second push day of the week.

I would assume that the amount of weight would differ based on whether I am doing 4x5 vs 3x8-12 (lifting more when doing 4x5)? Or should I be trying to use the same weights on both push days.

1575,Fitness,0,"Progressive overload halted by strength gain [Beginner]

I've been regularly working out for 6 months. Seen impressive strength gains in some exercises (12 inverse Pull ups instead of 6 at the beginning), but in others I don't seem to make progress (Triceps isolation being the worst).

I always train more or less to failure with sets with reduced reps (e.g. 12-9-7) - as many as I can do maintaining decent form. But since I'm going to failure there is just no way to overload an exercise (more reps or heavier) if I don't get stronger.

Should I decrease load and purposefully not go to failure to be able to overload? If so, won't I run into the same problem some weeks later when I get closer to failure again? Is it bad to go to failure? A lot of guys seem to maintain reps for different sets, which means the sets get harder for you, right? It's kinda frustrating, since the main ""progress bar"" I use is load-gain, cause I'm too lazy to do size measurements and don't wanna do pics... Any help is appreciated!

1578,Fitness,0,"5/3/1 BBB 3 Month Challenge - A review including progress pics and full routine  **Back story:** Male, 24 years old, been lifting for almost 4 years, herniated my disc two years ago, got told to never squat/deadlift/Lift heavy overhead again. Through lots of stretching, Sports massage and carefully perfecting form before going heavy i have been able to do all and finally smashed through previous PR's during this program.

[Pics:](https://imgur.com/a/V7nA5DK) Shortly after back injury recovery and first session back / Start of BBB / End of BBB

(ive taken pictures every month since i started lifting again, i highly recommend doing it for comparisons)

**Body Stats and changes:**

Shortly after back injury recovery: 85kg 19% BF

Start of BBB: 81kg 14% BF

End of BBB: 85kg 17% BF

**Routine and why i changed it slightly:** The base of the routine i got from the 3 month BBB challenge listed on T-Nation before reading the books. When i didnt understand it fully i went back, got the books and adjusted accordingly. All 5 x 10 were done at 50% of 1RM the three weeks, 60% 1RM the second 3 weeks and 70% on the thrid three weeks. I Switched from a very high volume PPL so going down to what the book said to do felt like almost nothing, so i added quite a few extra accessories as my body could recover fine. I know alot of people will say ive added to many extra accessories and thats fine i felt like that on its own was not enough so i added more. I switch from back squat to a front squat and Leg press as i found back squating aggrevated my back so instead of being in pain/hurt my self more i switch it out for similar movements. I added some joker sets in during the second phase but was too tired during the last phase. So this was the final routine.

* **Mon:** Deadlift 5/3/1 - Leg press 5x10 - Glute bridges 3x10 - 2 x Ab variations x 15
* **Tues:** OHP 5/3/1 - Bench 5x10 - Wide lat pull down 3x10 - Close grip lat pulldown 3 x10 Dumbell one arm Tricep Ext 3 x 10 EZ Bar Curl 3 x 10
* **Weds:** Rest / Stretch routine
* **Thurs:** Front squat 5/3/1 - Deadlift 5x10 - Single leg extension 3 x 10 - Calve raise machine 3 x 10 2 x Ab variations x 15
* **Fri:** Bench 5/3/1 - OHP 5 x 10 - Seated cable row 3 x 10 - Face pulls 3 x 10 - Tricep pushdown 3 x 10 - Dumbell hammer curls 3 x 10

**Routine Summary:** The 5/3/1 combo was really good from switching from 5x5. It felt refreshing and the numbers moved each week so you never lifted the same weights always felt like it was improving. It reccomends in the book and on the challnege on the final AMRAP set to only do that number of reps, which i ignored and AMRAP as i always felt like i had more in the tank. The first three weeks of BBB accessories i thought 'this is way to easy'. 50% was too light and is too light but by the end of the 6th week i was missing them days. 60% for 10 reps is hard and by the end i was very tired but that does not compare to the 70% on the next few weeks. Rest time between sets went up from 60 seconds to 120 sometimes higher if needed. If you are just starting out on this program and feel like you need more, i understand, but get to week 6 and then see if you feel the same. Deload wise i skipped the first one as i felt good, after 6 weeks i took a week deload and went down to 50% of everything as is stated in the books.

**Pre / Post BBB 1RM:**

* Bench *81kg /* **94kg**
* OHP *46kg /* **53kg**
* Deadlift *128kg* / **147kg**
* Front squat *78kg* / **93kg**

**Eating:**

I'm currently in a bulking phase, i was when i started eating around 3000 cals but now up to 3300 to allow for my body getting used to the higher cals. I plan to bulk the whole of 2020 and get as big as possibly before doing a cut for summer 2021 which then ill maintain hopefully as ill be to a good size.

Macro split if anyone is intrested: *C:371g P:248g F:96g*

**What next:**

Next we go back to PPL. I want to get bigger in size overall and feel that PPL is better as a upper lower split (which is what this kinda is) is focused more towards strength over size. I plan on keeping the 5/3/1 for the main lifts and possibly so FSL if i feel strong enough.

I have been following the StrongLifts 5x5 program for 6 months now. I had never lifted before.

Here are my current numbers for 5x5:

* Squat: 200lbs
* Bench: 120lbs
* Row: 120lbs
* OHP: 90lbs
* DL: 220lbs

I am plateauing on all those lifts on 5x5. I can still increase my lifts if I only do 3x3 or 1x1 but I am stuck at those weights for 5x5. 

My idea is to stop this linear progression program like StrongLifts and start doing a program that's more evolved like 5/3/1 because it seems better for my situation and goals which is to increase my main lifts.

So, as I say in the title, I find it a little concerning to change from 5x5 squat 3x a week to only once, and still progress.

1582,Fitness,0,"BodPod Techniques for Accuracy? First time poster here. I am planning on getting my body fat tested as I am curious to where I am sitting at and use it as motivation as I begin my cut for an upcoming vacation in February. I have used the InBody test in my gym but I am seeking out a more accurate test. 

I understand that there is no accurate way to test for bodyfat and each method has their inaccuracies, pros, cons, etc. Taking availability, location and price into consideration, I am choosing to use the BodPod method. 

My question is, what should I do to get the most accurate reading? People always say that you can skew your results based on hydration, going to the bathroom, caffeine intake, fasted vs fed. I am aiming to get the most accurate read on my body fat and not the “best number”. Any tips on how to do this? 

I know that for the BodPod I will need to wear compression shorts and a swim cap. I have also been taking creatine (HCL) for the last 4 weeks, not sure if that matters or not.

1584,Fitness,0,"Which muscle groups benefit from training 3x/week? I've read in numerous places, including some of the rationale for programs listed in the FAQ, that smaller muscles such as biceps, triceps, delts, and abs recover more quickly than lats, quads, glutes, pecs, traps, etc., with recovery windows for the former estimated at 36-48 hours, and more like 72 hours for the latter.

With that in mind, is there any sense in training those smaller groups 3x week, if you can fit it into your program, or are the returns going to be too diminishing to bother thinking about? Any difference if the goal is more focused towards either strength or hypertrophy?

As an example, I've read seemingly-qualified advice to perform lateral raises 3x/week for accelerating lateral delt growth, but yet I don't believe I've come across a reputable program that includes that.

I've read Jim's book, and he does say not to try to modify the program, and he also says you can't use the program with dumbbells. He literally says that ""if you don't know the reason, you don't lift long enough"". I guess it's because it's harder to progress with dumbbells.

But I don't want to find another program. Are there any variations of 5/3/1 that use dumbbells and/or cables for the main lift for chest &amp; shoulders?

1589,Fitness,0,"Inzer Belt Lever 10mm vs 13mm? Repost from r/powerlifting.

Hey everyone. After utilizing a cheap leather double-prong Harbinger belt for one year (and switching to velcro later for another year), I'm finally now taking the next step to get a competitive and high-quality belt for myself after I reached an intermediate level. Right now, my SBD maxes are 345/270/395 at 190 lbs, 5'3.5. Yeah, i'm heavy af for my height, but I am making sure that I will never reach 200, and hope to cut down over time.

I've been wanting an Inzer belt though for such a long time, but i'm really uncertain on whether I would want the 10mm or the 13mm. I know the two don't have much difference unless i'm really an elite lifter.

To sum up, I am considering the Inzer to be the last belt I would ever purchase and need for my lifting career. That being said, should I go for the 10mm since I'm short, not as advanced yet, and am planning to cut over time? Or should I go for the 13mm, since I am planning to keep this belt for the many years to come, and wear it still when hitting monster lifts?

Edit/Result: Just ordered a 10mm in Royal Blue this morning, thanks everyone for the advice!

1596,Fitness,0,"Is doing squats everyday counter productive? My wife has joined a challenge where they do 5 more squats everyday for a month. Is this considered overtraining?

Edit: First thanks to everyone who took the time to answer constructively; it's appreciated. After reading some responses, it seems that more explanation may be necessary.  I tried to keep the original post very short as it seems more attention is given to questions that don't require a TL;DR.

At the beginning, years and years ago, I first got into regular exercise by jumping on the P90X train. I did the program twice, back to back, in the evenings, while running every other day (~3 miles in the morning). I followed with P90X2, then the third, and ended up with a great habit and the loss of 100lbs.

Fast forward, my wife and I met, I got swept away in life (work, us, etc.), and I let the habit slip. We jumped back on the wagon together with P90X3, got in shape a bit and had a good time while doing it. Then she got pregnant and the story repeated itself. 

Now that the baby is here, it's time to 'stand back up'... so we decided to find a program to help jump start the process. She had been previously familiar with 21 Day fix, so I agreed to do it with her. The workout isn't bad, it's not high intensity, but it's a start, and it only takes 30 days to make (or break) a habit, so I couldn't see any harm. I break a sweat, we alternate the workouts so that I have the baby and she works out, then she takes the baby and I work out.

At the very beginning of this, she found a challenge group that adds bodyweight squats to the workout everyday (FB challenge). So after the first workout is over, do 5 body weight squats. Second day, second workout, ten squats. Third day, third workout, 15 squats. The pattern continues in this fashion. 

After doing similar programs before, as well as 12+ years martial arts (age 5 - 17), then directly to the USMC, I had heard many, many times that you should give every muscle a break to recover. It was drilled into us that the recovery is important for the growth of the muscle and when it doesn't occur it can produce undesirable, even negative, effects.  My first thought was this is going to be counter productive. After a quick Google search, I saw the word overtraining used in reference to this concept. My apologies to all those deeply offended by my use of it.",doing squat everyday counter productive wife joined challenge squat everyday month considered overtraining edit thanks took time answer constructively s appreciated reading response explanation necessary tried original post short attention given question don t require tl dr beginning year year ago got regular exercise jumping p x train did program twice evening running day mile morning followed p x ended great habit loss lb fast forward wife met got swept away life work let habit slip jumped wagon p x got shape bit good time doing got pregnant story repeated baby s time stand decided program help jump start process previously familiar day fix agreed workout isn t bad s high intensity s start take day make break habit couldn t harm break sweat alternate workout baby work take baby work beginning challenge group add bodyweight squat workout everyday fb challenge workout body weight squat second day second workout squat day workout squat pattern continues fashion doing similar program year martial art age directly usmc heard time muscle break recover drilled recovery important growth muscle doesn t occur produce undesirable negative effect thought going counter productive quick google search saw word overtraining used reference concept apology deeply offended use

I made a progress post a year ago and figured I'd share my journey progressing: www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/96gy90/m186312_months_progress_178_205lbs/

I know my leg lifts haven't really progressed that well due to injuries and hard work on my feet for my job getting in the way, but I'm still satisfied with my progress.


For my diet I typically eat eggs every morning with Greek yogurt and a protein shake. For lunch I usually eat lunch meat sandwiches of salami, pepperoni, and ham with carrots, grapes, a protein bar, cosmic brownies, water, and Greek yogurt for sides. For dinner I typically eat either chicken, steak or pork with milk, greek yogurt and veggies. 

I've kept up with mostly the same routine, but I've added significantly more bicep and tricep work since last year:

Day 1: 1 arm DB Rows 4 x 8 - 12, Lat Pull down (Or Pull-ups) 4 x 10-12, DB Curls 4 x 8 - 12, OH Tricep Ext (BB, Cable or DB) 4 x 12 - 15, Incline DB Bench 3 x 8-10, dips, reverse preacher curls, cable flies, Bench Press (nSuns), OHP (nSuns)

Day 2: Leg Extensions 4 x 10 - 12, Leg Curls 4 x 12-15, Glutes Cable Pull throughs (Optional) 4 x 12 - 15 , Hanging Leg Raises 3 x 20, Cable Crunches 3 x 10-12, BB Calf Raises 4 x 10 - 15, Squat, Sumo deadlift

Day 3: Facepulls 3 x 12-15 SS Hammer Curls (DB or Cable), Lateral raises 4 x 12-15, Cable Crossovers 4 x 12-15, Incline Bench, chin ups, various other bicep exercises (just depends what's open at my uni rec) OHP

Day 4: Seated Cable Rows 4 x 10-12, Lat Pull-downs (or pull-ups) 4 x 10 - 12, Hyperextension 2 x 12 - 15, Insert 1-2 Abs movements of your choice (Can be the same as last time. That was an example of two you could do...), BB Calf Raises 4 x 10-15, Deadlift, Front Squat

Day 5: Facepulls 4 x 15-20 SS Tricep Pull downs 4 x 10 - 12, Incline DB Curls or Preachers Curls 4 x 8 - 12, Lateral Raises 4 x 12 -15, DB Curls (Slow) 4 x 10 - 12, bicep work (depends on whats available at my uni rec) Bench, Close grip bench

1611,Fitness,0,"""Trampolining is 3x as effective than running"" Saw this statement posted on Facebook from a mini-trampolining class post.

My immediate thought was that the statement is misleading as it doesn't actually state what it's more effective at, but I'll assume it's talking about calorie use as that seems to be the goal of the class (fitness orientated, pictures of young and middle-aged women, claims it burns ""up to 800 calories"" an hour).

Reading up online this statement is taken from a NASA study in 1980 but I can find very little about this other than news articles/""rebounding"" websites using the claim without any real citations. From what I have been able to find out, the study was only covering 8 young males and that the trampolines in the study were full size trampolines, not mini-trampolines with limited ""bounce"".

Given that there appears to be an industry coming out of this study I'm surprised there's not more information other than the parroting of the conclusion.

Does anyone have any more information about this? It's got me curious.",trampolining x effective running saw statement posted facebook mini trampolining class post immediate thought statement misleading doesn t actually state s effective ll assume s talking calorie use goal class orientated picture young middle aged woman claim burn calorie hour reading online statement taken nasa study little news article rebounding website using claim real citation able study covering young male trampoline study size trampoline mini trampoline limited bounce given appears industry coming study m surprised s information parroting conclusion doe information s got curious

Similar issue for trap bar deadlifts, I don't know how to program these without causing too much fatigue during a workout. For reference my ATG squat is 1.4x bodyweight currently.

1. Squat, Hip Thrust, Plyometric

2. Deadlift, Reverse Lunge, Plyometric

1. ~3sets Quarter Squat 1-3RPM, 2 sets ATG 5 RPM, Hip Thrust, Unilateral Plyometric

2. Trap Bar Deadlift (w/ weight I struggle to get off ground), Rack Pull (to replace regular deadlift lower back benefit), Reverse Lunge, Plyometric

1627,Fitness,0,"""Work hard in the gym"" seems to be contradictory to ""keep good form"" and I'd like help understanding this I'm an experienced lifter, and I know the importance of all of the lifting/nutrition fundamentals. Set goals. Be consistent. Work smart. Lift with good form. Check your pride at the door.

A concept that has long eluded me is working hard in the gym.

Of course if we're talking about not skipping leg day, preparing adequately for workouts, and not just screwing around on your phone for 15 minutes between sets before calling it a day after a couple of exercises, then I fully understand it.

But in the middle of a set, *lifting hard* is a concept that I just don't get. It seems contradictory to the other advice because beyond a certain point, pushing hard in the middle of a set will almost necessarily cause form breakdowns. Let's say I'm doing Romanian Deadlifts, and it's a really tough set where I'm giving it my all with shaky legs and slipping grip. I could potentially pull out another couple of reps, but my form would likely break down as well, my back would likely round, and they wouldn't be clean. 

AMRAP sets would be a good example of this too--everyone knows it's as many reps as possible *with good form*.

For almost every lift, the number of repetitions I can complete with perfect form doesn't seem to ever exceed the point where I feel like I'm working truly hard to my brink. There are a couple of lifts where I really feel that point where my last rep was absolutely gutted out from my core (overhead press is one because past a certain point it's really just pushing the bar into the air), but for many lifts like barbell rows, RDLs, squats, and deadlifts, form breakdowns happen first.

I'm using a peloton bike for cardio, which is paired with a Garmin HRM run chest strap to measure my heart rate. I'm also wearing a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 watch. I input my stats (age, weight, etc) into both respective programs to get as accurate a burned calorie count as possible.

After doing my 45 minute LISS workout, aiming for an average heart rate of 60% of my VO2 max, I noticed a pretty significant discrepancy between the calorie counts of both devices. My bike said I burned around 400 calories while my watch said I burned around 320. I realize that neither device is going to be 100% accurate, but I was wondering which number I should trust more? I'd like to keep a decent record of calories burned in myfitnesspal as part of my new program.

1633,Fitness,0,"How often should you weigh yourself while trying to lose weight? Weight loss for me is taking simple steps but small ones and not worrying about any numbers. I do things like adding an extra walk to my day, this needn't be a marathon, just walking to the shops and back (30 mins or so) or cutting out 1 unhealthy food, that is putting on the pounds. For me, this would be pizza, biscuits or chocolate.

You know when you are [losing weight](http://provenpeptides.com) just as you know you are losing it. Classic symptoms like buttons straining and clothes going from snug to strangling.

I these cases it is better not to weigh yourself. Looking at the numbers is disheartening and even worse can cause you to reach for comfort food.

The only time I weighed myself regularly was when I weighed myself at a pharmacy. This involved a cycle or walk to get there which I didn't normally do.

1634,Fitness,0,"How much cardio is enough for mental health benefits? Hello

I started doing cardio 2-3 months ago mainly for benefits related to generalized anxiety disorder. Unsurprisingly, it has numerous benefits such as more energy, more discipline, a feeling of freshness and so on.

I have very weak joints and for this reason, every time I have started weight-lifting, something started aching (knees, elbow). Most doctors (4-5) told me that my joints are not fully developed (?) and I should try not to stress them too much. For this reason, even though I really wanted to learn some kind of martial arts, I have refrained to do so. 

Running is out of the question, so the next thing I tried for some reason was rope jumping which lasted for 2ish weeks until my right knee started aching. After much trial and error, I have found that the elliptical machine works well for me so that's what I've been doing. 

I'm doing HIIT mode on the machine, half time on low resistance and half time on max resistance. I started with 30 minutes at first and have started doing 1 hour now.

I'd like to know, considering that other exercises are out of the question, how much cardio is enough for me to get max benefits for mental health and cardiovascular health? I am feeling like I still have much energy after 1-hour work out

And the second question, should I tire myself 100%? Should I feel absolutely exhausted after it's over? 

Third question: is HIIT  a good way to go or should I rather do more stable but high resistance training?

Thank you! :)",cardio benefit hello started doing cardio month ago mainly benefit related generalized anxiety disorder unsurprisingly numerous benefit energy discipline feeling freshness weak joint reason time started weight lifting started aching knee elbow doctor told joint fully developed try stress reason really wanted learn kind martial art refrained running question thing tried reason rope jumping lasted ish week right knee started aching trial error elliptical machine work s doing m doing hiit mode machine half time low resistance half time max resistance started minute started doing hour d like know considering exercise question cardio max benefit cardiovascular feeling like energy hour work second question tire feel absolutely exhausted s question hiit good way stable high resistance training thank

I (29/176cm/72kg) am looking for a plan that takes 40-45 minutes and that I can do every day.

The goal is to build more muscle and be generally fit. 

I used to do PPL exactly like in the wiki for about 1,5 years. (one workout took me around 60-75min)

Now to get back at it, I am doing stronglifts + accessories since 2 months.  
I also want to have a regimen where i can go to the gym every day at the same time to build consistency. 

My question is:

  
Do I have to kick out some exercises or do you think it is possible to reach the time limit by reducing weight and limiting the rest periods to strictly 60 sec?

If I have to kick out some.. which??   
Or is there another plan that fits my needs better?

I'm working to get fit. Specifically, I (22F, 5'2"", 200lbs) am looking to lose about 40lbs of fat while maintaining as much muscle as I can. 

For the next five months, I have an exercise plan in place that includes hitting the gym 4 times a week and participating in active college clubs (MMA, Jui Jitsu, and swing dancing). This works out to an average of 2.5hrs of exercise a day. According to my math, I should be burning about 4,000 calories a week through these activities. 

My sedentary BMR is about 1,600 calories (22F, 5'2"", 200lbs). I would think that these activities would put me at a much higher ""activity level,"" increasing my BMR closer to 2,500.

I had some muscle memory and also high test levels naturally, which is why i put on weight easily with a pretty bad diet, but i work out very hard with a 3 day split, day 1 chest triceps, day 2 back biceps, day 3 legs and shoulders. 

Only downside is im growing too big for my david bowie shirt lol.

Choose life.

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the feedback, you guys made me feel better than any drug ever did.

EDIT: Progress is from 20-22 years old, and ive kept to mostly the same peogram and exercises, the 3 day split i mentioned above, but sometimes mixing it up with back and chest 1 day and arms another day my most common program and exercises went like this:

Day 1 chest/triceps

4 sets of incline dumbell press for 8-15 reps, 25-30 kg
4 sets of cable flies 45 kg each side, 8-20 reps.
4-5 sets of tricep pushdowns changing from low weight to high weight, 45 kg to 80 kg.
4-5 sets of skullcrushers with dumbells, low weight high reps, 15 kg for 20ish reps.

Day 2 back/biceps 
5 sets of weighted pullups with 15 kg, 8 reps.
4 sets of lat pulldowns 80 kg, 8 reps.
4 sets of seated cable rows, 80 kg 8-12 reps.
5 sets of bicep curls with dumbells, 20 kg 8-16 reps
5 sets of hammer curls with cable, 50 kg for 8-20 reps.

Day 3 legs/shoulders 
5 sets of squats focusing on proper form, with 85 kg for 8-12 reps
5 sets of leg extensions 60-70 kg for 8-12 reps
5 sets of barbell overhead press 50 kg, 8-12 reps
Superset lateral raises 15 kg 5 sets for 8-16 reps with facepulls 30 kg 5 sets for 10-25 reps.

1653,Fitness,0,"Are deadlifts worth doing with boosters (the platforms you put on the ground so you don't have to get so low)? I've been trying to do better on my deadlifts, but it seems whenever I get to 225lb I seem to get a weird burning sensation in my lower abs that I believe is my hip flexor and then it feels tender for a couple days. It's not a hernia since I've had that checked already.

I can deadlift 135lb and 185lb pretty easily without any weird pain.

I've been going to the gym about a year and feel relatively fit.

Bench is at 255lb 2 rep max.

Squats I usually do a few sets of 225lb at 5 reps.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized I had weird form since I had my legs shoulder-width apart instead of hip-width apart. I stretch my hamstrings, hips, quads, groin, etc. after every workout. I even did some groin and hamstring stretches before got this sensation again during my deadlift.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: what's the best way to get stronger at my deadlifts? Should I do RDL's or just deadlift heavier weights with boosters? The sensation seems to trigger on my way up when the bar is below my knee.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: Wow! I didn't expect so many responses. There are a lot of good suggestions.**

**I do pretty crappy legs nowadays. I started out having a pretty solid leg day and then after about 3-4 months I started caring less and I've been lifting for about 11 months now. I really only work in squats, lunges, and calf raises on shoulder days as super sets and I play basketball typically once a week. Any core work I do is probably 2 ab exercises 3 times a week towards the end of the workout with my stretching at 10-15 reps like leg lifts, in-n-outs, sit-ups or twists.**

**I'm 200lb and 5 11'. I really only care about upper body since I store a lot of my fat in my thighs/quads so I don't look like I have chicken legs since my quads are naturally large.**

**Based on the suggestions I think I'll really just focus on volume and try deadlifting at 135lb at 15 reps with 4 sets or something like that to see how it goes. I was trying to get to 225lb since I see people who look less buff than me who can deadlift more than me and it pisses me off so it's definitely ego-lifting.**",deadlifts worth doing booster platform ground don t low trying better deadlifts lb weird burning sensation lower ab believe hip flexor feel tender couple day s hernia checked deadlift lb lb pretty easily weird pain going gym year feel relatively fit bench lb rep max squat usually set lb rep realized weird form leg shoulder width apart instead hip width apart stretch hamstring hip quad groin workout did groin hamstring stretch got sensation deadlift question s best way stronger deadlifts rdl s just deadlift heavier weight booster sensation trigger way bar knee edit wow didn t expect response lot good suggestion pretty crappy leg nowadays started having pretty solid leg day month started caring lifting month really work squat lunge calf raise shoulder day super set play basketball typically week core work probably ab exercise time week end workout stretching rep like leg lift n out sit ups twist m lb really care upper body store lot fat thigh quad don t look like chicken leg quad naturally large based suggestion think ll really just focus volume try deadlifting lb rep set like go trying lb people look buff deadlift piss s definitely ego lifting

1659,Fitness,0,"5/3/1 BBB OHP help So I’ve been running this program for a few months now and it’s been great except for OHP. By that I mean I am making progress, but it seems that the weight, after a certain number (115lbs for me) becomes strangely heavy.

Today for example was the start of my new cycle with a TM of 135. 

Did the first set at 1x5 @ 85lbs no problem. Second at 1x5 @95lbs (purposely didn’t do it at 100) was easy. My third set (85%) at 115 was disproportionately difficult compared to the first two and I could only manage 6 reps. I then did 3x10 at 95lbs and 2x10 at 85lbs comfortably so I clearly had some left in the tank.

Looking at these numbers, I’m left scratching my head. Last cycle I did my 95% set for 1x3 @125lbs so it’s not like I can’t press more than 115.  It’s just always seems to be the case when I load up 115, something happens and I struggle. Has anyone else come across something like this and if so, what do I need to do to fix it?",bbb ohp help running program month s great ohp mean making progress weight certain number lb strangely heavy today example start new cycle tm did set x lb problem second x lb purposely didn t easy set disproportionately difficult compared manage rep did x lb x lb comfortably clearly left tank looking number m left scratching head cycle did set x lb s like t press s just case load happens struggle come like need fix
1660,Fitness,0,"Can I cut while doing 5/3/1?

The gym is empty af every time I go, meaning I can't have someone spot me. That's why I feel more comfortable using the power rack. The gripe I have with it though is that the hole spacing is pretty far apart (uniform distance all the way, unlike those ones I see online with west side hole spacing, which look neato), meaning I can never really get the safety bars to the optimal level where they don't impede my range of motion ever so slightly (they get in the way just a few centimeters from my chest). As a result, I can't focus on just lifting when the bar keeps hitting the safeties on the way down and I have to keep moving my head, checking the sides per rep.

[Progress pic!](https://imgur.com/a/Q3cUjBH)

Let me start this off by saying I've been lifting for around 8 years now. In the beginning, I did the classic bro split of 5 days a week, one muscle group per day. I built up a decent foundation of size and strength that way but eventually got really bored with it after about 5 years. The next 2 years were more experimental as I was playing around with changing up my rest times, rep ranges, types of workouts, volume, intensity, etc. I wasn't enjoying my workouts until I started doing a 6 day PPL routine. After about a solid year of running this, I've been hitting good numbers (for me at least) while still maintaining my weight. It took a lot of trial and error, but I'm finally happy with where I'm at so I've decided to share my achievement with ya'll.

I try to do at least 20 minutes of steady-state cardio and 1 hour of walking 3x a week.

**Diet**

I do a very loose version of IF so I'll fast anywhere between 12 hours to 30 hours depending on how busy I can keep myself. Weighing my food and tracking my calories was done religiously because I have a huge appetite so I'll eat even if I'm full. I allow myself 2300 calories a day and the macro breakdown is 200g protein, 200g carbs, 75g fat. Most of the time, I paid close attention to my weekly caloric intake. Some days I would only have 900-1200 calories and save the rest for a day I knew I was going out drinking or there was a special occasion. By the end of the week, I'd have anywhere between 4500-6000 calories to play with which was nice.

*Breakfast*:

Mostly coffee and water. I rarely eat breakfast unless I'm working out in the morning. Usually, I eat an apple pre-workout.

*Lunch 12pm - 4pm*: 

Either a turkey sandwich with mustard and an apple or ground beef with rice and an apple. 

*Dinner 7pm - 9pm*:

Baked chicken breast, roasted brussel sprouts, roasted green beans, grilled asparagus, 2-3 eggs with a slice of cheese, and soybean noodles with black beans, ground beef, a little grated parmesan, and pasta sauce. I usually skip dinner 2-3 times a week.

*Dessert* (always gotta have this):

Peanut butter and honey sandwich with an apple or whatever ice cream I got in my freezer.

*Snacks*:

Apple and protein shake with creatine post-workout. I eat a lot of apples.

That about covers everything. There's still plenty of work I need to do but I'm proud of how far I've come. Hopefully, this helps someone out there! Remember: Progress is slow, consistency is key, eat apples.

1713,Fitness,0,"Excess Skin: How slow should I lose weight? 200lb-130ish goal. I've went through the wiki, searched for some tips/answers on the sub and google doesn't seem to have the answers I'm looking for either so maybe someone can link me something I might have looked over.

I've always been over weight with a big belly since I was a little girl, my highest weight was 260 for about a year in maybe 2015. I lost the 60lbs over the course of a year or two and am now sitting at 196lbs (gained some weight last year due to depression/tragic events).

So I finally found the motivation, diet and exercise plan that works for me and I'm losing up to 2lbs a week (results are in inches and I'm certain it isn't just water weight) I know that, across the board, 1-2lbs/week is the recommended weight loss and I've seen plenty of people lose way more weight faster than the rate I'm going. However, my goal is to lose as healthily and steadily as possible. I'm trying to avoid too much excess skin and generally doing more harm than good.

I'm 5'2"" and my goal is to get down to around 130lbs, it looks like it won't take that long at the rate I'm going but I'm worried that, while I achieve my goal in under a year, I'll have not given my skin enough time to ""adapt"" and all the other concerns with losing weight too quickly.

The majority of my work out is bodybuilding/strength training with 15 minutes of light cardio (incline walking) 6 days a week. My natural diet has always been intermittent fasting, I usually only eat a couple of meals between 12 and 6pm.

I'll give myself a ""maintenance period"" for a couple of weeks where I focus more on maintaining weight as well. I slather on lotion, drink lots of water, and I'm pretty sure my genetics are pretty good as my mom who is nearly 50 just now started to look like she's in her late 30's.

1715,Fitness,0,"Goofy goober in need of assistance Morning yall hope mother winter hasnt bitten ya yet.

Im pretty new to the whole lifting side of exercising, tbh i really have let my self go the past couple of yrs, just in the past month ive started to work towards getting back into decent physical shape. I am now starting to look into the more technical side of lifting and was wondering if i could bounce a couple? Off yall.

Alittle back story
For the first month, I just did 10min internment intensity cardio stepper or treadmill. + a whirl around with the weight machines, reps20,15,10,5 with 5 being my 5rep max then minus 5lbs for each level. Watching form and breathing with each set, and taking a 10 breath break between each set. I also was doing 2 sets of 5close chinups, 5 dip, 5 wide grip, 5 dips. 

I started to see some progress after the first month in terms of strength and endurance on the cardio. After that i started to see little improvement on it. 

On the second month i started to add swimming back into my life, doing that every other day then continuing with the weight machines, i also added regular bench press to the routine, and 2sets of 10 situps, and regular planks 4sets for 30sec with ten vreath breaks between sets.

This last month ive started to try and target specific muscle groups on each days work out, i also add core each day.

1738,Fitness,0,"Question regarding heavy farmer walks Good morning r/fitness, I had a question about going a bit heavier on farmers walks.

My gym has these barbell style bars for farmers walks that weigh about 5lb but can be used to put on a decent amount of weight.

I was experimenting a bit with it, walking 1 or 2 laps of 25 feet, until it was mentioned to me that I should try a quicker pace with small steps. When I was trying to pick up the pace I kept finding myself stepping out too far and turning it into a lunge which would overload my quads and I'd usually collapse pretty soon after. I was working with 215lb on each side and while it felt good to pick up and run with a bit I wanted to make sure I was aware of any issues with the forum of walking with it so I don't injure myself in anyway. I can Deadlift around 460lb right now so because the handles are a little high my goal is two 25ft laps of a 500lb total, ideally without messing myself up in any way. 

Video of me stepping out to far and subsequently crashing with 430lb:

Edit: It was pointed out to me the bars are most likely 25lb so total is 470lb. 

https://imgur.com/flgE9K7

Questions:

1) I Deadlift twice a week and was considering taking it easy on deadlifts and going heavy with this twice a week (my typical Deadlift frequency). Considering that this uses a lot more movement and muscle recruitment, would this be too much or should I try for once a week? 

2) Any tips on avoiding stepping out too far? I feel like it may have been me getting tired and subconsciously trying to get it done quicker. What would be a good goal for foot spacing and pace (slow-quick/small steps/bigger steps) 

3) Structurally speaking, I'm 140lb and 5'8 and have the feeling in the back of my head that I might not feel any strain gradually but might just snap one day. So on that note is there any cues I should be looking at to consider backing off on the weight? 

4) if you watch the video and have any tips or advice I would greatly appreciate it!

Since then my weight usually lingers around 150-155lbs but I look considerably smaller. How long should I expect to get back to where I was?

I have definetly packed on some muscle, and I enjoy the thrill of the sport, so that's good. However..

Our professor is basically doing now the same exercises every single day. Leg day? Well, let's just do squats and lunges 24/7. Oh, we're training glutes? Hip thrusts all day. Biceps? Bench press and curls, please! Abs? Crunches.

Not to mention that my classmates are lazy, and it results on classes that don't even get me pumped.

I know that these are very effective, but I'd like more variation so my body can be challenged.

I've recently tried bodyweight workouts, and they are amazing! I can do them at home and they make me exhausted for once, a rare event at the gym. I'm also noticing a slight more toned body when I do these exercises, which is good.

Is it important to note that the switch to bodyweight will be temporary. I'm planning to hire a personal trainer at a way better gym in my city, so I'm planning to do bodyweight while I'm waiting.

I also don't want a bodybuilder body. I want to be muscular, sure, but not at that level. Somewhere in the middle. And while I know calisthenics is good in doing that, but I had to ask here because of my age and there are also some extra details to note.

If you guys have any bodyweight workouts that target specific muscles, I would love to hear about them. 

And for those that wonder, yes, I'm getting enough protein. Yes, I am getting 7 hours of sleep.

1783,Fitness,0,"Recent Updates to the Wiki This was something that seemed to be fairly well liked [last time around](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/d61uix/recent_additions_to_the_wiki_that_you_may_have/), so we've decided to try to make it a regular thing.

# [Frequently Asked Questions](https://thefitness.wiki/faq/) - Reorganized!

The organization of this page since we launched the external Wiki has been pretty bad, and this is because I was very lazy. We finally got around to breaking the giant fuck-you list out into specific categories so it's easier to navigate.

# [Community Campfires](https://thefitness.wiki/resources/community-campfires/) - Made pretty!

This page has been fleshed out a bit so readers can get a better idea of what the threads cover. We've also gone through a bunch of the FAQ entries and put links to this page there where it's relevant.

# [Guided Tour](https://thefitness.wiki/guided-tour/) - Shiny and new!

As it says on the page, we know there's a lot to digest in the Wiki, especially if you start falling down rabbit holes as it is so very easy to do. The goal with this ""Guided Tour"" page is to help people who are feeling a bit lost find the most important bits of our resources to read over to help them get on track for their goals. Suggestions to help make this page better and more comprehensive are welcome.

# New FAQ: [Why is r/Fitness so focused on “powerlifting” routines?](https://thefitness.wiki/faq/why-is-r-fitness-so-focused-on-powerlifting-routines/)

This is a meta-question that comes up often enough that we decided it warranted having a bit of clarification in the Wiki, and a link to it has been added to the [Strength Training / Muscle Building Routines](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/) page.

# New FAQ: [How do I know how many calories to eat?](https://thefitness.wiki/faq/how-do-i-know-how-many-calories-to-eat/)

This is information that can almost all be found elsewhere in the Wiki already, but this question comes up often enough that we felt it should be a bit easier to find if you're looking specifically and only for this.",recent update wiki fairly liked time r comment d uix recent_additions_to_the_wiki_that_you_may_have decided try make regular thing frequently asked question thefitness wiki faq reorganized organization page launched external wiki pretty bad lazy finally got breaking giant fuck list specific category s easier navigate community campfire thefitness wiki resource community campfire pretty page fleshed bit reader better idea thread cover gone bunch faq entry link page s relevant guided tour thefitness wiki guided tour shiny new say page know s lot digest wiki especially start falling rabbit hole easy goal guided tour page help people feeling bit lost important bit resource read help track goal suggestion help make page better comprehensive welcome new faq r focused powerlifting routine thefitness wiki faq r focused powerlifting routine meta question come decided warranted having bit clarification wiki link added strength training muscle building routine thefitness wiki routine strength training muscle building page new faq know calorie eat thefitness wiki faq know calorie eat information wiki question come felt bit easier looking specifically
1784,Fitness,0,"Why does muscle growth slow as you become more advanced? Is it because further growth is pushing the homeostasis closer to the genetic potential and the body doesn't want to hold onto that much muscle so it slows down the growth, or is it because the first X number of training + repair/growth cycles are better at building muscle?  


 I have always thought it was the former reason but then why do people say they wish they got more out of their first year of training? It's not like they somehow lost gains because it took them 1.5 years to get to intermediate level rather than 1 year because of sub-optimal training, right?",doe muscle growth slow advanced growth pushing homeostasis closer genetic potential body doesn t want hold muscle slows growth x number training repair growth cycle better building muscle thought reason people say wish got year training s like lost gain took year intermediate level year sub optimal training right

She's very petite (about 5'2 and 100lbs) and although she has great endurance, she is lacking in general athleticism which I think would help her a lot with her running in general but especially with hurdles.  She is a novice when it comes to strength/conditioning training but does do a good job of following along when watching others.  Do you think one of the video workout programs would be a good idea for her as winter training to go along with her running?  I was looking at maybe Insanity or P90X type programs.

1787,Fitness,0,"Back squats harder than front squats? I've heard from reading the subreddit and suggestions from a few friends that front squats can be much harder than back squats. It requires more mobility and at the end of the day, it provides the same activation with the front squats focusing a wee bit more on the quads. 

My issue is that I (24/M/168lbs skinny fat towards the heavier side) I find it extremely hard to do back squats. I know for a fact that the actual feat of lifting the weights is not the problem since I'm able to leg press 180 lbs 10x5 while I'm only able to do a 20lbs + bar weight back squat. Even at these low weights, my body tends to go forward and my knees do not reach the perpendicular. For reference, I am able to do a full front squat with almost double the weights 10x4. I can also do a shit ton bodyweight squats with proper posture too. 

I used to go to the gym last year and discontinued due to personal issues. But, I remember facing the exact same issue at that time. I just restarted a month ago and I still haven't been able to figure out a solution for this. If anyone has ever faced a similar issue, or have any suggestions for correcting this please let me know. Thank you and have a great day/night.",squat harder squat heard reading subreddit suggestion friend squat harder squat requires mobility end day provides activation squat focusing wee bit quad issue m lb skinny fat heavier extremely hard squat know fact actual feat lifting weight problem m able leg press lb x m able lb bar weight squat low weight body tends forward knee reach perpendicular reference able squat double weight x shit ton bodyweight squat proper posture used gym year discontinued personal issue remember facing exact issue time just restarted month ago haven t able figure solution faced similar issue suggestion correcting let know thank great day night
1788,Fitness,0,"Can work out lower body reliably but not upper body So I’ve been trying to workout for the last several months following a basic PPL routine but I’ve been having problems following reps with my upper body. Like, with legs I can do 5x5 with a set amount of weight that’s heavy enough to just get 5 reps in each time, and barely finish my final set. But with upper body, I feel like I can’t reach the same reps without lowering the weight. Like it’ll be 8 reps one set, 7 the next, 5 the next etc. is it a matter of lowering the weight as I go, or should I lift for endurance for a while?",work lower body reliably upper body trying workout month following basic ppl routine having problem following rep upper body like leg x set weight s heavy just rep time barely finish final set upper body feel like t reach rep lowering weight like ll rep set matter lowering weight lift endurance
1789,Fitness,0,"Door Frame Bar -- Is it worth it? At the moment I have no weights or gym membership. I am a big cardio guy, really into tennis.

I've thought about buying one of those bars that go into your door frame. I have a few questions:


* Do they damage the door frame/leave scuffs?


* Should I just buy one from amazon or is that better to buy at Target or some local low-cost shop?

* Is there a big difference in a cheap version vs. an expensive one?



* What are the best exercises to do on them? Just pull ups? Reversed or non-reversed palms? (palms facing outward or inward)


* Do I need a tall door frame? I'm 6'1 and I'm wondering if the height of the door frame is important to having success with these.



* Are they worth the money, time, and space taken up?",door frame bar worth moment weight gym membership big cardio guy really tennis thought buying bar door frame question damage door frame leave scuff just buy amazon better buy target local low cost shop big difference cheap version v expensive best exercise just pull ups reversed non reversed palm palm facing outward inward need tall door frame m m wondering height door frame important having success worth money time space taken
