Greetings, 

I have been working out (weightlifting) strenuously for the past 4-5 months. I have seen slight results in my visible muscle mass and even bigger results in my weight lifting capability. I have a friend that has been training me and we divide weekly workouts as follows:

Monday - Arms

Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday - Legs

Wednesday - Chest

Friday - Back

And we do abs and cardio at the end of every workout. 

I have never payed much attention to diet besides the casual ""look at nutrition labels and cringe but eat it anyway."" I don't know if I'm ready to bulk and I really don't want to spend money on meal prepping. To start off I want to start tracking my diet and see what kinds of nutrients I am in taking, which ones I am lacking, and which ones I'm exceeding. Then eventually get into some healthier habits to speed up results and avoiding plateau. 

Is there a specific tool, app, or website you guys use to track your diet? Preferably one that would be personalized and might help signal what I need more or less of. Also, I'd be interested to discover recipes or maybe other subbreddits that focus on healthy eating for those that work out.

,Fitness,"Hi,

**Background:**

I am a 34 year old Male currently weighing 99kg/218 lbs at 6 feet 3 inch / 190cm. My weighing machine estimates me at about 26% body fat. I used to be 108 kg at one point in 2017 which was the most I have ever weighed. I was tired of weighing so much and looking the way I did and so I started working out and counting and cutting calories. I was down to about 85kg/190lbs in August 2018. The workouts were mostly unstructured full body weights about 2-3 times a week and some functional cardio type exercises the other 2-3 days. At that point many things happened and since then I have managed to gain a lot of the weight back.

**Current workout and lifts:**

Currently I am doing the Kinobody Warrior Shred program by Greg Gallagher for the past 3-4 months. However I am eating about 1800-1900 calories only which is below the 2200 recommended in the plan while eating about 160g protein daily. The part that appealed to me about this regime was the fact that it was a 3 day/week program which is usually how much time I am able to spare with my work travel commitments. My work travel involves places where I do not have access to a gym. After having run this program about halfway I am still not sure if this is the best way to go.

Sometime in 2018 I had purchased Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 2nd edition and read it all. However after reading more on /r/fitness and other forums I felt like this program might not be the best idea to go with a cut. Hence I have not tried it yet. I was also looking at the PPL program which many recommended for people starting out but the 6 day/week requirement put me off as I know I won't be able to keep that up.

My current lifts are at:

Flat Bench: 55 kg x 8. 1RM estimate (Strong app): 68

Deadlift: 80 kg x 8 1RM estimate ( Strong app): 99

Squat: 90 kg x 6 1RM estimate ( Strong app): 105

Overhead Press: 50 kg x 6 1RM estimate ( Strong app): 58

**Help needed:**

I feel like there is better more structured approach that I can possibly take to getting fitter and looking better and which is why I am posting here. I have read the wiki multiple times and have gone through all the recommended routines etc. also but am confused which would best apply to me. My goals are predominantly about looking better and not about how much I can lift or how strong I am.

Which program would be most suited to my needs looking at the 3/4 workouts per week limitation? Should I try 5/3/1 or GZCL and stick to it? If yes, which of the variants? Should I try PPL and just do as many workouts as I can per week? Should I just stick to the WSP plan I am currently doing? Do I need to add cardio to my workout regime?

As far as diet goes I think I want to cut till I can get to the 80kg/176 lbs region and then think about bulking up.

,Fitness,"Hey everyone,

I'm pretty inexperienced at weightlifting (I know what I'm doing in the gym I just can't lift much lol) and am looking for a little advice on workouts to build some muscle. I'm 20 years old, 6'0"", 150ish pounds, so obviously pretty skinny. After doing a bit of research it looks like my best bet is going to be bulking up, as it's probably unhealthy to try to lose any weight and I don't have a whole lot of muscle that that would reveal anyways.

I've been going to the gym for the past month or so (about 3 times per week), and usually alternate upper body and lower body lifting followed by some cardio (swimming, rowing machine, biking). I feel good about doing cardio, but my big question is if it's hurting any muscle gains? Is it a waste of time and just burning calories that would be better used to help restore/build my muscles?

Additionally, I looked into a macronutrient calculator ([https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/macronutrients\_calculator.htm](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/macronutrients_calculator.htm)) which tells me I should be consuming about 200 grams of protein per day. That's insane to me. I don't keep track of my diet at all, but I know I'm not eating anywhere near that (probably less than 100g but I don't really know). Am I wasting my time weightlifting if I'm not consuming massive amounts of protein? I'm not really a huge eater, so going crazy with chicken/eggs/yogurt makes me feel like I would just get fat.

,Fitness,"Hey,

Before I begin, I just wanted to share that I think this may be hugely downvoted; however, I do not know of any other subreddits so sorry.

Briefly, my fitness journey began \~12 years ago, just before I entered high school. Prior to that, I was a bit overweight/fat, but my teenage-self knew that girls liked fit guys so I started to workout and eat healthily. Since then, I have been a gym rat, but admittedly one that has been running around kind of ""blind"". Even though I managed to shave \~40lbs from my highest weight back then, and now standing at 5'8/9% BF/145lbs (being short sucks), I still feel like I haven't achieved my desired body, but I don't know what that is.

What I do know is that I don't want to look too bulky - ""a bowling ball"". Additionally, I play \~8-10 hours of basketball per week (mostly after working out).

I currently follow a 6-day training split (basketball isn't factored in). The gym serves as a healthy, positive outlet for me, both physically and mentally, so I spend quite a bit of time there despite my frenzied work and graduate school demands. 

My main focus is to look really good (I have self-proclaimed OCD so even the slightest details matter), while having the capacity to perform in all other areas of life. Also, basketball is huge to me, and despite my shorter stature, I have a nice 3-point shot, which is something I don't want weightlifting to hinder.

Something that is weird to me is working out to ""maintain"", since I always had general goals, whether it was losing fat, weight, or getting tone. 

As I type this, I have no idea what the intentions of this post are. 

Should I curate my own program that addresses what my needs are? For example, hypertrophy in the upper chest, strength in arms/shoulders, hypertrophy in abs, strength in legs, and whatever it may be?

I guess where I am getting at is, can I curate a program that combines both hypertrophy and strength training to specific muscles that I want to work on? Should I just chill a bit back on the gym (I don't really want to do this because I get really lethargic, ultimately affecting all the other things that I have to do).

Additionally, are there specific workouts/routines that are known to bolster the ideal physique?

Idk - this post may be unnecessary lol, but I kind of wanted some more structure.

&lt;p&gt;Should I curate my own program that addresses what my needs are? For example, hypertrophy in the upper chest, strength in arms/shoulders, hypertrophy in abs, strength in legs, and whatever it may be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess where I am getting at is, can I curate a program that combines both hypertrophy and strength training to specific muscles that I want to work on? Should I just chill a bit back on the gym (I don&amp;#39;t really want to do this because I get really lethargic, ultimately affecting all the other things that I have to do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, are there specific workouts/routines that are known to bolster the ideal physique?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk - this post may be unnecessary lol, but I kind of wanted some more structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"Hello everyone.

Recently I have been acquainted with the FST-7 program and have already tried a day or two on it. The program is supposed to emphasize hypertrophy above all else which is my ultimate goal and at the end of working out one muscle section one is supposed to do 7 sets of 8-12 reps. The other sets however typically lists 3-4 sets of 5-8. 

The program is vague on how one should approach these sets however. I am wondering what weight one should shoot for for the different sets? My thought would be the 5-8 would be heavier and the 7 sets of 8-12 would be somewhat lighter but there's no way to tell. 

Overall im receiving conflicting information on how heavy or light the weights are to be with some saying that its supposed to be heavier and other sources saying lighter. Additionally, my guess for the 5-8 sets would be to start lighter and hit 8 then 7 then 6 going marginally heavier? 

Another thing that I am confused about is rest periods. The 7 sets are clear the rest should be no more than 45 seconds between them but the others say 1 minute to 3 minutes. Is this not a bit long? My thought would be that minimal rest is better for hypertrophy.

,Fitness,"Hello fitness people!

Since I began doing this exercise as a part of a programme soon a year ago, I fell in love with it almost right away (everyone has their favourites), but after wondering ""if I'm doing it right and are my results (lifter %) on strengthlevel.com real?"" for several months, I finally decided to ask you guys! As my main focus with fitness is kayaking, it's extra important to me to get my rowing exercises done properly.

Basically what I would like to have confirmed or debunked is the following: the way I see it, based on information online (mainly Youtube ""how-to""-videos) and my personal experience doing the exercise, is that it can be divided into two ways of doing it, with both appear to be considered to be the right way. I'm only describing the part(s) that differ and I would like clarity on, not for instance feet positioning.

In the one case (#1) the movement consists of the elbow doing an arc upwards to be level with the lat and in some cases going higher, so that instead the DB is level with the lat. This to me feels like the movement engages the triceps as well.

On the other hand (#2), another way of doing the exercise appears to be a simple upwards movement of the elbow so that the DB touches the pectoral. This movement to me feels like it engages the biceps as well.

In How-to vid's and in my book(s) for demonstrative purposes the DB used is quite (IMHO) light. In addition, when lifting a heavy DB the size of it makes it impractical to lift it beside the body (case #1)

What I would like to know is

1. Have I misunderstood this exercise completely?
2. If my goal with the exercise is to train my back (targeting the lats), am I doing it right?
3. There isn't two ways of doing the exercise, it's all in my head and I've been obsessing over nothing and wasted your time reading this.

My Favorite workouts are deadlift and squats. I need to work on my bench press. I started with light weights making sure my form was on point and when i felt comfortable i started adding weight. I’m on my last phase of my lean bulk and will be starting my cut next month.  

Diet:
My diet consist of high protein, moderate carbs and fats. I usually eat oats and protein shake for breakfast, grilled chicken breast or tuna + veggies and rice for my 2nd and 3rd meal and i like to eat protein bars as a snack. Also having enough sleep is a key to success as it helps in muscle recovery. 

Thoughts:

To be honest, the hardest thing about working out is not knowing when to start. From my experience, the best time to start is now. And if you stay commited and consistent you will reach your goal. I would like to thank you guys for inspiring me and for helping me reach the best version of my self.

,Fitness,"I'm looking at staring [Jim Wendler's: Building the Monlith](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size) in a couple of months once am happy to switch away from nSuns 5day LP and had a couple of questions regarding exercise changes/choices.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I should preface this by saying that getting stronger and getting bigger are both important to me, however, I would say a lean slightly more towards wanting to focus on gaining mass. Programs that are structured using the 5/3/1 method are more appealing to me because I just enjoy lifting low rep high intensity. I have had a couple of injuries in the past due to being an ego lifting, Gumby look-a-like, but over the last year I have really started getting into a groove and really improving with my lifting. 

&amp;#x200B;

One injury I have had in the past was on my lift hip. I had some tendinitis in my hip which meant I was unable to squat for a long period of time. A month or so ago I decided that I would start squatting again, and only my second back squat session back, I felt the slightest sensation of my hip flaring up again so I thought I would have to ease off the squatting again. Funnily enough, I realised that when I did my accessory front squats on a Thursday, I didn't have the same nagging issues as I did with back squats. Ever since I have replaced all back squatting with front squats, and I have to say I find it so much more enjoyable/comfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of my lack of squatting, my lower body has really started lagging behind my other lifts. I was really really skinny when I started out lifting, and doing little to no legs has really messed me up. My whole lower body is a weak point, but I would say that my glutes and hamstrings are lagging further behind that my quads are. Another weak point (aesthetically) I have is my upper chest. I have made pretty good progress with my bench press (45kg - 85kg) but I would definitely say that my upper chest looks pretty hollow.

&amp;#x200B;

# My Questions 

When switching to BTM, I would like to only do front squats. This will shift the main focus of my leg training to my quads which will be detrimental to my already lagging hamstrings and glutes. Can/should I offset this with the addition of Romanian Deadlifts and/or Hipthrusts? If so, where would you suggest I add them in and with what sort of volume/intensity? I'm having a hard time trying to figure out if this will burn me out, or if it will even really be a problem in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Second. I wouldn't mind changing the flat bench press to incline to help address my lagging upper chest, but I wouldn't want it to effect my progress on flat bench (In terms of 1RM). Has anyone had any experience with only incline benching and if it had any effects on their flat bench 1RM? My main concern is that I lift about 20kg less on incline than flat, so in my head I'm thinking it could possibly reduce my flat bench 1RM (I have no experience in this so I could be wrong)

,Fitness," I started lifting around September time 2019, although I was in good shape beforehand. I wanted to get a little bit bigger, bit mainly just stronger whilst staying lean. My initial 1RMs for each exercise were:

Bench: 57kg (125lbs)

Deadlift: 95kg (210lbs)

Overhead Press: 35kg (77lbs)


I did do squats but I have recently stopped due to knee issues which I do not want to worsen.

For the first couple of months up to Christmas, I ran 5/3/1 for my main lifts and mixed and matched accessory work, including bits of bodyweight various arm work. In terms of diet, I wasn't specifically bulking or cutting but I'd consider my diet to be pretty healthy. By Christmas my 1RMs had progressed to 71 (155), 110 (240) and 45 (100) on bench, deadlift and OHP respectively. 

At this stage I decided to have a go at writing my own programme. 5/3/1 had worked pretty well (although I'm fairly confident in my assumption that almost anything would have worked since I'm so new) so I based it off the same structure. The program is a 3 week cycle and I generally work out three days a week, doing each of my three main lifts twice:

Week 1
5x80%
2-4x85%
1+x90%
3 sets of 5x60-70%

Week 2
5x80%
2-4x85%
1+x95%
3 sets of 5x65-75%

Week 3
5x85%
2-4x90%
1+x100%
3 sets of 5x70-80%

All the percentages are of my 1RM, and where a range of reps or weight is given I judge this by exercise and how my body feels (e.g deadlift sets are usually on the lighter end of the range otherwise can barely walk the next day). I do a variety of accessory work after these lifts, I keep a note and try to keep progression fairly steady. I have a few bodyweight/calisthenics goals in mind as well as just keeping my general conditioning high with this. I've currently been running this for one cycle whilst on a bit of a mini cut to mitigate the damage from Christmas, but at the end of my first three weeks I managed two reps of my max weight on bench and deadlift plus three on OHP.

Here is a pic:  http://imgur.com/a/FQAiCzE

So far I've really enjoyed the ride, and just want to thank the community for giving me the info I needed to get started. I think my biggest weakness is that I haven't yet managed to commit to a long enough period of bulking or even have run the same program for long enough to know what really works for me - but that's a work in progress (I've got a 2 month bulk planned starting February). 

*I also have a question regarding my programs' progression: I plan to increase the weight I lift by 1-5kg on every set (i.e *not* increase my 1RM and recalculate percentages), and for my first cycle am thinking 3kg (6.5lbs) for bench, 4kg (9lbs) for deadlift and 2kg (4.5lbs) for OHP.

And one of the claims is:

&gt;7. Walking is better for our metabolism than going to the gym  
&gt;  
&gt;Engaging in low-level activity across the course of the day is better for regulating your metabolism than engaging small bits of intense but infrequent activity.  
&gt;  
&gt;People tend to overestimate the benefits of going to the gym and pounding out an hour on the treadmill when they’ve been inactive for the rest of the day, says Shane. In fact, he says this behaviour can lead to “exercise induced inactivity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking is better for our metabolism than going to the gym&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engaging in low-level activity across the course of the day is better for regulating your metabolism than engaging small bits of intense but infrequent activity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tend to overestimate the benefits of going to the gym and pounding out an hour on the treadmill when they’ve been inactive for the rest of the day, says Shane. In fact, he says this behaviour can lead to “exercise induced inactivity. Basically, your body is saying you’ve gone and hunted, you’ve got the wildebeest, you’ve killed it, you’re sitting down, you can eat. And your metabolic rate actually drops.”  &lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"I'm a casual lifter that doesn't compete, with a 5RM of 315lbs and I'm thinking of replacing the squats because I don't see what the squat is doing for me.

1. After squats on squat day, my CNS is fried and my lower back is fatigued to the point where I can't do another heavy compound or quality accessory movements. I can only do seated accessories or stuff on the smith because I'm just so tried. 

2. I know the squat works a lot of muscle groups, but I don't feel like it has really improved anything in particular - i.e. rack pulls and hip thrusts have really helped my hip hinge and deadlifts have really helped my hamstrings. 

3. I'm not getting enough focus on my quads and I feel like I'm not getting enough volume because I do 5x5 (sometimes less when I'm going for triples or a single) and again I'm too tired to do quality accessory movements. 

4. I've tried replacing it with safety bar squats, which has helped because I can still do another compound like the rack pull afterwards because the SSB takes some of the stress of your lower back. However I have the same issues as the regular squat.

* Male
* 23 Years Old
* 178 cm (5’10”)
* 68 kg (150 lbs)

I’ll keep this long story short. I used to be very active in high school, mainly in martial arts and running. Once I got out of school, I stop playing sports and never watch what I ate. Before I knew it, I had a gut. My main goal was loose fat, gain muscle, and be more aware of what I’m eating.

#Workout

I decided to go with a full body workout routine, where I did a full body workout 3 times a week. Every day there was an five exercises, one for each category: push, pull, legs, curl, extension. “Push” targeted chest and shoulders. “Pull” targeted the back and shoulders. “Legs” worked all the leg muscles and the core. “Curl” targeted the bicep and forearm. “Extension” targeted the tricep and backarm. 

[Workout Chart](https://imgur.com/5aNLyUz)

**Day A:**

* Run (3 Miles)
* Bench Press (3 x 5-10)
* Barbell Row (3 x 5-10)
* Squat (3 x 5-10)
* Bicep Curl (3 x 5-10)
* Tricep Press (3 x 5-10)

**Day B:**

* Run (3 Miles)
* Incline Bench Press (3 x 5-10)
* Seated Row (3 x 5-10)
* Deadlift (3 x 5-10)
* Hammer Curl (3 x 5-10)
* Cable Pulls (3 x 5-10)

**Day C:**

* Run (3 Miles)
* Dumbbell Press (3 x 5-10)
* Lat Pulldown (3 x 5-10)
* Hack Squat (3 x 5-10)
* Cable Curl (3 x 5-10)
* Overhead Extension (3 x 5-10)

I started with a 3 mile run on the treadmill for a full 30 minute cardio workout. Then I followed up with strength training, doing progressive overload for each exercise around 70%-90% of my maximum rep. If I could do 3 sets of 10 consistently on an exercise, it means it was time to bump up the weight. Strength training took about 30 minutes, which means I spent a total of one hour to one hour and fifteen minutes at the gym. Considering I was only going to the gym 3 days week, this routine provided a perfect work-life balance.

#Diet

I originally tried keto for two weeks, but I was constantly hungry, tired, dizzy, and sometimes I wanted to vomit. I gave up and did some research. I came across The Harvard Food Pyramid (not the same as the FDA Food Pyramid), which gave a simple eating guide that was based on science.  

[Harvard University Nutrition Guide](https://imgur.com/a/ngeHP0H)

* 3+ Serving Of Whole Grain Carbs
* 2-3 Servings of Fruit
* 2-3 Servings of Veggies
* 2+ Servings of Meat 
* 1-2 Servings of Diary
* 1-3 Servings of Nuts
* Include Plant Oils (Such As Olive Oil)
* Use Sparing Added Sugar, Butter, White Bread

This diet is very simple to follow. I reduced my intake on soda, beer, and candy to around once a week. I replaced my white bread with whole grain bread, white rice with brown rice, white pasta with whole grain pasta, and added oatmeal to ensure my diet was high in fiber. Fun fact: Fiber will always keep you full. I eat protein every meal, usually eggs, milk, and/yogurt. I have some sort of meat, whole grain carbs, and veggie for lunch and dinner, with dinner usually having two servings of meat (for protein) and veggies (for vitamins). And I snack on healthy foods in between meals such as nuts, granola bars, and fruit. I always make sure I stay hydrated with water. 

Here is a typical eating day for me. Breakfast: Oatmeal, Eggs, Yogurt, and Banana. Lunch: Tuna Salad Sandwich on whole grain with Broccoli and Orange. Snack: Almonds. Dinner: Two pieces of Chicken Breast, Brown Rice with curry, Sweet Potato, Black Beans, and Mix Veggies. I didn’t count calories, carbs, or macros. Additionally, I didn’t do protein shakes or supplements. I just made sure that I got my servings of food and all of the important nutrition I need would fall into place.  

#Conclusion

Here Are My Current Maximums:

* **Bench Press:** 84 kg (185 lbs)
* **Squat:** 113 kg (250 lbs) 
* **Deadlift:** 104 kg (230 lbs)

Overall, I am really happy with these results. This subreddit gave me a lot of useful information and seeing the transformations post keep me inspired.

,Fitness,"Hi Reddit, my first post ever on here so please bare with.

Male - 22 - 6'2.5 (190cm) - 100kg(\~220lbs)

[BEFORE (ples dont mind my ugly face)](https://imgur.com/a/RpuCLCi)

[AFTER](https://imgur.com/a/7I5LMx3)

**Intro**

Firstly, i've never been bothered about how my body looked, and no one really said anything against how I looked, however, it was always about my strength. I went to a boy school so things got physical there, and my strength was challenged a lot; so much so that people were surprised if I lifted something fairly heavy. So being strong was my aim. I was always active and played football, cycling and jogging a lot, but little to no weight lifting.

I was 18 when I started, which was the year I was going to University, I specifically waited for this year as I would have more free time and be more independent in what I ate and how I lived my life. I lived at my uni campus (2 hour drive away from home).

**2016-2017 - Skinny Noodle**

With little to no research - I started a ""bro split""kinda work out (I hit each body part once a week). I thought I was strong, and to be fair I think I was. I was benching around 50kg for 6/7 reps during the end of 2016. My back was definitely strong (through back rowing, one arm row, pull ups -6reps ). The highest I could deadlift was 90kg. I tried to DL 100kg in front of my uni mates and I kid you not, I nearly passed out.

My diet in 2016 - 2017 was appalling now looking back. I did not track my calories until 6/7 months after I started gym. It was definitely below the recommended. And I ate a lot of processed food. I started my first cut 6/7 months in as I just wanted to look like I had muscle, which was a mistake. My main foods consisted  of:

* Eggs
* chicken
* meatballs
* green veg
* porridge (with a scoop of mass gainer )
* wholemeal bread

In conclusion, 2016 was a massive learning curve for me, spent countless nights watching YouTube videos, researching how the body works, and meals which guaranteed the best gains.

Weighed 78kg

**2017-2018 - The year of the vicious bulk**

After around a year of going through mistakes in mainly my diet; I started to find out what works well for my body, the best routines etc. Major changes I made was body split to PPL(push pull legs). Followed a 5x5 type training. Removed all processed foods apart from shakes. And now incorporated fruit smoothies with a scoop of whey. NOW LET THE BULK BEGIN (6+ month bulk)

Followed a strict PPL. 5 days a week &gt; 2 rest. Then the following week, 6 days a week &gt; 1 rest. Repeat.

I ate 5 meals a day :

* Weetabix with peanut butter
* Wholemeal bread with eggs
* Wholemeal bread, ham and cheese ""toastie"".
* Fruit smoothie with 1 or 2 scoops of whey
* Rice/Pasta with chicken/tuna and veg

I was easily eating around 3300cal a day. Going to the gym 5/6 times a week for months. Slept 8+ hours a day, except the days we went clubbing.

**Until...**

I was incredibly fatigued for at least 5 days. My body was in so much pain and it hurt to even walk long distance, my muscles wanted to retire. I crashed bad; and that is when I found out that you're supposed to take a week break around every 3 months.

My exercises exploded as I was on this bulk - Benched 90kg for 5 reps, squat - 110kg for 5 reps, barbell rows - 60kg. I had to say bye to pull ups as my additional fat made it harder to lift my body weight. Moreover, I barely trained my arms compared to chest for some reason, so I plateaued.

In conclusion - people noticed how strong I was getting, and I had a few compliments of my  transformation compared to the previous year.

Weighed 90kg

**2018 - 2019/20 - Ultimate comeback**

At this point I was well aware of what I was doing in the gym. I knew/know near enough all there is to bodybuilding, and it was just a case of being patient and making sure I met my macros. At this point I had just gone through a cut and I looked shredded than i've ever been. Was even surprised at the veins I had on my abs, but all i wanted to do was to be strong so I went on a soft bulk; 100cal above maintenance and some days just ate maintenance but made sure I had enough protein and fats. Rotated between 4x6 training an 8x3 training around every 2/3 months.

My lifts towards the end of the year were:

* Bench Press - 100kg for 5
* Barbell Row - 90kg for 8
* Deadlift - 210kg for 2
* Squats - 150kg for 5
* OHP 50kg for 8

My diet stayed pretty much the same. 5 Meals a day:

* 2 \* Fruit smoothie with whey (\~500cal each)
* Rice and tuna
* Peanut butter jelly (for the fats ;)
* Dinner

In conclusion - ""we're in the end game now"".

Weighed 100kg

**What I've learned (positives and negatives)**

* Compound movements are the biggest priorty
* Diet before anything - your body reacts to it sooooo easily
* Rest is very very important
* CONSISTENCY
* You actually grow when you're not going to the gym, so your body can finally rebuild what has been teared.
* I sweat so easily it's annoying.

**Next goals**

* 105kg
* Bigger calves (the bane of my life)
* Better cardiovascular health

Thanks for the time.

Recently, through the course of injury rehab, I've become a convert to church of eccentric exercises - currently for calf and hammies.

From my experience, body weight eccentric exercises have been crazy beneficial for my flexibility, muscle hangover, and muscle tension. So I was wondering if people ever incorporate a dedicate eccentric routine to target muscles in the same way a lot of people focus on the big 4 for concentric exercise? and if so, how do you about doing so?

,Fitness,"Really can't seem to google up the answer I'm looking for exactly. I constantly do reverse curls, dips, and push downs. I know I'm getting plenty of long head work, but after 4 years of training I've yet to find an overhead movement that actually activates my long head better than any of those options or just outright feels comfortable.

Skull crushers are decent but incomparable to the previously mentioned, for me at least. Overhead cable work feels awkward no matter how many times I revisit it with a rope or single hand grip, and likewise with overhead DB extensions. All of them always feel awkward and are lackluster in activation for me.

Is there really any reason to revisit overhead work here, or any recommendations from people that were in a similar boat?

**Edit:** if this gets archived and anyone is looking at it.

The consensus seems to be that you can only reach the maximum stretch point of the tricep with overhead movements but none the less if you dont do overhead movements your missing out on a insignificant percent of gains.

My last 2 push days I've revisited skull crushers at the end of the workout with really low weight, 30-50 pounds, and just focused on going really slow like people have mentioned.

I've also added overhead rope extensions, but I am pulling from above the head rather than the floor. Again, at the end, light weight, and really slow.

6’4 (193.04 cm)

295lbs (133kg) to 224lbs (101.6 kg)

[Here’s a pic but I’m really awkward for photos so don’t mind the strange faced selfie](https://imgur.com/nD8LJVd)

This has been one of the longest years of my life but not even because of the weight loss. I wanted to make a mini post on how my year has affected me besides just my weight. These are all the things that I did a little air fist bump because it was such an annoyance to me. 

At the start of my weight loss journey I focused on cardio and did some basic strength machines, I did these 4 to 5 times a week. When I started, I sucked at running, I played football and threw in track, so I was only taught how to lift and never focused on extended running. The first month was me just working my way up to 3.1 miles because I wanted to start running in 5ks. I think to work for a goal that seemed more easily achievable at the time rather than just focusing on losing weight helped in the beginning. I ran a lot and eventually I began to enjoy it. I got to the point where 3.1 miles (5km) in 30 min, was no longer soul sucking, around that time my weight plateaued. That’s when I began running 5 miles to toughen my workout and that was where I went wrong. I learned that pushing yourself the absolute limit is not the only way to go. I was at the gym for almost 2 hours an hour for running and an hour of machines and I wasn’t losing as much weight as I usually did. 

It wasn’t until last August where I decided to look at what I ate a bit more. Like I said earlier, in Football as a lineman I was told to “eat eat eat”, “be an animal”, “get huge”, and was led to an unhealthy diet. I started limiting my portion sizes to just be smaller. At this time my weight plummeted, I was losing around 10 pounds (4.5kg) a month and I didn’t even count calories, I just started to think, I don’t need that much. I only started counting calories a couple of months back because I think I’ve gotten to the point where my body doesn’t have an unlimited amount of energy anymore, some days it was incredibly hard to finish a run and I just felt shitty. So, I started to make sure I eat around 1300 to 1500 calories a day and eat a little more before I work out. 

I wanted to list some little accomplishments that seem small but was huge to me. 

· I sweat less when running. I would sweat for almost an hour after running, now it stops immediately.

· All my clothes from middle school fit me now, so now I have some extra clothes.

· Some girls flirted with me at a party, that felt nice.

· I catch my breath much faster than I did before, IDK if it's possible to not feel winded walking up a huge hill to class.

· I can see muscles now especially my arms and back

· I look a lot better.

Now here are some things that I don’t like about my new healthy lifestyle

· I have my meals thought up for the entire week, a random friend’s trip to get food stresses me out now.

· Most of my clothes don’t fit and as a college student, I can’t just buy new clothes.

· Even though I lost so much weight I feel like I’m not as satisfied as I thought I would be. 

· Seeing my weight loss slowed down is slightly disheartening.

· It’s the minority but I do have some friends that make me feel bad for not eating with them

· I kind of feel flimsy now, I used to “feel” big and strong.

· I only recently have gotten back into lifts but I’m really weak now.

· On some subreddits I follow, I get a little jealous when I see someone lose so much more weight than I, some people are losing over 100 pounds in a year wtf.

· Loose skin, Nuff said.

What are my next goals?

· I want to get to 210 than evaluate on how much more I should lose.

· I want to get back into my lifts and gain more muscle so I can feel strong again.

· I want to run more 5k’s and get below 25 min.

· Don’t fall back into a bad diet but I doubt I will again.",t2_1kd13uhm,False,,0,False,My one-year Fitness journey – 295 to 224,[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_ep4v2s,False,dark,,public,1251,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1251,,False,,1579179492.0,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1579136308.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;M 21&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/nD8LJVd""&gt;Here’s a pic but I’m really awkward for photos so don’t mind the strange faced selfie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been one of the longest years of my life but not even because of the weight loss. I wanted to make a mini post on how my year has affected me besides just my weight. These are all the things that I did a little air fist bump because it was such an annoyance to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of my weight loss journey I focused on cardio and did some basic strength machines, I did these 4 to 5 times a week. When I started, I sucked at running, I played football and threw in track, so I was only taught how to lift and never focused on extended running. The first month was me just working my way up to 3.1 miles because I wanted to start running in 5ks. I think to work for a goal that seemed more easily achievable at the time rather than just focusing on losing weight helped in the beginning. I ran a lot and eventually I began to enjoy it. I got to the point where 3.1 miles (5km) in 30 min, was no longer soul sucking, around that time my weight plateaued. That’s when I began running 5 miles to toughen my workout and that was where I went wrong. I learned that pushing yourself the absolute limit is not the only way to go. I was at the gym for almost 2 hours an hour for running and an hour of machines and I wasn’t losing as much weight as I usually did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until last August where I decided to look at what I ate a bit more. Like I said earlier, in Football as a lineman I was told to “eat eat eat”, “be an animal”, “get huge”, and was led to an unhealthy diet. I started limiting my portion sizes to just be smaller. At this time my weight plummeted, I was losing around 10 pounds (4.5kg) a month and I didn’t even count calories, I just started to think, I don’t need that much. I only started counting calories a couple of months back because I think I’ve gotten to the point where my body doesn’t have an unlimited amount of energy anymore, some days it was incredibly hard to finish a run and I just felt shitty. So, I started to make sure I eat around 1300 to 1500 calories a day and eat a little more before I work out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to list some little accomplishments that seem small but was huge to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I sweat less when running. I would sweat for almost an hour after running, now it stops immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· All my clothes from middle school fit me now, so now I have some extra clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Some girls flirted with me at a party, that felt nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I catch my breath much faster than I did before, IDK if it&amp;#39;s possible to not feel winded walking up a huge hill to class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I can see muscles now especially my arms and back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I look a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here are some things that I don’t like about my new healthy lifestyle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I have my meals thought up for the entire week, a random friend’s trip to get food stresses me out now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Most of my clothes don’t fit and as a college student, I can’t just buy new clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Even though I lost so much weight I feel like I’m not as satisfied as I thought I would be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Seeing my weight loss slowed down is slightly disheartening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· It’s the minority but I do have some friends that make me feel bad for not eating with them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I kind of feel flimsy now, I used to “feel” big and strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I only recently have gotten back into lifts but I’m really weak now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· On some subreddits I follow, I get a little jealous when I see someone lose so much more weight than I, some people are losing over 100 pounds in a year wtf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Loose skin, Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are my next goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I want to get to 210 than evaluate on how much more I should lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I want to get back into my lifts and gain more muscle so I can feel strong again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I want to run more 5k’s and get below 25 min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Don’t fall back into a bad diet but I doubt I will again.&lt;/p&gt;

Note: English is not my first language so please try to ignore the grammatical errors and correct me so that I can improve. Thanks. 

I Started going to the gym on 31 Dec' 2018 and today it feels like I have actually achieved something in my life. Gym became my new life, never skipped a single day and never skipped a good night's sleep. Lots of mistakes were made and I learnt a lot from them.

**Athletic background and genetics** 

Played football for 8 years straight from the age of 8 to 16. 

My mom and day are very fit. My father was in the army when I was born and my mother has always been slim (5'3"" Under 50 KG probably). 

**Diet** 

It was so difficult to calculate the calorie intake because I always ate whatever my mom cooked at home but anyway I did it one day. It turned out to be 2700-3000 which I am pretty sure is definitely not accurate. 

About the protein, I drink 800-1000 ml of milk everyday, and I get the rest of my protein from pulses, eggs (10 egg whites per day, started eating eggs from march), nuts, peanut butter and whey protein 25 gram scoop post workout and 15 gram scoop after waking up.

My diet game has always been week. Even after joining the gym I didn't eat much nutrient rich food. Sometimes I did sometimes I did not. To make up for my nutrient low diet I ate 5-6 times a day, 3 main meals and the rest being snacks (Heavily peanut buttered breads with 300ml of milk, eggs, etc) or sometimes proper meals. My main source of protein was always Milk, Yogurt (homemade), egg whites, pulses, etc. 

**Supplements** 

I never took any other supplement other than Protein and Creatine. 

I started using Whey Protein and creatine from June - July. In Oct I started taking Isolate Protein. Right now I am using Whey and stopped the intake of creatine.

**Training and mistakes** (mostly mistakes)

I trained single body part everyday and I still do that now. I only did the exercises that the Gym trainer told me.

I mostly exercised with the friends that I made at the gym. 

I started training my abs from March and have been training them everyday since then.  

In September I started to realise how bad (not so effective) exercises I have been doing since the beginning. In October I COMPLETELY changed my training schedule and started to understand how the body actually works. Until November I didn't even know which body part the exercises I used to do targeted.  

One of the biggest mistakes that I made was that I never did many compound movement exercises like Deadlift, weighted squats and Overhead press. I started these exercises in mid October and these are my current numbers: 

Numbers now vs numbers when I started in October

**Note** - The numbers below include the weight of the barbell. The barbell I use in every lift weighs 20 KG. 

**Deadlift - 150 KG × 2 rep max** from 110 KG 

**Overhead Press - 60 KG × 6 rep max** from 30 KG (I just realised I fucked up while posting in other subs. I calculated the weight of the barbell and only the weight of the plates on one side, totalling to 40KG. That's probably why everyone was  confused about my OHP being so low).

**Weighted Squats - 140 KG × 4 rep max** from 90 KG (Note: Before ever doing weighted squats I used to do Leg Press every week and my highest was 280 KG × 4 Reps). 

**Bench press - 90 KG × 6 rep max**  (Note:  I train my chest on Saturday and I am just so worn out from all the work and other things. Also, I do supersets while benching. I am pretty sure I can do 1 rep of 110 KG or maybe more)

Looking back at how used to train it was just horrible. Sometimes the sets per body part used to go 30+ and this was repeated so so many times. 

Also, I never ever did cardio even for 5 mins. 

My current training schedule is: 

Monday - [Back](https://youtu.be/eE7dzM0iexc) + Middle and Lower traps *(Y reverse prone raises and)*  w/Deadlift, Lower abs

Tuesday - [Shoulder](https://youtu.be/jv31A4Ab4nA) + Upper traps *(Barbell front and rear shrugs and Dumbbell side shrugs)* , Obliques 

Wednesday - [Legs](https://youtu.be/RjexvOAsVtI) w/Weighted Squats, Abs 

Thursday - [Triceps](https://youtu.be/tMyFe-IL7Ks) + Reverse inclined Kickback and Skull crusher, Lower abs

Friday - [Biceps](https://youtu.be/gozU3CUIizs) + Middle and Lower traps *(Standing cable Y raise and Reverse prone T raise)*, Obliques

Saturday - [Chest](https://youtu.be/89e518dl4I8) + Legs w/leg press, abs

I divided the same leg workout to two days and added extra exercises for calves each day.

Sets and reps - I only do 3 sets of each exercise (even if in the video it's mentioned 4 sets) and my rep range is 12, 10 and 8 with increasing weight in the next set. Before October I used to do 4 sets of each exercise and 15, 12, 10 and 8 reps. 

I train 6 days a week. 1.5 - 2 hours each day.

It took me a week to come up with this schedule, it's probably not the best but it's perfect for me right now. 

**Misc**

When I went to the gym I weighted 57 KG and now I weigh 73 KG.

I tried doing pull-ups on my first day and I was only able to do 3 half-assed pull-ups. But now I can do 30 (Max 35) clean pull-ups. I have been doing them in every two days since the first day.

People in other thread were really doubting how I got such shoulders because my OHP is so low and were accusing me of using roids. I have been doing dumbbell overhead press (25 KG max × 8 reps) since I started training shoulders. 

I did not use any roids or anything. It's upto you whether you want to believe it or not. 

I will only keep on pushing and get only better.

Thanks to my gym buddies for getting me where I am today.

In October I COMPLETELY changed my training schedule and started to understand how the body actually works. Until November I didn&amp;#39;t even know which body part the exercises I used to do targeted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest mistakes that I made was that I never did many compound movement exercises like Deadlift, weighted squats and Overhead press. I started these exercises in mid October and these are my current numbers: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers now vs numbers when I started in October&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; - The numbers below include the weight of the barbell. The barbell I use in every lift weighs 20 KG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadlift - 150 KG × 2 rep max&lt;/strong&gt; from 110 KG &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overhead Press - 60 KG × 6 rep max&lt;/strong&gt; from 30 KG (I just realised I fucked up while posting in other subs. I calculated the weight of the barbell and only the weight of the plates on one side, totalling to 40KG. That&amp;#39;s probably why everyone was  confused about my OHP being so low).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weighted Squats - 140 KG × 4 rep max&lt;/strong&gt; from 90 KG (Note: Before ever doing weighted squats I used to do Leg Press every week and my highest was 280 KG × 4 Reps). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bench press - 90 KG × 6 rep max&lt;/strong&gt;  (Note:  I train my chest on Saturday and I am just so worn out from all the work and other things. Also, I do supersets while benching. I am pretty sure I can do 1 rep of 110 KG or maybe more)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at how used to train it was just horrible. Sometimes the sets per body part used to go 30+ and this was repeated so so many times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I never ever did cardio even for 5 mins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current training schedule is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday - &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/eE7dzM0iexc""&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt; + Middle and Lower traps &lt;em&gt;(Y reverse prone raises and)&lt;/em&gt;  w/Deadlift, Lower abs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday - &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/jv31A4Ab4nA""&gt;Shoulder&lt;/a&gt; + Upper traps &lt;em&gt;(Barbell front and rear shrugs and Dumbbell side shrugs)&lt;/em&gt; , Obliques &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday - &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/RjexvOAsVtI""&gt;Legs&lt;/a&gt; w/Weighted Squats, Abs &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday - &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/tMyFe-IL7Ks""&gt;Triceps&lt;/a&gt; + Reverse inclined Kickback and Skull crusher, Lower abs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday - &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/gozU3CUIizs""&gt;Biceps&lt;/a&gt; + Middle and Lower traps &lt;em&gt;(Standing cable Y raise and Reverse prone T raise)&lt;/em&gt;, Obliques&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday - &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/89e518dl4I8""&gt;Chest&lt;/a&gt; + Legs w/leg press, abs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I divided the same leg workout to two days and added extra exercises for calves each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sets and reps - I only do 3 sets of each exercise (even if in the video it&amp;#39;s mentioned 4 sets) and my rep range is 12, 10 and 8 with increasing weight in the next set. Before October I used to do 4 sets of each exercise and 15, 12, 10 and 8 reps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I train 6 days a week. 1.5 - 2 hours each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a week to come up with this schedule, it&amp;#39;s probably not the best but it&amp;#39;s perfect for me right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went to the gym I weighted 57 KG and now I weigh 73 KG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried doing pull-ups on my first day and I was only able to do 3 half-assed pull-ups. But now I can do 30 (Max 35) clean pull-ups. I have been doing them in every two days since the first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in other thread were really doubting how I got such shoulders because my OHP is so low and were accusing me of using roids. I have been doing dumbbell overhead press (25 KG max × 8 reps) since I started training shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not use any roids or anything. It&amp;#39;s upto you whether you want to believe it or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will only keep on pushing and get only better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my gym buddies for getting me where I am today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. &lt;/p&gt;

Fast forward a few years and I'm still exercising 4/5 days a week with jiu-jitsu and now an Airdyne bike. I switched to an Airdyne as the running was taking its toll on my knees, ankles and hips. I have a tendency to give it everything every time. I was also diagnosed with a nerve condition. I'm always in some type of discomfort and some days are worse than others.  Sometimes I will take a week off the Airdyne and only teach my Brazilian jiu-jitsu class and not roll in it (not grapple). I switch up the amount I train and the days off based on how my nerve condition feels.

I've always done my Treadmill and Airdyne at home when the kids went to bed or they played. They watch and understand how committed I am to exercise and they now are high level Cheerleaders for their age groups. Last year they were on the same team and they won plenty of competitions and worlds.

Here's my question after my ""too much information explanation"".

I've been giving it everything I got on my Airdyne but my improvements are painstakingly slow.  Its been 3 years and I want the gains in calories burned to improve quicker. I use the calories burned simply as a marking tool for gauging my output.

Here's a few of my rides:

3min warm up, 20sec work, 10 secs rest, 8 sets, 5min cool down at a decent pace once I kind of recover from the Tabata

3min warm up, 10min as hard as I can ride

3min warm up 5mins all out, 2 min rest 5min all out, 2min rest 5min all out (doing this as it simulates World Brazilian jiu-jitsu masters divisions match length)

Any ideas to help me increase my output? More carbs, more protein, more rest, any input would be great.

,Fitness,"I'm returning to fitness after falling off the wagon.  Honestly the only thing I care about is cardio.  Weight loss is a nice side benefit since it makes it lighter on my knees, but my main goal is simply getting enough cardio in.  So I started a C25K program like many do then kept going to a 10K goal.  I'm now up to 55 min runs.

I looked at the [r/c25k faq](https://old.reddit.com/r/C25K/wiki/faq).  I know it's not gospel, but two answers stuck out to me:

#### Should I skip rest days?

&gt; No. Assuming a M/W/F running schedule, T/Th/S/Su should be observed rest days. These are your sabbath days of running. Upper body work, cross training, and calisthenics are all okay during three of these days.

#### Can I reduce the number of rest days between weeks?

&gt; Yes, instead of having 2 rest days between weeks, it's fine to reduce it to only one.

OK... all clear so far.  In any month I can choose to run on all the ***odd numbered days*** and ""cross train"" on all the ***even numbered days***.  This is exactly what I do.  So, right now, I run for ~55 min on odd days and swim for ~55 min (don't judge) on even days.

I feel fine and my heart rate stays in the correct band for my (advancing / M49) age.  Despite all of this my fitness tracker is chastising me continually for doing too much anaerobic cycles.  Perhaps it's just an overly concerned AI.  But I feel I should check myself.

**My diet:**  I aimed for 2500-3000 calories a day but that was never consistent. I  never tracked carbs or fat but with my dirty bulk mentality I was  definitely taking in enough. Only thing consistent in my diet was 6 eggs  each morning for breakfast and Peanut butter sandwiches for snacks and  I'd normally down a protein shake after gym. Eggs, peanut butter and  milk are absolute super foods for teenagers trying to bulk... cheap and  tasty. As a teen who doesn't have complete control over my diet due to  money, this was easily the hardest part of gaining.

**Routine for the first 5 months:**  Had no idea what the heck I was doing at first and pretty much only  trained arms and chest. Eventually I ran a bro split I made myself after  copying the types of exercises fellow gym bros were doing. This  actually gave me nice progress but I ended up over training and not  allowing my muscle groups to recover properly.

**Routine for the last 7 months:** I customized my own 3 day PPL as follows

**Push:**

Bench 5x5

Overhead press 4x8-12

Tricep push downs 4x12

Incline bench 4x6

Skull crushers 4x12

Lateral DB raise 4x12

Decline cable fly's 4x12

**Pull**

Pull ups 3x till failure

Chest supported rows 4x8-12

Hammer curls 4x12

Lat pull downs chin up grip 4x12

Bent over rows 4x6-8

Barbell curls 4x8-12

Face-pulls 4x12

**Legs:**

I  did both squats and dead lifts on leg day one after the other. One week  I'd do low rep range high weight and the next I'd do lower weight  higher rep range. 4x3-5 or 4x6-12

Leg extension/Leg curl superset 4x12 of each

Standing calf raises 3x15

Seated calf raises 3x15

**Main lifts progress**

Bench: 40kg-80kg

Squat:  Was scared of squats for the first few months so I stuck to leg press  but I would've guessed maybe 50kg? Currently at 85kg

Dead lift: 80kg-130kg

My workouts are 2 hours long. Now before you ask, yes, this kind of intensity kicked my ass the first month I started working out. DOMS were over a week long, but once I powered through it I stopped feeling them and it's been smooth sailing ever since. I only had one deload week 3 months in but I didn't quite feel like I needed it that much.

---

Diet:

---

3500 kcal a day. My diet mostly consisted of the same stuff for the entire 6 months because I truly don't eat for enjoyment. I lift for a purpose (RIP Rich Piana) (and I guess because I'm way too lazy to cook, lol).

Greek Yoghurt

Oats

Fried Eggs

Cashews

Cheddar cheese

Rice / Buckwheat

Protein shakes (2x a day) that consist of banana, peanut butter, milk, chia seeds and mass gainer (half a serving).

---

Additional supplements: Creatine (3g). Pre-workout (350mg caffeine).

---

I know I still look like a DYEL skeleton compared to most of you but I'm quite happy with my noob gains so far. And for such a ""dirty"" bulk I didn't pack on as much fat as I thought I would.

Ever since I started lifting, I've been obsessed, so I'm going to keep on lifting until I reach the natty limit, whatever it takes. We're all gonna make it, brahs.

Now to reach 70kg until next year.

,Fitness,"I work out at the same gym franchise every time. However, since I travel, I am often hopping from one location to another. I figured this wouldn't be a problem since 90% of the locations have identical machines, but wow, I am finding that there is a 10 - 15% variance in what I can lift from one location to another, and I don't understand this. 

Location A - 180 lbs

Location B - 155 lbs

I even tried going back to location A 3 weeks later when I returned, and sure enough, I could put 180 on there, whereas I was struggling with 155 at location B.  Same machine, and same brand even.

,Fitness,"Hi All, 

So, I've recently learned the advantages of 'leaving one in the tank' and seen how it can positively impact my overall performance. 

Particularly, I recently realised I **haven't**  been applying this to my pullups. 

I've been pushing for max on all of my 4 sets. So for example, a typical day looks like:

8 Reps, 7 Reps, 6 Reps, 5 Reps 

But, I recently read some advice which recommends leaving myself with some energy. So for example, next week I will start by  trying to hit a consistent 6x4. Then maybe aim for 7, 7, 6, 6 etc and work my way up like so.

To my limited knowledge about this, the main idea is to burn fat, become leaner, and also maintain or gain muscle all at the same time.

Can your body be in an anabolic and catabolic state at the same time? Is anabolic fasting scientifically proven to work or just another marketing scheme? I'd appreciate any references and studies as well.

I am currently on week 3 and I was going to prep my week 4 rep/weight scheme but I don't know what it is.

In the book it only shows up to week 3 where it is a 75%x5,  85%x3 ,95%x1. So for week 4 where do I get my percentages do I just go back to week 1s 3x5 structure ? Do I not need to add weight? Am I missing something in the book?

&lt;p&gt;I am currently on week 3 and I was going to prep my week 4 rep/weight scheme but I don&amp;#39;t know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book it only shows up to week 3 where it is a 75%x5,  85%x3 ,95%x1. So for week 4 where do I get my percentages do I just go back to week 1s 3x5 structure ? Do I not need to add weight? Am I missing something in the book? &lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"My primary form of exercise is crossfit, so I was wondering if anyone here had advice on programming GZCL to sub in some Olympic lift training in place of benching.

I train 4x per week at a crossfit gym, doing the class then staying after for supplemental strength training (sicne the dedicated str training in crossfit can be few and far between depending on the programming block). As such I cannot do any moves that involve isolation machines, as they simply aren't available. Other than the 4 day split and need to center around barbell/dumbell and bodyweight movements, I really don't have any restrictions, so open to any advice.

Also I am not a games athlete or looking to do anything like that, just someone who enjoys resistance training and the oly lifts, so wanting to maximize carry over potential for the work I put in.

I am running 5/3/1 currently during a cut, but would like to switch it up once I start lean bulking, and GZCL seems like a natural evolution from 5/3/1. There are basically no horizontal pressing movements in Crossfit, so as a ""sport application"", bench and its variants do nothing for me. I'd much rather tailor towards squatting, deadlift, ohp, and oly moves. The GZCL blog on application and adaptation encouraged tailoring the programming to your needs, but I didn't see any existing templates that had Olympic lifts integrated.

Was thinking something along the lines of:

* M T1 - Back Squat / Tu T1 - Snatch / Tr T1 - Deadlift - F T1 - Clean and Jerk.
* T2 - Lots of OHP and Front Squats, Deadlift assistance, Barbell hip thruts.
* T3 - Dips, pullups, lunges, etc.

I REALLY want to start a thorough home exercise regime. I've been losing weight for the past year and going to the gym regularly but it's becoming increasingly difficult to actually make it to the gym with anxiety issues, losing my car and taking on a new job. I want to purchase some home exercise equipment to continue my routine and invest further in my health and fitness but I'm unsure what I could realistically get given the tiny amount of space I have available to me.

My room is roughly 335cm (W) by 268cm (H) and I have the following pieces of furniture:

* Drawer - 80cm (W) by 50cm (H)
* Cupboard - 55cm (W) by 80cm (H)
* Table - 120cm (W) by 60cm (H)
* **Rough diagram of my room layout illustrating: https://i.imgur.com/FrD0G4I.png**

This leaves me with roughly 245cm (W) by 135cm (H) of open floor space plus a little bit extra around some of the furniture. My budget for this is probably in the couple to few hundred pound range, I'm willing to spend a bit to get what I need to get started but I am on a budget. Also the diagram above is pretty rough but I try to pad everything so I'm not over estimating the free space available.

In terms of my fitness goals, I want to improve my general fitness and get more muscular. So I want to increase my endurance, flexibilty, strength, you name it.

I know everyone says you should stick to the same program when going from a bulk to a cut, but I was running a modified ivysaur 448 with a lot of added accessory volume because I was just trying to get as meaty and strong as possible.

Started out at 100lbs but I was lifting for 3months on ICF 5x5 In the before picture. From then till now I use the reddit PPL with some additional volume and modifications. I dirty bulked till 125-130lbs and have been doing many mini bulk and cuts and recomps(plateauing super hard basically for like a year).

I eat 2700cals to bulk and track my protein to make sure I get 130-150g a day and then it's anything really.

I'm really trying to take this more seriously so I'm going to be training and eating a lot more rigorously now to take my physique to the next level.

Routine:

**Push: Bench press or Incline bench press 5x5**

**Flat dumbbell bench press or incline dumbbell press 3x8-12**

**Decline dumbbell press 3x8-12**

**Overhead press 3x5**

**Dumbbell shoulder press 3x8-12**

**Single arm cable triceps pulldown 3x8-12**

**Overhead dumbbell triceps extension 3x8-12**

**Lateral raises 6x15-20**

**Pull: Deadlifts or rack pulls 3x5**

**Barbell rows 3x5**

**Weighted pullups 3x8-12**

**Cable seated row or seated high row machine 3x8-12**

**Face pulls 5x15-20**

**Barbell Curls 4x8-12**

**Hammer Curls 4x8-12**

**Straight arm pulldowns 3x8-12**

**Legs: Barbell Squats 5x5**

**Hamstring leg curl 3x8-12**

**Leg press 3x8-12**

**Hip abductor machine 3x8-12**

**Weighted lunges 3x8-12**

**Hyperextensions 2x15**

**Calf raises 5x15-20**

If I can hit the upper limit of the rep range through all my sets with good form, I increase the weight. Usually 5lbs for bench press and overhead press and 10lbs for squats and deadlifts. Accessories I just jump to the next stack on a machine or the next set of dumbbells. I chose the PPL routine because I was getting bored with stronglifts and wanted something more hypertrophy focused so I looked around and found the reddit PPL. I tried it out and fell in love with it. Throughout my time I've adjusted stuff based on what works for me and added more volume as the standard template was not providing me enough stimulus and I was cruising through those workouts.

**Diet:**

Breakfast: 4 eggs with spinach, peppers, mushroom, onion omelette style and 60g oats with 1/2 cup assorted berries - 400ish cals

Snack: Banana and protein shake - 200 cals

Lunch: 2 naan with whatever my mom cooked, usually veggies or stew or lentils and a protein shake - 600cals

Dinner: same as above - 600cals

Dinner #2: same as above - 600cals

Before bed meal: 125g icelandic greek yogurt, 2tbspn peanut butter, banana, and 2 caramel choc chip rice cakes - 400 cals

Total is around 2800cals, \~150g of protein

I only track calories and protein but I usually eat a lot of carbs in my diet because I found that they digest quickly for me allowing me to reach my calorie goals. I also function better with carbs as my performance in the gym goes up and I look fuller.

Lift numbers are 5x5 as I don't do 1rm.

Overhead Press: 85lbsx5

Bench: 175lbsx5

Squat: 185lbsx5

Deadlift: 275lbsx5

Going forward I'm going to stick with the PPL program and I believe I can still progress linearly for a little while as long as I'm eating correctly. As soon as I can't progress linearly I'm going to switch to 5/3/1 progression for main lifts. For my diet I'm going to stick with a lean bulk at 2700-2800 cals and slowly increase the calories as my weight increases to make sure I'm still able to build muscle and increase strength.",t2_md7qr,False,,0,False,"M/22/5'5"" 110lbs to 132lbs in 2 years progress",[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_ek8t3s,False,dark,,public,687,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,687,,False,,1578260594.0,,[],{},,True,,1578231554.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://imgur.com/a/HTeApPy""&gt;http://imgur.com/a/HTeApPy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started out at 100lbs but I was lifting for 3months on ICF 5x5 In the before picture. From then till now I use the reddit PPL with some additional volume and modifications. I dirty bulked till 125-130lbs and have been doing many mini bulk and cuts and recomps(plateauing super hard basically for like a year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat 2700cals to bulk and track my protein to make sure I get 130-150g a day and then it&amp;#39;s anything really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really trying to take this more seriously so I&amp;#39;m going to be training and eating a lot more rigorously now to take my physique to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push: Bench press or Incline bench press 5x5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat dumbbell bench press or incline dumbbell press 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decline dumbbell press 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overhead press 3x5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dumbbell shoulder press 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single arm cable triceps pulldown 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overhead dumbbell triceps extension 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lateral raises 6x15-20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull: Deadlifts or rack pulls 3x5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbell rows 3x5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weighted pullups 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cable seated row or seated high row machine 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Face pulls 5x15-20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbell Curls 4x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hammer Curls 4x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight arm pulldowns 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legs: Barbell Squats 5x5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hamstring leg curl 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leg press 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hip abductor machine 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weighted lunges 3x8-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyperextensions 2x15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calf raises 5x15-20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can hit the upper limit of the rep range through all my sets with good form, I increase the weight. Usually 5lbs for bench press and overhead press and 10lbs for squats and deadlifts. Accessories I just jump to the next stack on a machine or the next set of dumbbells. I chose the PPL routine because I was getting bored with stronglifts and wanted something more hypertrophy focused so I looked around and found the reddit PPL. I tried it out and fell in love with it. Throughout my time I&amp;#39;ve adjusted stuff based on what works for me and added more volume as the standard template was not providing me enough stimulus and I was cruising through those workouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast: 4 eggs with spinach, peppers, mushroom, onion omelette style and 60g oats with 1/2 cup assorted berries - 400ish cals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snack: Banana and protein shake - 200 cals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch: 2 naan with whatever my mom cooked, usually veggies or stew or lentils and a protein shake - 600cals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner: same as above - 600cals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner #2: same as above - 600cals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before bed meal: 125g icelandic greek yogurt, 2tbspn peanut butter, banana, and 2 caramel choc chip rice cakes - 400 cals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total is around 2800cals, ~150g of protein&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only track calories and protein but I usually eat a lot of carbs in my diet because I found that they digest quickly for me allowing me to reach my calorie goals. I also function better with carbs as my performance in the gym goes up and I look fuller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lift numbers are 5x5 as I don&amp;#39;t do 1rm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overhead Press: 85lbsx5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bench: 175lbsx5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squat: 185lbsx5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadlift: 275lbsx5&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"Stats : 6'1 / 230lbs / 19 years old

Before and after photos : [https://imgur.com/a/JRm2pXN](https://imgur.com/a/JRm2pXN)

My stomach is tucked in my underwear in the image above, here's an image with it not tucked so everyone can see : [https://imgur.com/XHTAG0C](https://imgur.com/XHTAG0C)

Note\* : I have had gastric bypass done at the age of 15 that helped me get down to 250lbs, seeing how I had stopped losing weight and did not like my physique, I began eating properly and hitting the gym. I also had my gyno and some loose skin removed from my chest in February 2019. Had gyno ever since I was 13. No steroids were used in the making.

Diet :

Since my stomach had expanded to a point where I could eat like how I used to, I had one goal in mind, to get as jacked as possible. Started to use a calorie calculator, and tracked what I ate. I had a healthy diet which is high in protein, carbs and low in fats accompanied with veggies. Whichever calculator you use, it will give you a close estimate to how much you need to eat in order to gain or lose weight, the rest is trial and error until you figure out what works for you. Everyone's metabolism is different. All meals included either chicken,beef,fish and eggs accompanied with rice,pasta,bread or any other carb source I had. Also a lot of low sugar ketchup because It makes it go down easy. You can do it however you like, I am more comfortable restricting myself rather than doing IIFYM (if it fits your macros) or any other diet.

Workouts :

Most people don't do enough sets and reps. You need to take the muscle to a point of failure to cause it to grow. If the goal was to do 12 reps for that set, you shouldn't be able to do 13-14 reps (with proper form). That means the muscle has failed and you cannot perform the movement. I include drop sets and half reps when I hit that point. I drop the weight by 20-25% for dropsets. Lets say you do 100lbs for the lat pull down, once you finish your first set, you drop down to 80lbs and do reps till failure. Below Is the exact workout routine I have had since becoming knowledgeable on effective training, I have not stopped getting stronger or bigger. I have a larger structure than most and require more sets/reps than other people, your needs might vary. It is a Pull , Push, Legs program that has a strength block and hypertrophy block. My goal was to get bigger and also stronger. Times where I wouldn't get stronger, I would change the rep ranges for the Squat, Bench and Deadlift such as doing sets of 8 or 10 at the same intensity. It is also important to back off the weight and de load every once in a while when you plateau.

I train 6 times a week, either doing PPL/Rest/PPL or PPL/PPL/Rest. I'm always ready to go resting 2 days per body part.

Here is what I did :

Day 1: Back and Biceps

1x5 Deadlifts @ RPE 9, warm up to your 5-rep max and perform the sets and reps listed. Then lower the weight to an RPE of 8 and do it for 5 reps.

3x8-12 Lat pull downs, you can use different hand grip variations and do 2 drop sets/set of 10-12.

3x8-12 Seated cable rows, you can use different hand grip variations and do 2 drop sets/set of 10-12.

3x10-12 Pull ups, either assisted, bodyweight or added weight.

3x10-12 Cable pull overs, use the rope.

2x10-12 Bicep curls, with 2 drop sets/set until failure, you can use any variation.

2x10-12 Hammer bicep curls, with 2 drop sets/set until failure.

Tips :

Be consistent, that is the number one rule you should follow. Don't eat good day 1 and then start eating junk by day 3.

Train with proper form and enough volume.

Sleep well.

IT TAKES TIME AND EFFORT, you're not going to magically gain a bunch of muscle overnight and lose fat.

The more you dedicate to it, the more the results.

Stretching has helped so much with my performance, spend around 10-15 minutes of this before every workout.

Do not compare yourself to other, your progress is individualistic. My buddy who I started lifting with could cry himself every day because he doesn't have as much muscle as I do, but instead he focuses on becoming the best he can be.

I plan to cut down to 220lbs in the next 2 months and begin slowly introducing calories and getting bigger. I also look to compete in both bodybuilding and power lifting this year.

&lt;p&gt;Before and after photos : &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/JRm2pXN""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/JRm2pXN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stomach is tucked in my underwear in the image above, here&amp;#39;s an image with it not tucked so everyone can see : &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/XHTAG0C""&gt;https://imgur.com/XHTAG0C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note* : I have had gastric bypass done at the age of 15 that helped me get down to 250lbs, seeing how I had stopped losing weight and did not like my physique, I began eating properly and hitting the gym. I also had my gyno and some loose skin removed from my chest in February 2019. Had gyno ever since I was 13. No steroids were used in the making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diet :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my stomach had expanded to a point where I could eat like how I used to, I had one goal in mind, to get as jacked as possible. Started to use a calorie calculator, and tracked what I ate. I had a healthy diet which is high in protein, carbs and low in fats accompanied with veggies. Whichever calculator you use, it will give you a close estimate to how much you need to eat in order to gain or lose weight, the rest is trial and error until you figure out what works for you. Everyone&amp;#39;s metabolism is different. All meals included either chicken,beef,fish and eggs accompanied with rice,pasta,bread or any other carb source I had. Also a lot of low sugar ketchup because It makes it go down easy. You can do it however you like, I am more comfortable restricting myself rather than doing IIFYM (if it fits your macros) or any other diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workouts :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people don&amp;#39;t do enough sets and reps. You need to take the muscle to a point of failure to cause it to grow. If the goal was to do 12 reps for that set, you shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do 13-14 reps (with proper form). That means the muscle has failed and you cannot perform the movement. I include drop sets and half reps when I hit that point. I drop the weight by 20-25% for dropsets. Lets say you do 100lbs for the lat pull down, once you finish your first set, you drop down to 80lbs and do reps till failure. Below Is the exact workout routine I have had since becoming knowledgeable on effective training, I have not stopped getting stronger or bigger. I have a larger structure than most and require more sets/reps than other people, your needs might vary. It is a Pull , Push, Legs program that has a strength block and hypertrophy block. My goal was to get bigger and also stronger. Times where I wouldn&amp;#39;t get stronger, I would change the rep ranges for the Squat, Bench and Deadlift such as doing sets of 8 or 10 at the same intensity. It is also important to back off the weight and de load every once in a while when you plateau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I train 6 times a week, either doing PPL/Rest/PPL or PPL/PPL/Rest. I&amp;#39;m always ready to go resting 2 days per body part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I did :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1: Back and Biceps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1x5 Deadlifts @ RPE 9, warm up to your 5-rep max and perform the sets and reps listed. Then lower the weight to an RPE of 8 and do it for 5 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 Lat pull downs, you can use different hand grip variations and do 2 drop sets/set of 10-12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 Seated cable rows, you can use different hand grip variations and do 2 drop sets/set of 10-12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x10-12 Pull ups, either assisted, bodyweight or added weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x10-12 Cable pull overs, use the rope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2x10-12 Bicep curls, with 2 drop sets/set until failure, you can use any variation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2x10-12 Hammer bicep curls, with 2 drop sets/set until failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2: Chest, Shoulders and Triceps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5x5 Bench Press @ RPE 9, warm up to your 5-rep max and perform the sets and reps listed. Then lower the weight to an RPE of 8 and do it for 5 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x10-12 Pec fly’s, with 2 drop sets/set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x10-12 Front delt raises, with 2 drop sets/set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10-12 Tricep pushdowns, with 2 drop sets/set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 3: Leg Day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5x5 Squats @ RPE 9, warm up to your 5-rep max and perform the sets and reps listed.Then lower the weight to an RPE of 8 and do it for 5 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-10 Romanian dead-lifts, dumbbell or barbell.&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"*Disclaimer:* I originally wrote/posted this for /r/weightroom, so considering the slightly different average user base here I wanted to add something. Most every program in the wiki/commonly discussed here is a good choice for almost anyone familiar with the basic barbell movements. This program is not a good choice for a beginner or 'early intermediate'. Layne has a blanket suggestion of having at least a 350 wilks score on squat/bench/dead before starting the program. While the specific strength you have isn't necessarily relevant, you absolutely must have a substantial base in terms of work capacity and technical proficiency in the lifts, particularly consistency under fatigue. You WILL do a lot of hard sets back to back to back to back and keep doing so for the entirety of the 12 weeks. As written, burnout and some minor injuries while running this program aren't that unlikely, and that risk is only going to be magnified if you lack sufficient skill and conditioning. So with that out of the way: 

Before going into this [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ckQfaMim4G-it8JZyb3D1MQqfP34ydzCR9K1th-QMwg/edit#gid=1003723868) is the spreadsheet I used. I think there is more information available but I went in with nothing but this sheet and the knowledge the its supposed to be run with a real 1RM, not a TM.

Results:

I don't believe that strength is a set thing that can be easily measured, so I never really like to say ""I got stronger"", particularly only after 12 weeks. How much you lift on any given day is influenced by so much more than how 'strong' you are. That said, I did set multiple PRs while running the program, and regularly tied old best sets.

Biggest PRs:

615x10 Deadlift (~40lb PR on best e1RM, ~60lbs on best actual 1RM)

405x12 Squat (~40lb PR on best e1RM and actual 1RM).

Some PR for bench that I don't remember, wasnt as significant (~10-15lb e1RM over best 1RM)

No other lift is really focused on in the program.

I can't say how much of this progress was actually strength gained from the program and how much was expression of strength due to a lot of practice at SBD with heavy loads from this program, and slightly reduced work load (for the first half of the program).

Size wise I won't really speculate. I am at a point were I don't think any program would make much of a change in onlt 12 weeks. I am happy with a small improvement over the course of a year.

Training History/Stats:

I'll be brief. I've been training ~6 years. Currently 6'5''/265 at tail end of bulk, probably 260ish at start of program. PRs going in being 520/365/765 SBD. I used slightly reduced 1RMs to plug into the program as I don't know if I would have been able to actually hit those numbers right at the start, having just come off Deep Water inspired training which definitely had me primed for higher rep lower weight instead of the opposite.

Program Description and General Thoughts:

PH3 is a 5 day/week program heavily focused on SBD. You will squat 3x a week, bench 3x a week and Deadlift 2x a week. There is a SBD day, a pure upper hypertrophy day, A SB day, a BD day and a S day. Two of those days also prescribe lower body hypertrophy work and another one prescribes upper body hypertrophy. You will do a lot of sets of each with moderate to, frankly, insane weights. If you run it exactly as written you will probably burn out or get injured (or maybe I am just a little bitch). BUT, I had a lot of fun with it, thought it was very beneficial and will run it again at some point with modifications. Ill go into what I think about how to modify it after this. I really enjoyed SBDing that much and using higher weights than I usually do. Up until the end there were a lot of days I thought there was no way I could do that but ended up finishing without too much trouble.

The program is split into 3 1 month phases, Ill briefly go over each and my thoughts.

Phase 1; Accumulation:

This phase is fine as written. It isn't too bad, and eases you into the high frequency heavy work in a reasonable manner. I have been doing 6x a week for years now so getting that extra rest day was weird at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly. I was pretty burned out at my 6x week Deep Water experiment (you probably should not do that) so it ended up being welcome. I bought a concept2 rower to use on off days. Each week follows the same layout, minus the 4th which sets you up for some test sets. Each subsequent week will make each workout a bit harder, adding a set, or weight to the sets. Weeks 2/3 have an AMRAP set for each lift. I think you can feel free to push these in this phase, but you might want to misrepresent them in the spreadsheet (see the modifications section).

Phase 2; Transition:

This phase is pretty much the same as the first, only harder. I would say that is stage is, as written, doable but challenging in of itself, but might need some toning down if you want to be able to take on the third phase close to as written. I think there were a couple days I cut a few squat sets, and one day I cut some bench sets. I started getting some lingering issues in my knee during this phase but nothing really unmanageable. I completely skipped one SB day because I went out the night before and it was probably for the best that I did so. I had some PRs in this phase still.

Phase 3; Intensity/Overreaching phase Go fuck yourself:

Here is where it kind of fell apart, at least for me. I am willing to acknowledge that maybe I was just not up to snuff for this program, and that it was a personal failing, not a failing on the programs side, but I don't really think so (that or I missed some nuances in the background material). It, like the last two programs, keeps the theme of ramping up sets, weight and the odd rep number, over 4 weeks. Unlike the previous 2, it starts at a challenging level, and ramps into insane levels. I powered through the first 2, easiest weeks, not cutting much, still dealing with my knee which was manageable with warm up and conscientious squat technique. Beginning of week three I did something to my shoulder that lead to it being numb and painful at shoulder/elbow when squatting or benching. This was also week of Christmas so I cut 1 or 2 days and for the rest just tried to hit the same body parts to whatever degree I could, just stopping when my arm acted up too much. Week 4, instead of tapering down for PR sets like in the first two phases, keeps ramping up and culminates with the instructions to do a day in which you Deadlift 5x2 + AMRAP set with 95.5% and Bench 5x3 + AMRAP at 95.5% one day, then Squat 5x3 + AMRAP at 95.5% the second. This are percentages of numbers that have crept very close to my true 1RMS. And done after 11 weeks of punishing training. I completely gave up on even attempting it as written and split each exercise into seperate days, and toned it down a bit. Deads were reduced by 25lbs but completed as written, bench was reduced to 2 reps with the prescribed weight and barely completed, with no additional reps on the AMRAP. Ill have to see how squats feel on Friday to decide how I will handle it. Basically TL;DR of this phase is it's bullshit. Maybe it would have been less bullshit if I didnt tweakmy shoulder.

Modifications:

As I said a few times earlier, I think you need to de-fang this program a little bit going into it. Or just man the fuck up more than I did. Here are a couple options I have considered after going through it.

Lower you 1RM: One obvious option is to lower the number you enter into the sheet to lower the intensity of the entire program. This is probably my least favorite suggestion. Maybe it is due to my history of 531 and 531 inspired training but NOT using really sub-maximal weight for most of your sets is a refreshing part of this program, and a GOOD part of the challenge. I think you can go in with a REALISTIC 1RM (not what you did that one time on a good day when the stars aligned and Buddha was spotting your spirit, what you could reasonably hope to put up for a single most days if you tried really hard). A sub-suggestion and better idea is to slightly under-represent your AMRAPs, or just hold them back when you do them (but where is the fun in that).

Cutting sets: A better option I think is to cut down on the sets prescribed. As mentioned above, phase one is probably fine. Phase 2 doesn't need much. But phase 3 could definitely do with some pruning. I think the best way to do this would be to not ramp up the sets on the non-AMRAP days. So day 1 (SBD) and day 3 (SB), keep the workout as listed for the first week. Maybe limit phase 2 at the second weeks workouts.

Just Trust Yourself: If you have the training experience and confidence to actually determine how your body is doing (and you should have at least a lot of experience before doing this program, even if some people never really like to trust there subjective observations) you can just take each day as a suggestion/challenge, and cut yourself off when appropriate. The issue with this is there will probably be some days where you can push through to the end, but you will be shooting yourself in the foot for future days. But if you have an idea of what fatigue feels like and can estimate where you will be next week depending on how you feel this week, it could work well.

Closing Thoughts:

I like this program. I think its bullshit at the end. It injured me a bit (not the first program to do that though). It has mostly wiped me out. But I like it and would recommend it. It does need to be pared down a little, but has a lot of potential.

Also before I get asked in the comments, I just did some stuff for the hypertrophy work. It doesn't matter, it's fucking accessory work. Just do some sets of things you like until you get tired. Don't neglect your back work. Same advice as you can give about picking the accessories for anything. The barbell work is the main dish, stop worrying about the side salad (which is probably made with shitty iceberg lettuce anyways).

EDIT:
Well as I said I might, I ended up making some changes to PH3:

[PHw33ni3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tCi26oYp8GvT7bJuoTGDvbqy8mazemFxD02Nl4xaFRQ/edit?usp=sharing)

I tried to keep it as close and true to the original as I could, just shaved down to what I think is reasonably completable. I left several areas open to user discretion so one can push themselves if they are on a roll, but I want to emphasize that for most of those options its not a matter of saying ""Yeah, really push for all those sets"" it's just leaving the option if you truly found the base number easy, think Joker sets. I ended up preserving the last week as best I could. I think it SHOULD be a challange and it's not like there is anything after it you gotta save energy for. I did file down it's teeth a little bit though. 

I included a changelog that I think has every change I made so you can see what is different.

Most every program in the wiki/commonly discussed here is a good choice for almost anyone familiar with the basic barbell movements. This program is not a good choice for a beginner or &amp;#39;early intermediate&amp;#39;. Layne has a blanket suggestion of having at least a 350 wilks score on squat/bench/dead before starting the program. While the specific strength you have isn&amp;#39;t necessarily relevant, you absolutely must have a substantial base in terms of work capacity and technical proficiency in the lifts, particularly consistency under fatigue. You WILL do a lot of hard sets back to back to back to back and keep doing so for the entirety of the 12 weeks. As written, burnout and some minor injuries while running this program aren&amp;#39;t that unlikely, and that risk is only going to be magnified if you lack sufficient skill and conditioning. So with that out of the way: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going into this &lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ckQfaMim4G-it8JZyb3D1MQqfP34ydzCR9K1th-QMwg/edit#gid=1003723868""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the spreadsheet I used. I think there is more information available but I went in with nothing but this sheet and the knowledge the its supposed to be run with a real 1RM, not a TM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe that strength is a set thing that can be easily measured, so I never really like to say &amp;quot;I got stronger&amp;quot;, particularly only after 12 weeks. How much you lift on any given day is influenced by so much more than how &amp;#39;strong&amp;#39; you are. That said, I did set multiple PRs while running the program, and regularly tied old best sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biggest PRs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;615x10 Deadlift (~40lb PR on best e1RM, ~60lbs on best actual 1RM)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;405x12 Squat (~40lb PR on best e1RM and actual 1RM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some PR for bench that I don&amp;#39;t remember, wasnt as significant (~10-15lb e1RM over best 1RM)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No other lift is really focused on in the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t say how much of this progress was actually strength gained from the program and how much was expression of strength due to a lot of practice at SBD with heavy loads from this program, and slightly reduced work load (for the first half of the program).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Size wise I won&amp;#39;t really speculate. I am at a point were I don&amp;#39;t think any program would make much of a change in onlt 12 weeks. I am happy with a small improvement over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training History/Stats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be brief. I&amp;#39;ve been training ~6 years. Currently 6&amp;#39;5&amp;#39;&amp;#39;/265 at tail end of bulk, probably 260ish at start of program. PRs going in being 520/365/765 SBD. I used slightly reduced 1RMs to plug into the program as I don&amp;#39;t know if I would have been able to actually hit those numbers right at the start, having just come off Deep Water inspired training which definitely had me primed for higher rep lower weight instead of the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Program Description and General Thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PH3 is a 5 day/week program heavily focused on SBD. You will squat 3x a week, bench 3x a week and Deadlift 2x a week. There is a SBD day, a pure upper hypertrophy day, A SB day, a BD day and a S day. Two of those days also prescribe lower body hypertrophy work and another one prescribes upper body hypertrophy. You will do a lot of sets of each with moderate to, frankly, insane weights. If you run it exactly as written you will probably burn out or get injured (or maybe I am just a little bitch). BUT, I had a lot of fun with it, thought it was very beneficial and will run it again at some point with modifications. Ill go into what I think about how to modify it after this. I really enjoyed SBDing that much and using higher weights than I usually do. Up until the end there were a lot of days I thought there was no way I could do that but ended up finishing without too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program is split into 3 1 month phases, Ill briefly go over each and my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1; Accumulation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phase is fine as written. It isn&amp;#39;t too bad, and eases you into the high frequency heavy work in a reasonable manner.

,Fitness,"Hey everyone,

Had kind of a weird experience today. I've been going to the gym pretty regularly for the past 6 months to get myself back into shape and one exercise that I always kind of avoided was deadlifting. Back when I played football in high school, I hurt my lower back due to bad form on my deadlifts and I've kind of avoided it ever since. But it turned to the point that my deadlift max was lower than my squat max. So since November or so I've began working on my deadlift, especially heavy deadlifts, and finally started getting a feel for the proper form and now deadlift more than my squat like most people do.

But as you know, heavy deadlifts can be loud by nature when returning to the floor from the top. I always come down with the bar and I never just drop it (I lower the bar similarly to this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o4N4935tMk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o4N4935tMk) ). However, as I have been increasing weight, it's natural for the sound to be a bit loud when hitting the floor. I've never had issues though except today. Granted the gym was empty today except for one other person and the employee at the desk overseeing the gym. But this person got off their exercise bike and walked all the way over to the gym desk to complain about what I was doing. The employee came by and told me to stop dropping the weights. I wasn't, but I just nodded my head since I didn't want to start a fuss or anything. It's the first time I've ever had a gym employee come by to tell me something so I was also caught off-guard. I've never had an issue before when I dead-lifted the same way and the employee didn't seem to mind at all until the other woman came by to complain. I then basically lifted the same way, but tried to kind of baby the weight down more instead of lowering it like the video. But this caused twinges in my lower back. I ended up just stopping deadlifts for the day since I didn't want more complaints directed at me or to get kicked out.

So my question to fellow fitness goers is how do you guys lower the bar for heavy deadlifts quietly, but prevent back injury? Should I just cut the weight down so I can fully control it down?

Or should I treat this like a one off event and keep doing what I usually do?

Thanks! :)

Note: This is also a university gym if it matters and unfortunately, I don't have the funds to pay for a gym membership at a different gym.

UPDATE: Holy crap this blew up while I was asleep.  The gym does not have a deadlift platform or bumper plates unfortunately.

UPDATE 2: I really appreciate the advice and replies throughout. It was cool to see that a lot of people are okay with some noise and go to gyms where it isn't an issue. I hope to find a gym like this in the future. It was funny to read even if some of them seemed certain to get me kicked out. Also nice to see suggestions like the eccentrics, mats, etc. I will definitely try those out and see what works best for me. I also may send an email to the Rec people at the university to see if bumper plates and/or a platform might be things they could look at getting. Honestly, I got a little discouraged about deadlifting because of what happened with the lady complaining and my back injury in high school. Bad things always seem to happen when I start deadlifting. But it's nice to see the encouragement. Thanks r/fitness.

,Fitness,"Hi All,   


I wonder if anybody would weigh on this. I am reading the book ""You Are Your Own Gym"" about calisthenics and fellow writes the following:  
""The reason many people gain weight as they age, especially beginning in their 30s, is because they have less muscle than they had in their late teens and early twenties. As we age, our bodies naturally lose muscle, especially as we are less active in our lives. This muscle tissue loss results in a decreasing metabolic rate. And then, if you continue to eat like you did when you were younger… well, you’ll slowly gain weight, pound by pound, month by month, year by year, until one day you look in the mirror and wonder, “What happened?” The key to eliminating accumulated body fat is regaining your youthful metabolism by regaining your muscle.

Muscle is the most metabolically expensive tissue we have: It takes between 50 and 100 calories a day just to keep one pound of muscle alive, for both men and women, even if you are completely inactive. An extra five pounds of muscle can burn up to 15,000 calories in a month—that’s the equivalent of two pounds of fat. Muscle is the single greatest tool for weight loss. Increased muscle mass let’s you lose weight with less attention paid to calorie  
counting and food selection.

But with consistent aerobic exercise, over time, you’re far more likely to burn five pounds of muscle. That means your body will burn at least 250 less calories a day. And as your body becomes more efficient at running, that 195 calories you burn on the treadmill will decrease to about 125. So let’s do the math: You burn 125 calories above your resting metabolic rate each day you do aerobic exercise. Then add the minimum 250 calories you do not burn due to muscle loss caused by this exercise. After all your huffing and puffing you are now 125 calories in the wrong direction!""

[Body](https://imgur.com/a/Wp4GNc0)

[Face](https://imgur.com/a/101fuH6)

**Weight:**

~350 lbs -&gt; 227.4lbs

**Diet:**

Diet was pretty much just portion control. Eating a lot of the things I still liked at first but at a lower amount than before. I tried my hardest to keep around 1500 calories a day. Pretty much what I did was I found a TDEE calculator, and cut my basal metabolic rate in half and ate that much. My diet was pretty much exclusively Chicken breast, microwave mixed vegetables, peanut butter sandwiches, apples, and protein shakes. 
I am still pretty bad when it comes to eating healthy, making it a bit harder to lose the last 15-20 lbs I want to lose, but I'm getting better at it every day.

**Lifting Program:**

In the beginning I stuck to the pretty simple Push, Pull, Legs program. Tried to do my best by doing 5x5 on compound lifts, and just 4x10 on everything else. After a while I started to modify my lifting program, and started doing Chest/Triceps, Back/Biceps, Chest/Shoulders, Legs. I also moved to higher volume, lower weight on back and bicep day (especially biceps), and vice versa on Chest day. Here is my current Program

**Chest/Tricep:**

5x5: 

Bench

Incline Bench

4x8:

Incline Dumbbell Bench

Chest Press

Fly Machine 

Tricep Pushdown
 
Tricep Pulldown
 
Skull Crushers 

Squeeze Press

One Arm Tricep Pulldowns

**Back/Bicep:**

4x10: 

Bent Over Rows

Barbell Shrugs

3x15:

Dumbbell Hammer Curl

Preacher Curl

Barbell Curl

Incline Dumbbell Curls

Dumbbell Row

Cable Pulldown

Cable Row

Assisted Pull up

**Chest/Shoulders:**

5x5: 

Bench

OHP (usually try and pyramid up to a max for OHP, helps with my shoulder development)

4x10:

Incline Dumbbell Bench

Chest Press

Fly Machine 

Lateral Raises

Arnold Press

Reverse Dumbbell Fly

Reverse Fly Machine

Face Pull

Lateral Cable Raises 

**Leg:**

5x5:

Squat 

Deadlift (Conventional or Sumo, depends on how im feeling)

4x10:

Hamstring curls

Leg Extension (low weight usually)

Abduction Machine

Adduction Machine

Leg Press

Calf Raises

**Core:**

Usually throw in 2 quick core exercises at the end of each day

**Cardio:**

I Bike everywhere at school (in College currently), but I also occasionally do Boxing, Jumprope, and Running. 

**Lift Progression:**

Bench: 115 -&gt; 195 (1 Rep Max)

Overhead Press: 65 -&gt; 115 (1 Rep Max)

Deadlift: 225 -&gt; 335 (1 Rep Max)

Squat: 135 -&gt; 225 (5x5)

**How I got Fat:** 

My family has always been fairly unhealthy. While I was encouraged to do sports when I was younger, it fell off pretty hard when I got into middle/highschool. From 7th to 8th grade I gained around 60 lbs, and when I was a freshman in highschool I weighed 300lbs. I ended up doing some weightlifting in Highschool for a Physical Education credit, but ended up stopping half way through. I spent most of my days just playing video games, and eating all I wanted. This eventually lead to me weighing about 350 lbs during my Highschool Graduation. My Graduation Gown was so tight on me I couldn’t even sit down with it zipped up. When I got to college, my eating habits continued. While I was more active walking around campus, I had an all you can eat meal plan, and boy did I use it. Between eating large pizzas at least 3 times a week, eating full tubs of Ben and Jerry's ice cream daily, and nightly Subway runs, I maintained my weight of 350 lbs throughout my first year of college. 

**How I got Fit:**

While I had done some moderate lifting earlier on in 2019, it wasn't until after my 20th Birthday, that I decided to go all in. I was sick of being fat, and I finally accepted how much I hated my body. In early April I decided to start my diet and exercise routine and finally take it seriously. With the semester ended, I had a ridiculous amount of time to exercise, and I took advantage of my Universities gyms. Just trying to wake up every day and go was a bit of a hassle at first, but I stuck with it. Slowly I began to see a difference on the scale, where I would drop around 10 lbs a week for my first month. While this amount of weight loss does sound massively unhealthy, I think it was mostly a product of the amount I was eating before. Before dieting I was most likely eating upwards of 5000 Calories a day, and cutting it down to 1500 was hard, but made me drop weight like crazy. By the end of the summer, after about 4 months of Dieting and Exercise, I was finally down to about 260lbs. As school started up again, I ended up seeing most of my friends who freaked out when seeing the fact that I dropped 80-90lbs over summer. After that I continued my diet/exercise, and eventually dropped down to where I am at now, 227.4 lbs. While during the Fall semester I did cheat on my meals a lot, drank a good amount, and overall didn't stick to my diet, I was really happy I remained active and didn’t bounce back with my weight.
 
**Future goals:**

My Goal Weight is 205, and I want to hit that preferably in the first quarter of 2020. A big one is also benching 225 for the first time, which hopefully will happen very soon. As for this year, I hope to be able to increase all my compound lifts by 100 lbs (I know its a lofty goal, but aim high hit low) by the end of 2020.

**Improvements Outside of the Gym:**

As for outside of the gym, my life has changed pretty drastically. All the posts on reddit saying that people treat you differently when you are a more natural weight is true. People treat me better, and it has made me so much more comfortable in my own skin. I feel like i'm much more outgoing now, and it has improved my happiness quite a bit. I even ended up dating the girl i've had a huge crush on for the past year and a half, which is pretty crazy in its own right. 

It's never too late to start losing weight. I thought I was fucked because of how heavy I was, and that I’d never be able to commit. I finally did, and it was the greatest decision of my life. If you are viewing this on New Years for encouragement, please go through with it. It will be the best thing you’ve ever done for yourself.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I got Fat:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family has always been fairly unhealthy. While I was encouraged to do sports when I was younger, it fell off pretty hard when I got into middle/highschool. From 7th to 8th grade I gained around 60 lbs, and when I was a freshman in highschool I weighed 300lbs. I ended up doing some weightlifting in Highschool for a Physical Education credit, but ended up stopping half way through. I spent most of my days just playing video games, and eating all I wanted. This eventually lead to me weighing about 350 lbs during my Highschool Graduation. My Graduation Gown was so tight on me I couldn’t even sit down with it zipped up. When I got to college, my eating habits continued. While I was more active walking around campus, I had an all you can eat meal plan, and boy did I use it. Between eating large pizzas at least 3 times a week, eating full tubs of Ben and Jerry&amp;#39;s ice cream daily, and nightly Subway runs, I maintained my weight of 350 lbs throughout my first year of college. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I got Fit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I had done some moderate lifting earlier on in 2019, it wasn&amp;#39;t until after my 20th Birthday, that I decided to go all in. I was sick of being fat, and I finally accepted how much I hated my body. In early April I decided to start my diet and exercise routine and finally take it seriously. With the semester ended, I had a ridiculous amount of time to exercise, and I took advantage of my Universities gyms. Just trying to wake up every day and go was a bit of a hassle at first, but I stuck with it. Slowly I began to see a difference on the scale, where I would drop around 10 lbs a week for my first month. While this amount of weight loss does sound massively unhealthy, I think it was mostly a product of the amount I was eating before. Before dieting I was most likely eating upwards of 5000 Calories a day, and cutting it down to 1500 was hard, but made me drop weight like crazy. By the end of the summer, after about 4 months of Dieting and Exercise, I was finally down to about 260lbs. As school started up again, I ended up seeing most of my friends who freaked out when seeing the fact that I dropped 80-90lbs over summer. After that I continued my diet/exercise, and eventually dropped down to where I am at now, 227.4 lbs. While during the Fall semester I did cheat on my meals a lot, drank a good amount, and overall didn&amp;#39;t stick to my diet, I was really happy I remained active and didn’t bounce back with my weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future goals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Goal Weight is 205, and I want to hit that preferably in the first quarter of 2020. A big one is also benching 225 for the first time, which hopefully will happen very soon. As for this year, I hope to be able to increase all my compound lifts by 100 lbs (I know its a lofty goal, but aim high hit low) by the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvements Outside of the Gym:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for outside of the gym, my life has changed pretty drastically. All the posts on reddit saying that people treat you differently when you are a more natural weight is true. People treat me better, and it has made me so much more comfortable in my own skin. I feel like i&amp;#39;m much more outgoing now, and it has improved my happiness quite a bit. I even ended up dating the girl i&amp;#39;ve had a huge crush on for the past year and a half, which is pretty crazy in its own right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never too late to start losing weight. I thought I was fucked because of how heavy I was, and that I’d never be able to commit. I finally did, and it was the greatest decision of my life. If you are viewing this on New Years for encouragement, please go through with it. It will be the best thing you’ve ever done for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy New Years!&lt;/p&gt;

Happy NYE!  I read an article a few months ago ([https://www.t-nation.com/training/4-dumbest-ab-exercises](https://www.t-nation.com/training/4-dumbest-ab-exercises)) discussing ab exercises.  The author talks about ones he feels are bad, and what he feels are better alternatives.  If you scroll about halfway down, he discusses weighted decline crunches (always my favorite), why he thinks they are ineffective/unhealthy, and his suggestion as an alternative, the ""90 degree plate press"".

I did 5/3/1 BBB for some time and got great results, but I need some change in my routine and the idea of splitting up the volume of each compound into two separate days appeals to me.

I'm currently at 168.2 kg (\~371 pounds) down from 241.5kg (532 pounds) and have no started going to the gym to improve and speed up my weight loss, and just be more healthy in general. I have a few general questions though:

1) I've been aiming for doing \~ 7 - 12 reps and 3 sets for each weight lifting exercise. The problem is, the reps can drop a lot with each set. Eg: I can do 12 reps of chest flyes for the first two sets, but only 8 for the last one. For the last set, should I just continue with a lower weight, or accept the 8 for the last set? This has been a bigger concern when the reps start to fall out of the 7 - 12 range, say for example I start off doing 7 reps, but then only do 5 after. What's the protocol here?

2) Should I bother with reps that I can't complete? Like for example, when doing bicep curls, sometimes I can get an extra one or two on my left arm if I kind of swing my back a little to get some momentum. Should I do this to complete my reps for each set if needed, or is it useless?

3) I'm currently losing weight from 1 - 2 kg a week. I've heard at this rate, it's hard to build muscle as I'd be losing so much of it. If there is truth to that, what can be done for it?

,Fitness,"Hey there everyone.

 I'm currently dealing with an issue with my adductors where they are always sore and feel tight. My main sport is running (not elite, but definitely above average), and I do relatively high mileage (around 100+km per week), with 2 strength sessions per week.

What happens is that during a run usually around the 30min mark, my adductors will start to feel really tight and after running, they will be extremely sore to the point where if I try to close my legs together it will be very painful. Stretching and foam rolling only offers temporary relief. I also feel a lot of soreness when I wake up, to the point where I have no motivation to do anything. I've tried just resting for 2 full weeks (just doing the strength work), but it didn't improve at all.

One theory that I have, is that maybe my adductors are really weak and they get tight so they don't get injured (?).  I've started some adductor specific exercises at home, but since it's been only a few days I don't have any progress so far, and I was wondering if someone here could confirm my theory or offer some advice.

Also, this is a recurring issue. I've had this problem at least 2 other times, to the point where I had to go to PT. But the only thing they addressed was the pain and give me glute exercises, which are already part of my routine and haven't done anything to solve the issue. 

Thanks in advance",t2_xf5hh,False,,0,False,My adductors are always sore,[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_ehjhap,False,dark,,public,8,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1577723480.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently dealing with an issue with my adductors where they are always sore and feel tight. My main sport is running (not elite, but definitely above average), and I do relatively high mileage (around 100+km per week), with 2 strength sessions per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens is that during a run usually around the 30min mark, my adductors will start to feel really tight and after running, they will be extremely sore to the point where if I try to close my legs together it will be very painful. Stretching and foam rolling only offers temporary relief. I also feel a lot of soreness when I wake up, to the point where I have no motivation to do anything. I&amp;#39;ve tried just resting for 2 full weeks (just doing the strength work), but it didn&amp;#39;t improve at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One theory that I have, is that maybe my adductors are really weak and they get tight so they don&amp;#39;t get injured (?).  I&amp;#39;ve started some adductor specific exercises at home, but since it&amp;#39;s been only a few days I don&amp;#39;t have any progress so far, and I was wondering if someone here could confirm my theory or offer some advice.&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"Hello! 6'2, \~205 lb male here. Been athletic my whole life with some experience lifting but wanted to make a more serious commitment to getting stronger.

Starting this past summer, I did a couple of months of full-body workouts (which were a bit aimless) and then did 3 months of 5/3/1 for beginners, putting on \~25 lb over the last 4 months (tracking with MyFitnessPal, meant to gain 1 lb/week). Current lifts are squat 10x245, bench 9x185, deadlift 11x270, OHP 7x85 (estimated 1RM 327, 240, 369, 105 respectively).

I know it hasn't been long, but I've had some thoughts:

1. I haven't really liked the 5/3/1 Beginner assistance templates, but like the idea of a super simple hypertrophy/volume program like Boring But Big.
2. I haven't been super accurate with tracking but I want to try to eat for recomposition/maintenance, as I've gotten a bit more of a tummy than I'd like lol. \[Probably a combination of underestimating my intake and overshooting on fats.\] I was planning on getting up to 210 and then cutting, though.
3. I want to make a bit more progress on OHP (and chin/pull-ups), so I plan to have the ""assistance work after the assistance work (BBB sets)"" consist of a couple of these after the 5/3/1 and 5x10 sets:
   1. Dips (I can do 10x10, so should I do like 3x10 weighted?),
   2. Face pulls/shoulder raises (3x10?),
   3. Chin/pull-ups (5xAMRAP?),
   4. Rows (3x8-10?), and
   5. Some ab work (like 3x15 leg raises or something?)

Is it reasonable to switch to 5/3/1 BBB at this point? (I read a couple of posts that it's outdated...?) Are my ideas for assistance work okay? Or should I just stick with 5/3/1 for beginners, or do normal 5/3/1 with some assistance work...

The main things I'm worried about are that (1) I might have problems with time management as I'm going from 3 workouts/week to 4, and I have a particularly rough year coming up in grad school, and (2) that I won't be able to progress without a caloric surplus (especially on BBB).

Is this giving my body enough time to rest and build muscle? Is this likely to have a notable improvement on my strength training if I do the last 6 weeks twice a week instead of 3 times a week? Don't want to put in twice the time if there would only be a very minor impact.

Another approach would be to complete the same running workouts (same mileage, same effort in the correct heart rate zones, same types of workouts wether intervals, tempos, aerobic efforts) while lifting, while accepting the slower pace performance.

The two theories here are heart rate based training versus actual training performance.

**BACKSTORY**

About 4 months ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/crve01/5_months_without_lifting_about_to_get_back_into/) in this subreddit asking for some advice on how to best get back into a lifting routine without being completely destroyed by debilitating soreness the next day. Suffice it to say, the advice was incredibly helpful &amp; I wasn't TOO sore after my first few days back (at least not as bad as I expected). So, many thanks to this community, you guys are super knowledgeable!

Well, much to my surprise, since that post I've actually been able to make going to the gym a habit. After many years of stopping &amp; going, while never being able to consistently make it a habit, I've finally done it boys. This may not seem like a big deal, but if you knew the true extent of my inherent laziness &amp; overall inclination for procrastination, you would understand. Since the first day I started (8-19-19), I've gone 6 days a week and have yet to miss a day. I'm wrapping up week 19 now. Honestly, I feel freaking great. I'm a bit bummed I didn't do this sooner. But oh well, I'm happy with the results thus far, and while I still have a long way to go, I'm more motivated than ever.

For me, the secret that enabled me to finally make it habitual ended up being quite simple actually. Before, whenever I'd try to get into a long term workout routine, I was never able to stick with it primarily because after work I'd want to do nothing more than come home &amp; lay around (the laziness I was talking about). It was very hard to force myself to go to the gym. Well, this time around I decided to go to the gym BEFORE work. Here's the thing though. I work 6 days a week starting at 8:00 AM. This is NOT going to be easy. Or so I thought. Turns out, it was ALOT easier. For one, I basically gave myself a rule that if I go into work that day, I MUST go to the gym before hand. It's a mandatory prerequisite. No gym, no work, and vice versa. I fail to go to the gym, I don't work that day which gets me in trouble at work (funny how when you create additional consequences for yourself, motivation seems to MAGICALLY appear). Plus, it solves two problems. One, I get my workout done for the day &amp; still get to go home after work and be as lazy as my heart desires. Two, I no longer need to drink energy drinks to start my day because I feel very mentally focused &amp; full of energy after a workout (much more so than an energy drink would give me). Being that I work in sales, mental clarity is a necessity, and working out before work ensures I will have this mental clarity 100% of the time. So for anybody struggling to stick to a schedule, I highly recommend going before work. The hardest part about it was simply getting started. After day 1, honestly, sticking with it was cake.

&amp;#x200B;

**ROUTINE**

I've been doing the [PHUL routine](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout) for the entire run so far. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday are the lifting days. I do cardio (30 mins on elliptical) and abs on Wednesdays and Sundays. I do about 10 minutes of stretching &amp; 10 minutes on the elliptical before every workout.

Here's the progression of each main lift thus far (I'm using the app called ""Zero to Hero"" for tracking):

* [Bench Press](https://imgur.com/a/BxIZ7AX)
* [Squat](https://imgur.com/a/0sW7F4C)
* [Deadlift](https://imgur.com/a/dVhHNVv)

For lift progression, I'll only move up in weight by 5 lbs once I'm able to hit the max reps &amp; sets for that lift. For example, I'll try incline DB bench press for 4 sets of 12 with 65 lb dumbbells. If I only do 3 sets of 12 and 1 set of 11, I'll try that same weight again the next week. I'll do this until I hit 4x12, then the following week I'll move up to 70 lb dumbbells. Etc. However I don't do this with EVERY lift though. Things like barbell curls, lateral raises, etc. I'll often stick with the same reps and sets at a certain weight for many weeks before deciding to move up in weight.

&amp;#x200B;

**DIET**

As far as diet, admittedly I'm not following a hardcore diet routine. I'm just being more aware of what I'm eating &amp; trying to limit the bad stuff. For breakfast, I eat 2 packets of oatmeal (maple and brown sugar MMMM) and mix a scoop of 25g of protein in it. After my workout, I'll drink a 50g protein shake mixed with a scoop of Field of Greens. For lunch, I started using a food delivery service that delivers to my office. Each meal is 500 calories, and has roughly 50g of protein, 30g of carbs, and 15g or so of fats. For dinner I TRY to eat healthy for the most part, although that doesn't always go according to plan. I'll shoot for grilled chicken, veggies, and potatoes or rice or something. Although some nights I'll have a big heaping plate of spaghetti, or snag me a guacamole burrito from Del Taco. Or a California burrito from Rubios. Yummmm. I figure that if I eat healthy for the first two meals of the day then it's okay to screw around for dinner every now and again. I've cut out sweets almost entirely. Well, sometimes on Saturdays I'll have a cookie or two but that's IT. Saturdays I'll basically eat what I want, but I do make sure to keep the calories to a minimum, as it's my only rest day.

At the end of the day, the most important thing to me when it comes to a diet routine is doing something I can stick with LONG TERM, if not indefinitely. My current routine meets those requirements; I'm actually able to stick with it quite easily. I just hope it's sufficient to get the results I want &amp; that I won't have to further limit myself. Only time will tell!

&amp;#x200B;

So there's where I'm at after almost 19 weeks. While I'm nowhere near my end goal in terms of physique, I'm in the best shape of my life and I feel great. Most importantly, I'm in a routine that I'm 100% certain I can stick with indefinitely. Now, I'm just not sure what to do next. I feel like I'm starting to plateau on my lifts (bench and squat). I'm not sure if it's because I need to consume more calories (I hope not as I'm trying to burn fat), if I need to change my workout routine, or if progression just happens at a much slower rate after the first couple months. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated!",t2_a23ca,False,,0,False,My 4 month transformation,[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_eg6pdi,False,dark,,public,2738,3,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2738,,False,,1577426686.0,,[],{},,True,,1577451917.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"Just got an Apple Watch for Christmas and I'm pretty overwhelmed by all the fitness tracking stuff. I wanted to see if anyone in the sub had some suggestions on what to try. Here are some things about what I want to track. 

In general, I want to be able to track time &amp; reps for run, swim, &amp; weight workouts. 

When I run, I usually either do a 400m sprint, followed by a 400m slow recover so I'd like to be able to track to lap times for each set. Pretty much same goes for swimming, 100m ""sprint"" followed by an active recovery period. The way I understand, is the GPS in the generic 'Workout' app should be able to automatically track time &amp; distance and know whenever I've completed a lap. I also do long runs/swims but I feel like those would be pretty straightforward to track. Historically, I've just used the chronograph on my timex then manually recorded each lap time but the idea behind the watch was so that I didn't have to do this anymore :) 

For weights, it would be nice if I was an app where I could create routines, so all I'd have to record in the watch is the reps &amp; weight that I perform. Again, I'm used to using the basic notepad but hoping I can move on from that.

I don't really care about steps, heart rate, calories, etc, anything else besides time/reps/weight. So right now I'm thinking I need to use the Apple 'Workout' tracker for cardio, then find a weight training app for the weights, but it would be nice if I could combine the two somehow.

I'm a very skinny person (184cm, 65kg, 27 yo male) and I've decided, about 4 months ago to start improving my physical condition.

While I can see already some good results on my performance and even appearance, I'm a bit confused about how my training is being designed (by my personal trainer). I essentially have a more intense session with her (let's say, upper body) and then I'll do a lighter version of it until the next appointment. Next one we do lower body and then I do about a week of the same lower body routine until we meet again.

Is it ok that I'm doing the same every day for periods of 7 days? I'm thinking it might be just because I'm such a beginner that, at the level I do it, it doesn't matter, but I'm also curious about whether or not I should raise that question to my personal trainer and start maybe rotating muscles to get better results.

,Fitness,"Happy Howdydays everyone!

For the last year, we've been running the [Community Campfire](https://thefitness.wiki/resources/community-campfires/) thread series and it's been a pretty resounding success that has contributed a lot of great information to our community resources in an organized way. But, we've reached a point where all the reasonable topics that fit within the scope of the Campfires have been covered, and it's time to ~~take them out behind the shed~~ retire them.

For 2020, we're going to be building on the Campfire concept with a new series of community discussion threads - Routine Campfires! Every two weeks, we'll focus on one routine from the Recommended Routines page, and the Campfire thread will be a place for anybody to ask any question they have about that routine specifically. These threads will be stickied just as the Community Campfires were to help them keep attention. A comment in the thread itself will also be stickied that will have an index of links to questions within the thread, so it's easier to navigate for anyone who comes to it in the future.

I haven't worked out the full schedule yet, but the first Campfire will get - fired up - on **January 6th**, and since it's New Year's Resolution season it seems appropriate for the very first one to cover the [r/Fitness Basic Beginner Routine](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/). On January 20th, we'll move forward from there. I'll update this thread with the schedule once I've got it all written down.

In the meantime, I'll leave this thread open for any questions, discussion, or praise of my genius that anyone wants to share.

Cheers!

&lt;p&gt;For the last year, we&amp;#39;ve been running the &lt;a href=""https://thefitness.wiki/resources/community-campfires/""&gt;Community Campfire&lt;/a&gt; thread series and it&amp;#39;s been a pretty resounding success that has contributed a lot of great information to our community resources in an organized way. But, we&amp;#39;ve reached a point where all the reasonable topics that fit within the scope of the Campfires have been covered, and it&amp;#39;s time to &lt;del&gt;take them out behind the shed&lt;/del&gt; retire them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2020, we&amp;#39;re going to be building on the Campfire concept with a new series of community discussion threads - Routine Campfires! Every two weeks, we&amp;#39;ll focus on one routine from the Recommended Routines page, and the Campfire thread will be a place for anybody to ask any question they have about that routine specifically. These threads will be stickied just as the Community Campfires were to help them keep attention. A comment in the thread itself will also be stickied that will have an index of links to questions within the thread, so it&amp;#39;s easier to navigate for anyone who comes to it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t worked out the full schedule yet, but the first Campfire will get - fired up - on &lt;strong&gt;January 6th&lt;/strong&gt;, and since it&amp;#39;s New Year&amp;#39;s Resolution season it seems appropriate for the very first one to cover the &lt;a href=""https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/""&gt;r/Fitness Basic Beginner Routine&lt;/a&gt;. On January 20th, we&amp;#39;ll move forward from there. I&amp;#39;ll update this thread with the schedule once I&amp;#39;ve got it all written down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&amp;#39;ll leave this thread open for any questions, discussion, or praise of my genius that anyone wants to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

Should I start with rack pulls then slowly move to deadlifts? Am I losing out on anything from doing that? Also, will I ever be able to deadlift after working on rack pulls or am I forever cursed with awkward deadlifts?

Edit: some seem to think this is just me whining in an attempt to excuse myself from doing a deadlift. This was simply a question, more or less, to see how other tall people deal with this. The consensus seems to be that hex bar and rack pulls are fine. Deadlifts will always feel odd and practice makes perfect.

,Fitness,"Hello, everyone. Hope you are all having a wonderful Christmas season. It is a time for family to get together as well as eat a lot of food. However, I hope everyone has been keeping fit. As usual, I've collected a few, very recent studies about fitness, health and nutrition to condense them into easy-to-read summaries for all of you. I hope to create some discussion below! Any tips for writing, presentation, analysis or anything else would be greatly appreciated. Enjoy!

Squat depth is a contentious subject in the fitness literature due to its uncertainties in the context of injury risk, muscle hypertrophy, strength gains, translation into sports performance and more. The literature teeters to both ends of the spectrum as Hartmann et al. (2012) showed superior functional adaptations for the full squat when compared to shallower squats. However, more recently, Rhea et al. (2016) found that quarter squats may actually be better for improving sprinting and jumping. Thus, Pallarés et al. (2019) sought to clear up the doubt by comparing full squats, parallel squats and half squats with the following outcomes in mind: one repetition maximum, maximum propulsive velocity, jump tests, sprint tests, Wingate tests as well as physical disability measurements as a proxy for injury risk. Let’s just quickly go over what some of this means. A full squat in the context of this study is a very deep squat where the thighs meet the calves on the descent. A parallel squat is where the crease made at the groin is in line with the top of the knee. A half squat is descending until your knee joint forms a 90deg angle. The outcomes will be explained as we go along.

50 men with a squat training history were recruited and split into four groups: full squat, parallel squat, half squat and a control group. The control group obviously did not partake in any resistance training so we can see if external factors that are not being measured are at play. Training was twice a week for ten weeks and the load slowly increased from 60% to 80% of their one repetition maximum. Participants did 4–5 sets of 4–8 repetitions with four minutes of rest between sets. An interesting aspect of this study is that instead of determining one repetition maxima traditionally (lifting heavier and heavier until you cannot lift against the resistance, essentially paying attention to the load lifted), they used mean propulsive velocity which just means they measured the speed at which the bar moves and once it slows enough, we have determined the one repetition maximum. This is better because we can track objective variables and numbers here. Using this velocity-based method is valid as it was used in a study with the same lifts recently and it showed a close relationship with the traditional, load-based method (Martínez-Cava et al., 2019). Several familiarization sessions were done to learn the exercises before the ten week training programme began.

The full squat group saw improvements across all outcomes. They increased their one repetition maximum in all three types of squats. They had better sprints and jumps as well as better Wingate test results. The wingate test is essentially a test for power (work done over time) on a cycling machine. The parallel squat group had similar results to the full squat group though to smaller extents. The half squat group made did not make great strength gains even for the half squat one repetition maximum. The power hardly changed and the peak power actually decreased. Jump heights improved slightly however, the sprint times were unchanged. The half squat group actually saw the worst results when it came to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a series of likert scales (ratings of subjective feeling) initially used in hospitals to evaluate pain, stiffness and functional disability in osteoarthritis (joint degeneration, generally in knees, hips and hands) patients, however, it has been used for a wide variety of rheumatological disorders. The half squat group saw large increases in all variables measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, unlike the other groups. Deeper squats may not have an increased knee injury risk despite higher knee flexion angles because of various reasons. The wrapping effect is a mechanism in which the quadriceps tendon makes better contact with the femur as we descend further in the squat rendering the knee joint more stable. The soft-tissue contact between the calf and the thigh in a deep squat may also provide support (Hartmann, Wirth &amp; Klusemann, 2013).

Like previous studies, there was a degree of specificity that came to light. Groups made the best strength gains at the depth they trained at. However, the full squat group still made better strength gains in the half squat if we make group to group comparisons. Another point to note is that the control group had several decrements in performance due to detraining. This further reinforces the idea that the trained population will suffer in performance after extended periods of sedentary lifestyle.

**TL;DR:** The deeper you go in a squat, the better your outcomes (strength, sprints, power, jumping) and this is likely without an increased risk for injury. (Reminder that this study was only done in trained men so keep that mind with application to populations).

Flexion of the lumbar spine (basically the spine segment located in the lower back) has long been thought to be associated with lower back pain. This has led to interventions in occupational health (“proper” biomechanics and use of braces) as well as in the fitness world especially in exercises such as the deadlift. However, is the association at hand really as strong as we think? Saraceni et al. (2019) very recently conducted a meta-analysis (pooling studies together) / review on the literature regarding this very question. They specifically aimed to see i) if lumbar flexion is a risk factor for lower back pain and ii) if the degree of lumbar flexion is different between those with or without lower back pain.
In total, they managed to gather 12 studies with a total of 697 participants for analysis. Overall, the quality of evidence was deemed to be low, however, there was no evidence to suggest that lumbar flexion was a risk factor for lower back pain though lumbar load may be a risk factor. To quote:

*“Critically, to date no study that has directly measured the lumbar spine during lifting, has found a relationship between LBP and greater lumbar flexion”*

People with lower back pain, on average, actually flexed slightly less at the lumbar spine when lifting. Unfortunately, this finding was clouded in heterogeneity which means that the papers that were pooled together in analysis were conducted so differently from each other that it becomes difficult to put them together. This finding may also be a result of reverse causality i.e: people with lower back pain flex less because of the pain, not the other way around. Careful applications of this study into resistance training world must be done as the maximum load of all the studies included was 12 kilograms.

**TL;DR:** No evidence to suggest a relationship between the degree of lumbar flexion and low back pain.

Blood flow restriction training is gaining more traction in the training world as more and more studies appreciate its efficacy. It is executed by partially occluding the targeted muscle(s)’ blood supply (via tourniquet or other means) and training with this occlusion. It has its place in recreational training as well as in rehabilitation as it allows healing joints/tissues to exercise with lighter loads while still reaping the benefits you would receive from higher loads. An important aspect to consider, however, is the effect of blood flow restriction training on the tendons involved. This is critical because if muscle adapts to a greater extent then its tendons do, an imbalance between the structures may lead to injury. Centner et al. (2019) took 38 untrained men and separated them into three groups: a group that trained with 70–85% of one repetition maximum loads with normal resistance training, a group with 20–35% of one repetition maximum loads with blood flow restricted training and one control group. The training groups followed their respective exercise programmes for 14 weeks. The traditional resistance training group did three sets of standing calf raises and three sets of sitting calf raises with 6–12 repetitions each. For the other group, the scheme was similar but one set of 30 repetitions was done before each exercise so in total eight sets would be done as opposed to six in the other group. 15 repetitions were done for the rest of the sets. The pressure used was set at a 50% occlusion and was kept on between sets but not between exercises. Training was held three times per week.

After 14 weeks, the achilles tendon (the tendon which joins the calf muscle to the ankle) cross-sectional area grew similarly between training groups. The same can be said about gastrocnemius (calf muscle) cross-sectional area, muscle stiffness and maximum voluntary torque (force produced by calf muscle). Young’s modulus changes (stress divided by strain, a property that tells us the stiffness of a material) was said to be statistically insignificant between and within groups though the high load training group had an increased Young’s modulus while the blood flow restricted group’s had decreased. Increases in stiffness are likely because of the increased size of the tendon rather than any changes in the material properties of the tendon. The tendon adaptations we find in the blood flow restricted group may be explained by the theory of metabolic stress inducing an increased production of fibroblasts, a cell which supports a tendon’s integrity by synthesizing collagen and other structural proteins.
A valuable part of the study that is missing is another group that trains with low loads but without blood flow occlusion as that would help isolate the variable of blood flow occlusion from other variables such as load. Another limitation that the authors highlighted was that the method of measuring tendon cross-sectional changes (via ultrasound) is not the most accurate technique especially when compared to sensitive procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

**TL;DR:** Positive tendon adaptations still occur in those who do blood flow restricted training (for young, untrained men).

Over the years, we have begun to realize that muscle hypertrophy does not require as much as we thought for it to occur. Low volumes, low frequencies, low repetitions, high rest — they all seem to work. Even intensities as low as 30% of your 1 repetition maximum are enough to induce hypertrophy (Mitchell et al., 2012). Can the same be said about muscle strength? Androulakis‑Korakakis, Fisher &amp; Steele (2019) performed a meta-analysis and review on the subject amassing six different studies total. It was found that volume as low as one set of 8–10 repetitions per week for 10 weeks was enough for muscle strength to increase. All sets in the studies were done to muscle failure. Most studies had some form of progression between training sessions. Loads were generally within the 70–90% 1 repetition maximum range so if strength changes can reliably occur at lower loads (&lt;60% 1 repetition maximum) is a question that still has yet to be answered. This point may be moot from an efficiency standpoint as working with lower loads would require higher repetitions to failure thus taking up more time.

We also do not know if we can get significant strength gains at repetitions lower than five to six assuming while still maintaining a frequency of one set per week. Furthermore, these findings are limited to the squat and bench press only, the deadlift unfortunately does not have enough research to make any concrete statements. Most of this data was gleaned from trained athletes, however, while they were technically “resistance-trained”, their personal records and training history would only be considered to be at an intermediate level from an advanced perspective. Despite having few studies to work with, all the studies were of high methodological quality. One final limitation is that these results can only be extrapolated to males. The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).

**TL;DR:** ""The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).”

With bodybuilding, it is often recommended to eat at a caloric surplus (ie. eating more calories than you burn daily) while training. This is sound advice because your body does need more energy for building the new tissue, maintaining the tissue and dealing with the altered metabolism that the body undergoes with training and muscle tissue accretion. However, there are a lot more variables that go into this and there is an immense amount of nuance. Slater et al. (2019) aimed to present and discuss all the variables as well as unravel all the confusion. Do we need a surplus in the first place? It would seem so given the theory above. Energy restrictions have been shown to interfere with muscle protein synthesis but this can be alleviated with training and a higher protein intake. So it is likely still possible to experience hypertrophy in a caloric deficit but this is probably only reasonably applicable to the overweight or untrained (more research needed!). Despite eating a caloric surplus being ubiquitous as a guideline, it is interesting to note that there is no controlled trial where they studied the relationship between a caloric surplus and muscle hypertrophy from resistance training over an extended period of time. However, we can look at overfeeding studies where participants are eating at a caloric surplus while not resistance training. In these studies, we do see gains in fat-free mass.

There are mathematical formulae out there to calculate what is the ideal surplus for your hypertrophy goals, however, no formulae takes into account all the complex biological processes that occur with muscle hypertrophy. These formulae are also based off of people who do not resistance train. Metabolism can be vastly different in athletes. For example, diet-induced thermogenesis (heat produced/calories burnt simply from eating) can be higher for athletes as their protein intakes are generally higher (takes more energy to digest protein). There is also the question of how you should distribute the surplus throughout the day or week. For example, carbohydrates may be good before or during high volume training yet there is no strong research in that area. Another common example is having a larger surplus on training days to make up for the training. The macronutrient distribution of the surplus is also relevant. The authors recommend 4–7 g/kg/day of carbohydrates, 35% of caloric intake with fat and 1.6 g/kg/day of protein. Three meals spread across the day with snacks interspersed between also appears to be effective. In total, a 360–480 daily calorie surplus seems to be an appropriate number to start with but it requires constant review throughout the training programme.

**TL;DR:** Not a lot is known about a caloric surplus and its effects on muscle hypertrophy while training. However, a small surplus of 360–480 kcal/day with appropriate macronutrient distribution appears to be a good starting point for most people wanting to build muscle.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Critically, to date no study that has directly measured the lumbar spine during lifting, has found a relationship between LBP and greater lumbar flexion”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with lower back pain, on average, actually flexed slightly less at the lumbar spine when lifting. Unfortunately, this finding was clouded in heterogeneity which means that the papers that were pooled together in analysis were conducted so differently from each other that it becomes difficult to put them together. This finding may also be a result of reverse causality i.e: people with lower back pain flex less because of the pain, not the other way around. Careful applications of this study into resistance training world must be done as the maximum load of all the studies included was 12 kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; No evidence to suggest a relationship between the degree of lumbar flexion and low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-——————-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood flow restriction training is gaining more traction in the training world as more and more studies appreciate its efficacy. It is executed by partially occluding the targeted muscle(s)’ blood supply (via tourniquet or other means) and training with this occlusion. It has its place in recreational training as well as in rehabilitation as it allows healing joints/tissues to exercise with lighter loads while still reaping the benefits you would receive from higher loads. An important aspect to consider, however, is the effect of blood flow restriction training on the tendons involved. This is critical because if muscle adapts to a greater extent then its tendons do, an imbalance between the structures may lead to injury. Centner et al. (2019) took 38 untrained men and separated them into three groups: a group that trained with 70–85% of one repetition maximum loads with normal resistance training, a group with 20–35% of one repetition maximum loads with blood flow restricted training and one control group. The training groups followed their respective exercise programmes for 14 weeks. The traditional resistance training group did three sets of standing calf raises and three sets of sitting calf raises with 6–12 repetitions each. For the other group, the scheme was similar but one set of 30 repetitions was done before each exercise so in total eight sets would be done as opposed to six in the other group. 15 repetitions were done for the rest of the sets. The pressure used was set at a 50% occlusion and was kept on between sets but not between exercises. Training was held three times per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 14 weeks, the achilles tendon (the tendon which joins the calf muscle to the ankle) cross-sectional area grew similarly between training groups. The same can be said about gastrocnemius (calf muscle) cross-sectional area, muscle stiffness and maximum voluntary torque (force produced by calf muscle). Young’s modulus changes (stress divided by strain, a property that tells us the stiffness of a material) was said to be statistically insignificant between and within groups though the high load training group had an increased Young’s modulus while the blood flow restricted group’s had decreased. Increases in stiffness are likely because of the increased size of the tendon rather than any changes in the material properties of the tendon. The tendon adaptations we find in the blood flow restricted group may be explained by the theory of metabolic stress inducing an increased production of fibroblasts, a cell which supports a tendon’s integrity by synthesizing collagen and other structural proteins.
A valuable part of the study that is missing is another group that trains with low loads but without blood flow occlusion as that would help isolate the variable of blood flow occlusion from other variables such as load. Another limitation that the authors highlighted was that the method of measuring tendon cross-sectional changes (via ultrasound) is not the most accurate technique especially when compared to sensitive procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Positive tendon adaptations still occur in those who do blood flow restricted training (for young, untrained men).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-——————-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we have begun to realize that muscle hypertrophy does not require as much as we thought for it to occur. Low volumes, low frequencies, low repetitions, high rest — they all seem to work. Even intensities as low as 30% of your 1 repetition maximum are enough to induce hypertrophy (Mitchell et al., 2012). Can the same be said about muscle strength? Androulakis‑Korakakis, Fisher &amp;amp; Steele (2019) performed a meta-analysis and review on the subject amassing six different studies total. It was found that volume as low as one set of 8–10 repetitions per week for 10 weeks was enough for muscle strength to increase. All sets in the studies were done to muscle failure. Most studies had some form of progression between training sessions. Loads were generally within the 70–90% 1 repetition maximum range so if strength changes can reliably occur at lower loads (&amp;lt;60% 1 repetition maximum) is a question that still has yet to be answered. This point may be moot from an efficiency standpoint as working with lower loads would require higher repetitions to failure thus taking up more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also do not know if we can get significant strength gains at repetitions lower than five to six assuming while still maintaining a frequency of one set per week. Furthermore, these findings are limited to the squat and bench press only, the deadlift unfortunately does not have enough research to make any concrete statements. Most of this data was gleaned from trained athletes, however, while they were technically “resistance-trained”, their personal records and training history would only be considered to be at an intermediate level from an advanced perspective. Despite having few studies to work with, all the studies were of high methodological quality. One final limitation is that these results can only be extrapolated to males. The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-————————&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With bodybuilding, it is often recommended to eat at a caloric surplus (ie. eating more calories than you burn daily) while training. This is sound advice because your body does need more energy for building the new tissue, maintaining the tissue and dealing with the altered metabolism that the body undergoes with training and muscle tissue accretion. However, there are a lot more variables that go into this and there is an immense amount of nuance. Slater et al. (2019) aimed to present and discuss all the variables as well as unravel all the confusion. Do we need a surplus in the first place? It would seem so given the theory above. Energy restrictions have been shown to interfere with muscle protein synthesis but this can be alleviated with training and a higher protein intake. So it is likely still possible to experience hypertrophy in a caloric deficit but this is probably only reasonably applicable to the overweight or untrained (more research needed!). Despite eating a caloric surplus being ubiquitous as a guideline, it is interesting to note that there is no controlled trial where they studied the relationship between a caloric surplus and muscle hypertrophy from resistance training over an extended period of time. However, we can look at overfeeding studies where participants are eating at a caloric surplus while not resistance training. In these studies, we do see gains in fat-free mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are mathematical formulae out there to calculate what is the ideal surplus for your hypertrophy goals, however, no formulae takes into account all the complex biological processes that occur with muscle hypertrophy. These formulae are also based off of people who do not resistance train. Metabolism can be vastly different in athletes. For example, diet-induced thermogenesis (heat produced/calories burnt simply from eating) can be higher for athletes as their protein intakes are generally higher (takes more energy to digest protein). There is also the question of how you should distribute the surplus throughout the day or week. For example, carbohydrates may be good before or during high volume training yet there is no strong research in that area. Another common example is having a larger surplus on training days to make up for the training. The macronutrient distribution of the surplus is also relevant. The authors recommend 4–7 g/kg/day of carbohydrates, 35% of caloric intake with fat and 1.6 g/kg/day of protein. Three meals spread across the day with snacks interspersed between also appears to be effective. In total, a 360–480 daily calorie surplus seems to be an appropriate number to start with but it requires constant review throughout the training programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Not a lot is known about a caloric surplus and its effects on muscle hypertrophy while training. However, a small surplus of 360–480 kcal/day with appropriate macronutrient distribution appears to be a good starting point for most people wanting to build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"To me, GtG is doing a single set well short of failure (50% max rep-count) several times a day, with a 15+ minute break between each set. The goal is to increase strength, with a big focus on improving neuromuscular efficiency.

I really don't know anything about this, but:

1) Isn't there a limit to how much you can improve neuromuscular efficiency? Especially as you become a more advanced athlete, surely your NM efficiency is already really high? Although I recently saw Devon Larrat (armwrestler) describe his new training routine, I'm not sure if he knows GtG exists but recently he's being doing 4 sessions of low rep count sets throughout the day with long rests, and he says it's been great for improving his strength. He's been armwrestling for 20 years.

2) Is GtG effective at building muscles, gaining mass, causing hypetrophy? This links with (1), sure it's great to become stronger but aren't you going to reach a point where the answer is 'more muscle fibers'?

3) Does GtG have a place is body building, where high reps, close to failure, seem to be favoured?

With this is mind, who is GtG for? And who is unlikely to need it at all?",t2_ggbx5,False,,0,False,How can 'Greasing the Groove' be incorporated in to a routine?,[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_efmldc,False,dark,,public,203,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,203,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1577340679.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, GtG is doing a single set well short of failure (50% max rep-count) several times a day, with a 15+ minute break between each set. The goal is to increase strength, with a big focus on improving neuromuscular efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t know anything about this, but:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Isn&amp;#39;t there a limit to how much you can improve neuromuscular efficiency? Especially as you become a more advanced athlete, surely your NM efficiency is already really high? Although I recently saw Devon Larrat (armwrestler) describe his new training routine, I&amp;#39;m not sure if he knows GtG exists but recently he&amp;#39;s being doing 4 sessions of low rep count sets throughout the day with long rests, and he says it&amp;#39;s been great for improving his strength. He&amp;#39;s been armwrestling for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Is GtG effective at building muscles, gaining mass, causing hypetrophy? This links with (1), sure it&amp;#39;s great to become stronger but aren&amp;#39;t you going to reach a point where the answer is &amp;#39;more muscle fibers&amp;#39;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Does GtG have a place is body building, where high reps, close to failure, seem to be favoured?&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"##Stats and pics

M22 5'9, [bulked 156 - 170 lbs from June '19 till december '19](https://imgur.com/a/3wVMJXJ) after a [cut 196lbs to 156lbs from dec '18 till June '19](https://imgur.com/a/HzyBLI9)(without working out though, unfortunately). 

Current 1rms estimates are:

S/B/D 210/200/240, and OHP/pendlay row 125/180.

##Cut

During the cut I ate around 1400kcal, started learning better healthy habbits, cooking for myself, etc...

Had high load in university so didn't start working out, although I could have probably made time now that I look at it. But I did start looking for routines so I could dive right in after the semester ends. Also watching and reading more fitnesd related stuff.

##Bulk

Overestimated TDEE at first, shot for about 2500kcal. As you can see from the pics, gained more fat than I'd like, so readjusted for about 2200kcal.

Right now I'm more of a recomp at 1900-2000 a day though.

,Fitness,"Hey everyone, 

**Age**: 25M

**Training Age**: 7 Years

**Bodyweight**: 83KG

I am 5 foot 11 inches and I have arms which extend to about an inch above my knees. I appreciate that's not helpful because I am not mentioning my full wingspan, but let's say I bench with my middle finger on the outer ring of the barbell.

Following the normal powerlifting style training for a number of years has left me with a pretty odd physique. Huge chest, small shoulders, small arms, big lats and spinal erectors.

I had a photo taken of me recently and I realised how bad I look with such a chest dominated physique so I am planning to use 2020 to switch to a more bodybuilding style of training.

I want to focus more on:

\- OHP

\- Close Grip Bench Press

\- Triceps and Biceps

And less on:

\- Competition bench (replacing it with CGBP)

Does this sound like a good idea? Does anyone have any experience training with long arms?

,Fitness,"41/M /5ft 7 / 234lbs - 200lbs

Soo here's my story about how my life changed :). 6 years ago i was blessed with the birth of my youngest daughter and shortly after her birth i was cursed with a dislocated knee and MCL issue. I was a long distance runner averaging roughly about 90-100 miles a week. Since i was healing and spending time bonding with my daughter I kept eating like i was still running and not. Be hold 5 years later I went from 160lbs to 234lbs... I guess we can call that a dirty bulk? Either way june of this year my dad went in for heart surgery and I told myself enough is enough. Running didn't sound fun but a buddy of mine is a first responded and avid Cross-fitter. We chatted a lot about the benefits of strength training and it appealed to me. Since i'm not in my 20's any more and i like the time spent with my kids 1-1.5 hours at the gym seemed way more acceptable (plus there's a drop area for them) any ways it's not the crazy transformations you see within 6 months but i'm proud and I can still knock down a sub 20 minute 5k ;).

Here's the information on what i've done plus pictures.

Photo:  [https://imgur.com/a/uVBJTh6](https://imgur.com/a/uVBJTh6)

Diet: I don't really count or look at my macro's. what' i've done is portion less and do a Paleo diet with intermittent fasting.

Workout: I'm on a 4 day split routine. I go to the gym 7 days a week but every 5th day is mobility workouts and 40 minutes of cardio. I don't know what my body fat % is as I'm not really trying to shred just lift and have fun. I'll probably try to shred in February or march once all the new years resolutions have melted away from the gym.

TLDR: Ex injured runner decided to do something about the Dad bod and went to the gym. He is now happy.

Edit: Photo from back when i was at my peak running https://imgur.com/awpKmp7",t2_r29wn,False,,0,False,6 Month progress and getting ready for the new year.,[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_eerues,False,dark,,public,31,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,31,,False,,1577200681.0,,[],{},,True,,1577169595.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;41/M /5ft 7 / 234lbs - 200lbs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soo here&amp;#39;s my story about how my life changed :). 6 years ago i was blessed with the birth of my youngest daughter and shortly after her birth i was cursed with a dislocated knee and MCL issue. I was a long distance runner averaging roughly about 90-100 miles a week. Since i was healing and spending time bonding with my daughter I kept eating like i was still running and not. Be hold 5 years later I went from 160lbs to 234lbs... I guess we can call that a dirty bulk? Either way june of this year my dad went in for heart surgery and I told myself enough is enough. Running didn&amp;#39;t sound fun but a buddy of mine is a first responded and avid Cross-fitter. We chatted a lot about the benefits of strength training and it appealed to me. Since i&amp;#39;m not in my 20&amp;#39;s any more and i like the time spent with my kids 1-1.5 hours at the gym seemed way more acceptable (plus there&amp;#39;s a drop area for them) any ways it&amp;#39;s not the crazy transformations you see within 6 months but i&amp;#39;m proud and I can still knock down a sub 20 minute 5k ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the information on what i&amp;#39;ve done plus pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photo:  &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/uVBJTh6""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/uVBJTh6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diet: I don&amp;#39;t really count or look at my macro&amp;#39;s. what&amp;#39; i&amp;#39;ve done is portion less and do a Paleo diet with intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workout: I&amp;#39;m on a 4 day split routine. I go to the gym 7 days a week but every 5th day is mobility workouts and 40 minutes of cardio. I don&amp;#39;t know what my body fat % is as I&amp;#39;m not really trying to shred just lift and have fun. I&amp;#39;ll probably try to shred in February or march once all the new years resolutions have melted away from the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

This is not a ""holy shit"" transformation story but its one im proud of. I believe I have made largely lean gains, and it seems bizarre that I would have better ab definition with an added 6/7kgs. I see a lot of insane transformations on reddit so i wanted to post one for the average guys

&amp;#x200B;

**Numbers**

Starting: M / 21 / 6ft 1 (185cm) / 63kg (138lbs)

Ending: M / 22 / 6ft1 (185cm) / 69.5kg (153lbs)

Duration: September 2018 - December 2019 (15 months)

&amp;#x200B;

Start lifts: the bar

End lifts: all 3 x 5 max (i havent trained 1RM)

* DL: 120kg (264lbs)
* Squat: 90kg (198lbs)
* Bench, dumbbells: 28kg (61lbs)

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

I played a lot of sport growing up, something like 5 - 6 hours hockey per week + tennis or football every lunch + 1-2 hours badminton a week. Knowing what I now know about nutrition, I estimate my calorie intake growing up to have been 2000 - 2400 calories a day, hence a substantial caloric deficit

In summer 2015 I lifted weights with 2 friends for about 2 - 3 months. It was absolutely dreadful in terms of quality / discipline and consistency. I doubt I put on a pound of muscle in that period and its a nice reminder that lifting did not come easily to me

&amp;#x200B;

**Routine**

September 2018 I followed a nice, crappy **fuckarounditis** for 6 weeks, some routine of BB forum. Do not follow this step

Late October 2018 I begun **Greyskull LP** which I absolutely would recommend to any beginner. I saw great gains, good strength progress and it was a great balance between volume and intensity. During this time I did cardio twice a week, always a rowing workout (variants of 2ks, 1ks) + abs (8 minute abs video off Youtube)

March 2019 I moved to **Reddit PPL** which I am still on. Here is a link to the workout:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a\_linear\_progression\_based\_ppl\_program\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) which explains it better than i can

At this point I was pretty serious about fitness so I welcomed the extra time in the gym. I made a few modifications but otherwise followed the template exactly:

1. I alternate weighted pull ups (5x5) with bodyweight pullups (3x failure) on pull days
2. I add shrugs to push day, between incline bench and tricep isolations
3. Added barbell hip thrusts (3 x 12) between RDLs and leg press and damn I could not recommend this addition enough
4. Replaced barbell bench press with dumbbells. This was simply because my gym was too busy and the waiting time was infuriating. In any case I really enjoy dumbbell bench, especially the stretch right at the bottom. But in due course I will change back to barbell bench

I still play badminton / squash about 2 - 4 hours a week and do cardio once a week which involves a 20 min run, 8 minute abs workout ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWjTnBmCHTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWjTnBmCHTY)) and do farmers walks (3 sets of walking a certain route in my gym with heavy dumbbells).

&amp;#x200B;

**Diet**

Obivously this was the big ""change"" I needed to make. I now eat **3200-3600 calories a day,** with 3600 calories on days I play squash

I do not aim for specific macro targets. I simply eat 2 meals with protein per day + two protein shakes, and stuff myself full of veggies and fruit each day (often hit 10+ per day)

""Standard day"" eating:

Breakfast: 3 eggs + 2 pieces brown bread, orange juice

2 protein shakes (one before gym, one after) each containing: 200ml milk, 50g greek yoghurt, 20g peanut butter, 20g ground oats, 1 scoop gold standard whey

Lunch: a vegatarian sandwhich / roll / bagel etc. + falafel + various salads

Dinner: whatever is going, just 600cals minimum. Faves include tuna sweetcorn mayo pasta, salmon and potatoes, curries and stir fries are easy to just add nuts, seeds, sauces to and get the calories up

Snacks: apple, banana, raisins every day + avocado, peanuts, cereal bar, bowl of cereal, malt loaf, whatever is needed for the target that day

For the first 10 months I used my fitness pal to track my calories and weighed most of the food i ate, every day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Weight gain**

I weigh myself every morning, same conditions. Here is a photo of my weight change, to give you an idea of how up and down my progress really was: [https://imgur.com/a/80WwH3N](https://imgur.com/a/80WwH3N) (the first reading was in august 2018, before i started lifting)

Caveat: I went on several hiking trips over the last 12 months which explain the sharp drops in weight - I would come back 2/3 kgs lighter, but a decent chunk of the weight loss was water weight + glycogen (from not taking creatine).

&amp;#x200B;

**Things I wish i had known before I started** (mostly directed at tall skinny guys, sorry):

1. Starting skinny is in some ways a blessing in disguise. Every pound of muscle you put on will be nice and visible. And more importantly you can slowly, steadily bulk for months or years, which translates to more energy, all the time
2. If your grip starts failing you in DLs, try using the smaller barbell (15kg in my gym), its easier to grip. And then change to hook grip, I wish I had done this far earlier
3. Take better before / progress photos than I did. From lots of angles, lightings, poses etc. it feels a bit funny at first but its worth it. And dont throw away your old t shirts
4. Counting calories was absolutely non-negotiable (along with face pulls) at the start
5. Dont tell a group of girls you eat 3500 calories a day. RIP.
6. The barbell will hurt your back during squats. It took me about 8 months to get enough ""meat"" and feel of the bar for it to sit comfortably, you just have to perservere through
7. Asian squatting every day for several minues was extremely effective in improving my hip mobility and squat technique

&amp;#x200B;

**Going forward**

I will keep lean bulking for the foreseeable, probably another year at least. Long term, I would like to transition into calisthenics because i think some of those moves are fucking cool. But not until I have built some appreciable muscle mass. In terms of realistic strength goals, Id like to bench my BW, squat 1.5x and DL 2x my BW.

But not until I have built some appreciable muscle mass. In terms of realistic strength goals, Id like to bench my BW, squat 1.5x and DL 2x my BW. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

19 yo/male, 76 kg, 176 cm, here.

Started my journey 3 months ago, at the end of august at about 84 kg. Now i'm down to 76 kg, and have gained quite a bit of muscle as well using the PPL reddit program!

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, does my deficit HAVE to be consistent every day? My maintenance is around 2700, and i eat about 1800-2200 calories a day. As long as i'm getting enough protein in, will it affect anything? I dont starve myself or anything, sometimes i just seem to land around 1800 ish, and sometimes i'm around 2100+.

I've recently been taking barre classes. In the classes, we use resistance bands. They're placed anywhere from our thighs, calves, or even wrists for various movements. 

However, I currently have some pretty big thighs. (It's definitely not a bad thing, I'm working on it, but it's not a bad thing.) Something I struggle with is that I find that lots of time during the moments are spent fixing the band since they seem to roll if I move in certain ways, so it ends up taking away from my workout.

,Fitness,"I'm planning on helping my wife get in shape. Right now she can't curl more than 5 lbs, and bench more than 25 so at a very beginner state. She wants to get in shape, is currently going to a personal trainer but says its too expensive, so I'm coming up with an alternate plan. 

The goal is to recomp and build primarily strength and some cardio. On the diet side, adjusting protein intake to 0.7g / lb.

I'm thinking of two options

**Option 1 - a variety of classes before ramping up to strength training**

1x a week kettlebell class - seems like its low impact and can get her skills in a tool that can get a workout in very quickly

2x a week TRX class - lower impact, not as demanding as lifts, and if she learns these skills she can get a session in wherever we go

1x a week some form of cardio

Daily stretching and foam rolling with me - start working on mobility

Do this until the workouts become very doable, and then add a 1x a week full body lifting session with me where I train her on all the lifts (3x5 squat, dead, press and bench).

This eventually transitions (after a few months) to a 3x a week starting weightlifting program + cardio on off days when possible

**Option 2 - linear progression immediately**

Dive into a beginner linear progression weight lifting program right away and start the progressive overload on day 1. 

Option 2 seems the most straightforward with the fastest gains. The reason I am hesitant on 2 is that someone who is not trained might have mobility issues, strength imbalances, may not be able to push hard enough, etc and she may benefit from a slower ramp up and varied instruction from others. However if the goal is to build strength option 2 is probably a lot faster 

What do you all think?

Edit: thanks for the feedback. I think asking what the trainer is doing is a good idea, I actually don’t know and should probably find out.

Her goals are not that concrete, I think we can narrow down on them more.

I leaned towards strength training because that’s what I know and can coach. Actually haven’t done much else other than snowboarding and cycling. But I get the feedback that only do it if she’s into it. That was my hesitation from starting option 2 right away as well, there’s this gap from newb to powerlifting that seems like it needs to be bridged

Back at the gym. Yesterday I saw my nutritian and had some good results like losing 6 pounds of fat including visceral and reduce belly circumference. But most of my loss was muscle.

 My nutritian told me that it is not possible to gain muscle on a fat loss diet. And I'm heavily worried about keep losing muscle.

(Sorry for bad English and or mistakes) 

Hey guys. I’ve been putting off losing weight for an extremely long time. I’ve struggled with my body since junior high. I’m now 24, 5’10 and 215 pounds at 26% body fat and recently have decided to make a change for the better 

I told myself at the beginning of the month that I am going to make a difference and not wait for a “New Years resolution” to start. I know half of the battle is diet, and I’ve gotten it down to the T. 

I track my food intake daily and make sure I hit my macros in my 1750 calorie intake at 30% fat, 40% protein 30%carbs. And I do make sure it’s lean protein, good fats (avocados), and good carbs (oatmeal, sweet potatoes, etc...).  I’ve lost 5 pounds already just from diet alone this month. 


I know that diet is over half the battle, which bring me to the other part: working out. 

I tried to incorporate an expert bodyspace gym plan (in my head higher intensity will yield better results). It was the Kris gethin workout and I hit it hard as I could for day 1. Two days later and I can’t extend my arms. I had to miss yesterday’s session because of it (still did cardio though). I did do a warmup and cool down cardio session of 10 minutes each. But I didn’t stretch for too long, maybe that was the issue?


Any tips on what workout plans would be good for me? My main goal is to lose fat but I’d like to keep my muscle if possible. I know you lose some lean mass on a cut though. 
I’ve been reading that beginners to the gym should should do full body workouts to maximize gains since they’re newer but I’d like to hear your thoughts.


Extra info:

-my supplements only consist of whey protein and creatine. Let me know if I should pick other stuff up

Edit: Thank you everyone for the overwhelming support. I’ll start by setting up miniature goals first. Changing my diet is gonna be hard. A lot of you guys are saying that I should just cut back and not completely cut off the tempting unhealthy food all the while introducing new healthy foods into my diet. I’ve been thinking about trying out the 1 free personal trainer session at the gym and ask them about some tips. I have to come up with a workout schedule that is suited for my current body and then gradually pick up the pace. From what a lot of people are saying is try not to go too hard in the first few weeks and try to find what my limits are while gradually losing the weight and then that’s when I can go more intense with the workout. I thank everyone in this sub for helping me start my journey. Thank you.

I’m about to head to the gym for the first time in years tomorrow and I don’t know what my limit is or how hard should I push myself. I just want to lose this fat and return to the weight of my teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you everyone for the overwhelming support. I’ll start by setting up miniature goals first. Changing my diet is gonna be hard. A lot of you guys are saying that I should just cut back and not completely cut off the tempting unhealthy food all the while introducing new healthy foods into my diet. I’ve been thinking about trying out the 1 free personal trainer session at the gym and ask them about some tips. I have to come up with a workout schedule that is suited for my current body and then gradually pick up the pace. From what a lot of people are saying is try not to go too hard in the first few weeks and try to find what my limits are while gradually losing the weight and then that’s when I can go more intense with the workout. I thank everyone in this sub for helping me start my journey. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I also feel as though I should give everyone more info about me to get even more advice. I’m 25(M), weigh 311Ib, 6’1”, and I have job that does keep me active outside. By active I mean that I’m on my feet most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: So I finally went to the gym today! Only to find out they were closing in 10 mins. So used this time wisely and decided to schedule my free personal trainer session and ask about their classes and what not. I’m actually quite excited now.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello everyone,

I am a 33M that has started working out now for the first time in my life. During my live I have always been very skinny and my weight has always been around 150 lbs (68 kg) to 158 lbs (72 kg), which I think it is quite low for my height (6'3''/191 cm). My diet was always very bad (sweets, skipping meals, etc.) and I was very sedentary (maybe once a week some team sports). I decided it was time to change this. Funnily, I found my motivation in philosophy when I read what Socrates said ""It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable"".

**Exercise routine**

I started for two months doing the beginners routine and then switched to GCZLP (3 days) for 3 months. On GCZLP I did the barebone routine of the wiki (1T1, 1T2, 1T3) and midway I added some extra T3s (mostly biceps/triceps 2 days and extra leg work the other 2 days). Not sure if that was the best but I thought it was better than nothing. I could progress adding 5lbs/2.5kg and 10lbs/5kg to upper and lower lifts every week. I started very low on lower lifts because I wanted to be sure on the form. On upper lifts I had to switch to 6x2 at the end. My caculated 1RMs at the end of the 3 months (2 weeks ago) where:

Bench 145lbs 66.5kg

Squat 175lbs 80kg

Deadlift 210lbs 95kg

OHP 100lbs 45kg

I know, I am very very weak still but I feel I was much weaker at the beginning (I couldn't barely lift the barbell on the OHP).

I also tried to do some abs work 1 or 2 times per week. Basically a circuit of plank variations for 25 minutes (I got a previous injury in the groin section of the abs and the PT told me that I should never do crunches, that it was better to do planks).

Sometimes because of work/travel I couldn't hit the gym and follow the program closely. I would then improvise: one-day trial gym, hotel gym, dumbell and bodyweight exercises at home, taking some bands with me... always with the thought in mind of ""better suboptimal training than skipping it"".

After GCZLP I took a week off and last week I started with PHUL. Lots of new exercises, it is pretty exciting and motivating for me.

**Diet**

I calculated my TDEE and eated at a surplus about 3000 kcal (of which 150-200 g proteins). I spent a couple months tracking closely the calories and macros on myfitnesspal to get a feel of what does each food means. This was not sustainable for me so now I do it a bit more approximated. I feel my approach is still working (my weight increase is steady) but it is not a burden for me. Every time I have been trying to move more towards plant protein based diet. I meal prep for the whole week so usually I make two dishes and that's what I eat for lunch/dinner all the week. I cook exclusively with olive oil. I can have one or two junk meal foods a week. I didn't drink much before (maybe 2-4 drinks a week) but now I drink even less (1-2 drinks a month).

Typical food day:

Breakfast: 3 eggs, milk (first cow, then soja) with a scoop of weight gainer, 2 dark bread toasts

Lunch: Pasta with some sauce, (vegan) meatballs and veggies or beef stew with veggies and white rice

Post-training: a banana and a protein shake (1 scoop on soja milk)

Dinner: (Vegan) meat with fries and veggies or salmon with rice and veggies

Before sleep: one glass of milk and some nuts

During the day: I try to take 3 fruits a day and I am constantly snacking on nuts, sometimes I add a toast with peanut butter and ocassionaly some chocolate.

Supplements: none

**Sleep**

I found this to be very important for me. I sleep usually 7h30 a day, aiming always for 8h. Really, sleeping is so so important, it has changed my life.

**General feeling**

I really feel more healthy and with more energy during the day (except after hitting the gym where sometimes I want to kill myself). My abs injury doesn't hurt anymore, before it used to hurt from time to time. Also less back pain that I had from time to time. All in all I am very happy to have moved towards this direction, and I know that I might not be the most disciplined and my gains won't be the most impressive but I am very happy!

**Where to go from here**

I want to keep gaining weight and to complete 3 months of the PHUL program.

I would like to be more strict on the abs routine. How to define them? Is it possible to do it for someone like me? I feel my routine is very random. Is there any routine out there that you recommend?

I also feel (and know) my mobility/flexibility is very bad. I am stiff as a stick. Is there any kind of recommendation to improve on that direction? Any ""workout"" plan I could do at night for 15-30 min before going to sleep?

Thanks for reading till the end and happy lifting!",t2_sfgib,False,,0,False,"33M, 6'3'' (191 cm), 157 lbs (71 kg) -&gt; 172 lbs (78 kg), 5.5 months progress with pics",[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_ed9pt7,False,dark,,public,22,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,22,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1576874587.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before &amp;amp; After Pics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before sleep: one glass of milk and some nuts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day: I try to take 3 fruits a day and I am constantly snacking on nuts, sometimes I add a toast with peanut butter and ocassionaly some chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplements: none&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this to be very important for me. I sleep usually 7h30 a day, aiming always for 8h. Really, sleeping is so so important, it has changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General feeling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really feel more healthy and with more energy during the day (except after hitting the gym where sometimes I want to kill myself). My abs injury doesn&amp;#39;t hurt anymore, before it used to hurt from time to time. Also less back pain that I had from time to time. All in all I am very happy to have moved towards this direction, and I know that I might not be the most disciplined and my gains won&amp;#39;t be the most impressive but I am very happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to go from here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to keep gaining weight and to complete 3 months of the PHUL program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to be more strict on the abs routine. How to define them? Is it possible to do it for someone like me? I feel my routine is very random. Is there any routine out there that you recommend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel (and know) my mobility/flexibility is very bad. I am stiff as a stick. Is there any kind of recommendation to improve on that direction? Any &amp;quot;workout&amp;quot; plan I could do at night for 15-30 min before going to sleep?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading till the end and happy lifting!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been weight training sporadically since 15 but the strongest I've been since recently was senior year of high school when I had gym class. My total then was probably a higher then that listed for my previous total in the above table while also at a weight of 147 lbs. My first experiment with powerlifting was with the Stronglifts 5x5 program beginning august of 2018. I felt that I stagnated quickly then my motivation left me and I made no progress. I made a new years resolution to try to seriously build strength as opposed to lifting for aesthetic purposes and picked up the nSuns 4-day program when I was 18. This program involves a 5/3/1 progression with a main lift (such as those tabulated above) and then 6 deload sets. Following this, there are 8 sets of a secondary lift such as sumo, front squat, etc. then accessories as I see fit. My attendance was rocky initially but I was weak enough then to still make consistent progress. 

The clear progression proved addictive and soon enough my attendance improved. A stalling OHP (it is only included as an accessory lift in the 4-day program) caused me to switch to the nSuns 5-day program sometime in April as it had a day with OHP as the main lift. This worked very well. While I tried to continue with the accessory work around august I had dropped it entirely unless I was injured.

**Diet:**

Literally whatever. I probably get around 3000 calories a day on average, usually anywhere from 2500-4000. I try and get a good amount of protein in but I barely ever even tracked macros.

**Injuries:**

I don't let injuries stop me from going to the gym but they do change what I focus on. There were 5 weeks this fall where I didn't do bench press due to what I believe to be elbow tendinitis and 2 weeks where I didn't OHP because my rear delt/ rotator cuff felt tight. I stopped doing weighted pull ups all together because of the elbow pain. While my injuries were never severe I was mindful of aggravating them. I would do lighter cable or dumbbell exercises such as delt raises, cable flys and tricep extensions when I felt injured.

**Supplements/ Equipment:**

I lift in a pair of busted van lows. I added a belt for squat and deadlift in late august. I didn't feel much difference in my deadlift but my squat feels much more stable in the hole. I think that improvement of my lifting form probably contributed more to my total than the belt. I supplement with creatine (5g a day when I take it), a multivitamin, preworkout, and protein powder. The creatine and protein powder I don't get around to taking too often anymore but I was pretty consistent over the summer.

**Sleep:**

Despite being in my senior year as an engineering student I try and usually succeed in getting at least 6.5 hrs a sleep on weekdays and more on the weekends despite classwork and grad school apps. I say I average around 7.5 hrs.

**Future Plans:**

I am part of the powerlifting club on my campus and will likely compete in their charity meet this next semester. I would like to achieve my estimated 1RMs in the gym and improve on them. I was planning on testing them over this week but finals got in the way more than I expected. I succeed in squatting 435 but failed at 455. I'm just short of my goal for the year  (an 1150 total). I would like a 1350 total by this time next year. I do not feel that I am stagnating yet so I am optimistic in achieving this goal. I'd also like to cut down to around 10% body fat throughout next year. I don't really care about being super big. I was planning to stay around 83kg so I could compete in that division of the USAPL in the future but I shot right past that weight.",t2_pw31a,False,,0,False,"19M 5'11"" 165 lbs (75 kg) -&gt; 192 lbs (87.3 kg) 12 months of progress",[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_ed0m4c,False,dark,,public,97,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,97,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1576823359.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after pics:   Before:  &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/u7waWSg""&gt;Front&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/nSTC4NY""&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;After:   &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/zE8VUzP""&gt;Front&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/uDP0UtU""&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lift in a pair of busted van lows. I added a belt for squat and deadlift in late august. I didn&amp;#39;t feel much difference in my deadlift but my squat feels much more stable in the hole. I think that improvement of my lifting form probably contributed more to my total than the belt. I supplement with creatine (5g a day when I take it), a multivitamin, preworkout, and protein powder. The creatine and protein powder I don&amp;#39;t get around to taking too often anymore but I was pretty consistent over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being in my senior year as an engineering student I try and usually succeed in getting at least 6.5 hrs a sleep on weekdays and more on the weekends despite classwork and grad school apps. I say I average around 7.5 hrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Plans:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am part of the powerlifting club on my campus and will likely compete in their charity meet this next semester. I would like to achieve my estimated 1RMs in the gym and improve on them. I was planning on testing them over this week but finals got in the way more than I expected. I succeed in squatting 435 but failed at 455. I&amp;#39;m just short of my goal for the year  (an 1150 total). I would like a 1350 total by this time next year. I do not feel that I am stagnating yet so I am optimistic in achieving this goal. I&amp;#39;d also like to cut down to around 10% body fat throughout next year. I don&amp;#39;t really care about being super big. I was planning to stay around 83kg so I could compete in that division of the USAPL in the future but I shot right past that weight.&lt;/p&gt;

James Krieger of Weightology (and recent [BF% post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/e4fldb/this_is_a_great_series_by_james_krieger_on/)) just released his ""Volume Bible"" on hypertrophy training.  

We've probably all heard ""[volume drives gains](https://i.imgur.com/7bOp283.jpg)"" a lot recently, and here, Dr. Krieger provides a thorough assessment of the evidence to suggest the best way to manipulate volume when training for size.  Mike Israetel has stated several times that Krieger's Volume Bible informs Renaissance Periodization's [Hypertrophy Training guidelines](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/hypertrophy-training-guide-central-hub/).  It's a beefy write-up to sink your teeth in, but the key takeways and tl;dr are upfront:

&gt;**TL;DR Version**

&gt;* On average, muscle growth tends to be best with around 8 sets per muscle group per training session in trained individuals. Frequency can be used to manipulate weekly volume.
&gt;* Individual results may vary widely from the average.
&gt;* 2-3 sets per muscle group per training session is sufficient for beginners.

I was always very skinny and I thought I can't eat enough to gain any significant weight, but I learned a lot about nutrition in the last 2 years and I was able to make pretty big improvement. However, some of the gains that were supposed to get absorbed by legs went to my beard instead.

I did gain muscle quite fast partially because I used to lift in the past (in my room with dumbells...) and used to weight about 72kg when I was 21, but after stopping I dropped back to 66,7kg (always was between 66-68kg). Thank you muscle memory.

---

**Diet**

Plenty of non-processed foods that are also rich in calories. About 1.5g protein/kg. I eat the same things over and over again, never grow tired of them thankfully.


Breakfast:

* Oatmeal, a lot of it (300g oats + 300ml milk) + banana + dark chocolate

* Greek yoghurt + banana + sunflower seeds

* Handful of walnuts
 
Lunch:

* Vegetable smoothie (kale, spinach, banana, frozen fruits, berries, lineseed for calories)

* Handful of pumpkin seeds

* 1-2 cans of sardines

Dinner:

* 300g chicken breast

* 100g cooked rice

* 240g cooked red kidney beans

* Frozen vegetables (green peas, carrots, corn, etc.)

* Nuts/ seeds

Supplements:

* Creatine powder
* Vitamin D3 + K2
* Hydrolized collagen powder

Sometimes I would eat something different alongside those. All I drink is tap water and black coffee without sugar twice a week.

If I travel and can't eat as much I still do by having nuts/seeds with me at all times which isn't difficult at all. Seriously just get seeds/ nuts they are healthy af and have a lot of calories.

---
**Workout routine**

First 6-7 months I was doing 5x5 Stronglifts slightly modified with Jeff's from Athlean X reccomendations (I swapped some risky excercises with those that made more sense, don't want to get injured).

I never cared about how much I can bench press, lift or squat as long as I was getting bigger. Currently all of those are somewhere between 70-80kg (154-176lbs). After I stopped getting bigger I switched to PPL and went to gym 4-6 times/ week during the last couple months. I prefer workout total volume over lots of weight. I find it easier to maintain proper form and I don't see a point in being stronger than I currently am. I am a pussy anyway and can't fight so what's the point (I bought some pepper spray).

When I'm at the gym I'm usually more preocuppied with Joe Rogan podcast I'm listening to that applying myself to working out extremely hard. Except for the leg day I don't even sweat that much to be honest. If I see my progress stopping I will consider looking into it. 

However, out of all the components I feel like it's far more important to have proper diet &amp; sleep and just be consistent with working out without worrying about the details too much. I'm just being careful not to injure myself.

---
**Sleep**

I get at least 8 hours of sleep each night. This is extremely important for me and for my wellbeing, helps a lot with gains as well. Watch dr. Matthew Walker on Joe Rogan podcast if you want to learn more about why sleep is crucial for human health.

**Going forward**

I might want to go lower on workout volume when it comes to my legs since they grow noticeably slower then my upper body and I read they might need more time to recover, so it might be more efficient to train them once a week instead of twice I guess. Calves refuse to grow, but my lower legs have been just bones my entire life. This doesn't bother me too much and since I got in shape I'm getting a lot of compliments and was able to find a girlfriend hence no masturbation lotion in the second picture, lol.

,Fitness,"Hi everyone,

I started weight training regularly a couple of months ago. My routine consists of 4-5 days of exercise a week: one day for chest/shoulders/triceps, one day for biceps/back, one day for glutes/hams, one day for quads. I also try to add an extra day in for yoga or cardio if my schedule allows for it and if I'm feeling up to it. 

Lately the day after an intense workout (I have been increasing weights/reps every week), I have been feeling completely fatigued and wiped out. Not just ""man I could really use a nap"" or ""I need a little extra caffeine this morning"". It was so bad on Monday that I asked my boss if I could leave work early- I just couldn't function. It's like my energy levels are totally depleted.

&lt;p&gt;I started weight training regularly a couple of months ago. My routine consists of 4-5 days of exercise a week: one day for chest/shoulders/triceps, one day for biceps/back, one day for glutes/hams, one day for quads. I also try to add an extra day in for yoga or cardio if my schedule allows for it and if I&amp;#39;m feeling up to it. &lt;/p&gt;

It was so bad on Monday that I asked my boss if I could leave work early- I just couldn&amp;#39;t function. It&amp;#39;s like my energy levels are totally depleted.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi! This is my first time venturing into this subreddit, and I tried to read everything I could before posting. I’ve been lifting for 4 years now, but really only trying for a solid 2.

The cardio would provide a significant amount of volume and intensity, but how do you factor that in to your additional weight training?

,Fitness,"Before: [https://imgur.com/82vxTlS](https://imgur.com/82vxTlS)

After: [https://imgur.com/9zeOI15](https://imgur.com/9zeOI15)

I was always known as the skinny one growing up, and used to wear it as a badge of pride. My friends and family would be so envious that I was so skinny and wondered how I did it (Ans: I just wasn't eating enough). I was inspired to start after reading a Nytimes article citing a study that we perceive our future selves as total strangers and this makes us make bad future decisions. I decided to help ""Future Me"" and decided to start exercising.

I initially hired a PT as I thought it would help with forcing me into the gym. After six sessions, I felt that I was just doing random exercises and thought it was a rather expensive waste of time. I felt motivated enough to go to the gym on my own already and I didn't need a PT for motivation. I went to reddit and found r/fitness. It was there that I seriously learnt about diet and exercise.

**Diet**

Based on a TDEE calculator, I try to hit about 2400 calories a day.

* Breakfast: I used to always skip my breakfast and still hate eating it. I drink my breakfast everyday. The shake is 400ml milk, 3/4 cup oats, 1 scoop protein, 2 teaspoons chia seeds and 1 tablespoon olive oil \[Around 800 calories\]
* Lunch and dinner: I entertain clients for a living and many meetings are over meals. Its difficult to track my calories, but I try to ensure I hit my protein goal of 150g a day
* Supper: I usually force myself to eat a small supper. Usually instant noodles and a can of tuna
* Supplements: 3g creatine a day
* Alcohol: This is a big struggle for me. I think about 4-6 shots of whisky a night (its a habit)

Based on my tracking, I gained about 27lb in the first 7 months (this was not a good idea, and I definitely gained more fat than I should have), and about 9lb in the other 6 months. My weight gain has slowed considerably and it has been a struggle to force myself to eat (see reason below)

**Exercise**

I started about with reddit's 6-day PPL at my apartment gym which doesn't have a barbell. This meant that I couldn't do the main compound lifts at all. Being as weak as I was, this worked for about 8 months until I thought that I \*really\* needed to find a real gym with a barbell. I then joined a gym and started on 5/3/1 BBB. My current 1RM (calculated, not tested) are:

Bench: 205lb

Military press: 135lb

Deadlift: 270lb

Squat: 200lb (I am terrible at squatting)

My accessories are simple: Chinups (bodyweight or weighted; 5x3x15kg or 5x5x10kg) superset with the BBB sets, 3x12 seated machine rows, 3x12 cable crossovers, 5x5 bench press, 3x15  facepulls, 3x25 hammer curls and 3x15 sets leg raises/ab wheel.

Conditioning: 2 days of light conditioning at the elliptical, 30 mins @ 130-140 bpm

**Progress**

All my family members and friends have told me that I look much better. Looking at my old photos, I am shocked at how skinny I was. I know my family really loves me because they really never cared how I looked lol. I even get compliments from some colleagues that I'm busting out of my work shirts (I need to tailor new shirts). It has been a great confidence boost and I know I'm on the right track.

**Questions**

At 6', 168 lb still feels skinny for me. (My target weight is around 185 lb) I can still see a bit of my collar bones and rib cage sticking out. I feel that my pecs are developing well (my wife tells me they are nice and hard). But I can't help but feel terrible that I'm developing a belly. From a side profile, my pecs and belly are about level. As a person who has identified with being skinny all my life, having a big belly weighs on my mind all the time. My question: Do I cut for a spell and get that belly down before bulking again; or do I continue to bulk given that I'm still small? Or is this all in my head? What bodyfat% am I at?

A big thanks to everyone in this sub, I've learnt so much and will definitely keep going.

EDIT: Thanks for the candid feedback everyone. The consensus is that cutting alcohol intake would be the best next course of action. Will work on for the 6 months and see how things go from there.

,Fitness,"Hey, ive had a question recently thats been bugging me lately. We all know the equation calories in/calories out (eat at a calorie deficit to lose weight, or a calorie surplus to gain weight) but what if i go into the negative calories burned? This may seem like a stupid question for some of you people but please bare with me lol. If i wake up and have a breakfast containing 800 calories, but then go to the gym right after and burn 900 calories that will leave me with -100 calories. Is this a bad thing? (Sorry if this was worded weirdly and is confusing)


I was also wondering which time of day to go to the gym is better. 

Hypothetically speaking, if someone needed 2000 calories to maintain their weight, but that person has decided to give themselves a calorie deficit of 500, should they get all of their meals out of the way first, making sure they reach that 2000 calorie body weight maintenance quota, and then go to the gym and burn 500 calories? Lets say i wake up and have an 800 calorie breakfast and burn whatever amount of calories at the gym (for this example lets say 700 leaving me with 100 calories left in the bank). Should i eat 1400 calories throughout the day to reach a maximum of 1500 calories? (because in this scenario i have a body maintenance need of 2000 calories per day and want to create a deficit)


In other words: should i get all of my meals out of the way and create a calorie deficit by working out? Does it matter if i wake up, have breakfast, go to the gym and eat back my calories spent to reach a total of 1500 calories?

,Fitness," So recently I've been noticing that I can hit my macro goals while being way under on kcals according to Cronometer. I'm going to focus specifically on the macro targets for now because the research I've done it isn't possible to be below on calories if I meet my macros and is telling me to base the calories off of that (i.e. 4p/4c/9f). I'm a little bummed though because I tried to be as accurate as possible by searching for the right brands and even weigh/measure a lot of items like fruits, veggies, condiments and meat.

I'm worried though that the items I'm finding in my searches aren't accurate or that if I do something like select a 2tbsp serving and enter the serving amount as 0.5 it is screwing up the calculator. So I have two questions. 1.) Is there a proven accurate/reliable food tracker app or 2.) anywhere I can find a source of absolute truth on macro content of a given item?

,Fitness,"So let’s say I’m working my chest. I have a good program that I follow and each full workout consisted of 6 sets lasts a certain time of minutes. It isn’t long but quite hard and asks a 100% effort, at least for me it’s like that. 

I like that cause I prefer more extreme but shorter portioned workouts. 

So I complete it once with great form but want to do it twice to get that extra pump and just go hard since I do a 5 day split and it seems like a good idea to go a bit harder than I would have if I worked on it more times a week. 

The problem is, on the second time I go, I already star failing at the first reps and even if I push through, my chest gives out and I do these weird, heavy shoulder assisted push ups which don’t really work but just mess up my shoulder day. 

My question is, does this mean that the workout is effective to be done only once and I should wait and not do it twice until my chest has developed well enough to take it on twice on the same day? 

Of course, I could wait 20 mins to recover and then do it again pretty decently. But if I had that much time, I’d do an easier workout but for 50mins instead.

[1st Dunk - Slo-Mo](https://imgur.com/a/dlMaDYy)


For 3-4 years I’ve been involved in strength training and been playing basketball since I was 14 (28 now). However just recently I started training my vertical jump (3 weeks).

I’ve always been able to touch rim but just threw  down for the first time last night. I know it wasn’t anything special, but it felt so awesome.. and I know the form isn’t perfect and the ball left my hands a bit early on the way down.

But what do you guys think! Any tips/pointers on dunk/jump technique? I’ve got the plyometric training down so that will help my vertical for sure.. I need to work on being more explosive because the strength is there.

For the first time in my life, I've been consistently hitting the gym/weights. I'd say it's been like that for the past 4-5 months. I mostly do full body workouts mixed in with some heavy weight lifts and some Hiit. 

The bad news is that I'm going back home for the holidays. Why is that bad? Because there isn't a gym nearby and I'll be there for two weeks. 

We are about 5 minutes away from some really nice trail running trails however, so I was thinking of hitting those decently hard for these two weeks and do some longer runs. Maybe something like 2-3 five mile runs each week mixed in with some abs. 

I was wondering if this would be a good alternative, or should I do something else, like some hill sprints or something? Should I do more or less miles, and how much more protein should I be eating to prevent muscle loss? Any other misc. advice or ideas?

1. My good friend won’t lift weights because he claims, “he wants to have joints in his 80s.”  Is lifting with proper form bad for joint health? I have very good squat form and do get sore knees, but maybe the soreness is due to something else? Any studies or science behind your answer would be huge. I have found conflicting reports and would love to learn more for myself and be able to explain it to my friend. 

2. TLDR: I took a month off from the gym and ate at maintenance. Got back in the gym and went from 60lb dumbbell bench to 75 lb dumbbell bench. All of my other lifts increased significantly as well. Any explanation?

I’ve lost 40 pounds still have another 40 to go to get back to my ideal physique that I once had. That said, I had not lifted for 2 years before starting up again and lifted sporadically for three month periods when I did lift. I probably hadn’t lifted seriously for more than 5 months at a time for 5 years. So I started lifting in late September through October. For example, I started benching the 50lb dumbbells and got up to the 60 lb dumbbells before taking all of November off. I didn’t lose weight or gain weight in November. I am at a 1500 caloric deficit and still maintaining these gains going into week three. The weird thing is, for example, I never lifted more than 100 lb dumbbells for bench, so I am significantly on my way to getting back there. Does anyone have any explanation for why I was able to gain on my lifts like this? I have looked online and can’t find anything conclusive... did I also gain muscle mass during my time away too?

I'm planning to start 5/3/1 - BBB soon and I have a question about programming. My apologies if this has been asked before but I couldn't find it in the search. I have read the two links in the Wiki that point to 5/3/1-BBB but I have not read the book, plan to soon.

My question is: Do I need to 5/3/1 sets and then 5x5 sets of the main AND then 5x10 of the second lift?

Background:

Winter 2017 I started to work out. It never really got too serious though, since I had no real drive, and the trainer at my school wasn't good. I stopped once track season started, and I didn't care too much.

That spring, in April 2018, I had what started the most difficult life experience to date. My first girlfriend, who I had been with for 11 months dumped me. I don't need to go in much detail, but it was shitty as hell, and I ended up dropping a few pounds, going to 125lbs.

I was filled with sadness, insecurity, and anger. One of my closest friends, who happens to know his stuff about working out, wanted to be my personal trainer. He wants to pursue a future as one, and I trusted him, so I obliged.

This was in July. I hadn't started eating right at this point, I was really just getting a routine down, and figuring out how to work out. No real progress was made, just figuring out my starting points for various exercises.

When I actually started:

In mid September 2018, I was ready. I started meal prepping and planning my meals. I'll never forget the first day I consumed 3,000 calories. I had never eaten so much in my life, I was constantly about to burst. It was honestly more difficult than working out, and I came incredibly close to throwing up that night.

Slowly, it became easier. I'd have days where I didn't meet the goal caloric intake, but I'd slowly make it more and more frequently.

After about a month I started to see some weight gain. I started to take creatine, and protein powder for protein shakes.

I continued eating as much as I could and consuming protein shakes after every workout, and I was making noticeable progress. I'd record my weight for different dates in a Google spreadsheet, and connect it to a chart and see a general upward trend. I made the goal of reaching 150lbs. Once I reached it, I'd buy myself a shirt and make a cutoff out of it.

I reached 150 in February 2019. Around late november 2018 to January 2019, I didnt make much progress. I got sick, attended my brother's graduation, got sick again. Really, I just wasn't able to work out for at least 2 weeks consistently during this time.

From Feb 2019 to June 2019, I went from 150 to 168 pounds. After making little progress from November 2018 -Jan 2019, I buckled down and went for it again. Made some good progress. 

June to July 2019, I started a cut. I wasn't really fat, but I figured I'd cut a bit off so I can have a good starting place for my next bulk. I did it for 4 weeks, and ended up taking a break from working out because I mentally exhausted myself. I decreased my volume with my caloric intake, but for some reason going to the gym really stressed me out. During my week long break, I concluded that I should go back to bulking up, because I wasn't really fat to start anyway. I wanted to just go all in and bulk until I was legitimately getting fat. Although, I will say I lost 4-5 lbs while I was cutting and a few lifts actually improved, so I'll consider it a minor success.

July to December 2019, I started my new bulking routine, and switched to my college gym (first semester). Went from 163 to 175 (current). July to late august, I worked out as frequently as I should have. Once I started college, however, it took a while until I started going consistently. I had to figure out how my daily schedule would work, how to get the calories in, etc. Mid october I started going consistently

Results, as of now:

Right now I think I look great. Im at my biggest, and I feel strong. I am getting a little fat, but I think I can continue bulking until the summer. After writing this, I'm going to the gym and starting a new routine.

&amp;#x200B;

Diet:

From Fall 2018 to Summer 2019, I'd wake up and eat a bowl of quaker banana nut oatmeal, cup of milk, banana, and package of belvita. I'd then get 3 lunches at school (none if I was meal prepping chicken and rice). After my workout, Id make a protein shake at home, then eat dinner (varied). Through the evening I'd drink more whole milk and eat belvita

Summer 2019, I'd still have the belvita oatmeal, banana and milk breakfast. Lunch would usually be a lean cuisine frozen meal, milk, belvita, and a banana. I'd workout around noon and go to work right after, where I'd have dinner (varied) and several cups of chocolate milk. When I got home at night, Id put some goya flavored rice in my rice cooker (great investment, highly recommend) and have a small protein shake.

Fall 2019 - December 2019, I'd eat approx 1200 calories at breakfast lunch and dinner at my college dining hall. I'd have 3 cups of while milk at every meal. Breakfast was usually 250 cal in eggs, 200 cal in yogurt, 450 cal in whole milk (It was rare for me to get 1200 cal for breakfast). Lunch and dinner varied a lot, but every friday I'd get a 32oz strawberry hulk with 2 servings of almond butter and 1 serving of protein at smoothie king. Id also get this if there was nothing good at the dining hall.

Lift progress:

(no belts)

Bench -  8x65lb -&gt; 8x150lb

Squat - 8x80lbs -&gt; 8x215lb

Chin ups - 5x127lb -&gt; 6x175lb

I'm starting a new program today (not included in the spreadsheet since I have only made the push day so far). Switching up the exercises while adding a bit more volume.

I plan on using this routine until summer 2020 where I plan to commit to a cut.

I  guess I'm just asking for advice on what I should do/ what might be the  best option for me that could be more sustainable? Has anyone faced  this same issue?

Thanks for the help.


Edit: Thank you to everyone who replied, I've gotten some good advice. First thing I'm going to try is caffeine or a creatine supplement before my next workout to see if that helps me feel more fueled. If not then I will try upping my carbs and eating an hour or so prior to going to the gym. If I'm still feeling drained then I will up my calories by a couple hundred. I won't stop lifting, thanks everyone!

Edit #2: I’ve woken up to some great advice, thanks again everyone for commenting. 

Some more information. I’m 26, and the workout I’m following at the moment is this, 


Day One
OHP Press – 5/3/1

Press – 5 sets of 10 reps

Lat work – 5 sets of 10 reps

Day Two
Deadlift – 5/3/1

Deadlift – 5 sets of 10 reps

Abs – 5 sets

Day Three
Bench Press – 5/3/1

Bench Press – 5 sets of 10 reps

Lat work – 5 sets of 10 reps

Day Four
Squat – 5/3/1

Squat – 5 sets of 10 reps

Abs – 5 sets

Some of you guys have mentioned I should take a break from cutting for a few weeks to a month and reverse diet to find my new maintenance. I will definitely look into it. 

Others have suggested I get my iron levels and d3 checked. As well as upping my carb intake and having more complex carbs rather than the mostly fruit I have been having. 

I didn’t think I was on too aggressive of a cut but a few people have mentioned it may be too high for my current height/weight.

&lt;p&gt;I  guess I&amp;#39;m just asking for advice on what I should do/ what might be the  best option for me that could be more sustainable? Has anyone faced  this same issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you to everyone who replied, I&amp;#39;ve gotten some good advice. First thing I&amp;#39;m going to try is caffeine or a creatine supplement before my next workout to see if that helps me feel more fueled. If not then I will try upping my carbs and eating an hour or so prior to going to the gym. If I&amp;#39;m still feeling drained then I will up my calories by a couple hundred. I won&amp;#39;t stop lifting, thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit #2: I’ve woken up to some great advice, thanks again everyone for commenting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more information. I’m 26, and the workout I’m following at the moment is this, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day One
OHP Press – 5/3/1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press – 5 sets of 10 reps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lat work – 5 sets of 10 reps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day Two
Deadlift – 5/3/1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadlift – 5 sets of 10 reps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abs – 5 sets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day Three
Bench Press – 5/3/1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bench Press – 5 sets of 10 reps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lat work – 5 sets of 10 reps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day Four
Squat – 5/3/1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squat – 5 sets of 10 reps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abs – 5 sets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you guys have mentioned I should take a break from cutting for a few weeks to a month and reverse diet to find my new maintenance. I will definitely look into it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others have suggested I get my iron levels and d3 checked. As well as upping my carb intake and having more complex carbs rather than the mostly fruit I have been having. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think I was on too aggressive of a cut but a few people have mentioned it may be too high for my current height/weight. I’ll take a short break from cutting and when I get back to it, will look into losing only 0.5lb per week.&lt;/p&gt;

What's the point of having people guess your body fat?

Nevermind that it&amp;#39;s the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - &lt;a href=""http://paindatabase.com/body-fat/""&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;) you&amp;#39;re still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: It's been such a weird decade for me in terms of fitness. In 2010 I was 153kg (337lbs) and was unable to walk 500m without being puffed, and just five years later I was 90kg (198lbs(  and able to run 3km in 12 minutes. However, within the next three years, I fell back into my old habits which would cause my weight to skyrocket back up to 133kg. Honestly, this was due to a whole lot of laziness and just way too much pizza. However,  in December last year, I decided that enough was enough. I started cutting the toxic food out of my life and begun to exercise again. 

What I did: I began walking pretty much every day. I would walk up to 15km some days, with a minimum of 10km on the others. I also started playing social basketball once a week again. Eventually, I built up the courage to start running again around December of last year. To be honest, although I was exercising a lot it wasn't until July of this year where things really started to pick-up. I joined the gym and decided that for the first time in my life I was going to seriously attempt weightlifting. In the past, I had dabbled with it, but I had never consistently gone or attempted to improve. This was a massive reality check for me. I never knew how weak I was. I mean, imagine being 125kg and barely able to bench the barbell. I started going 3x a week doing a full-body split. I became addicted to the gym super quick and realized that 3x a week was not going to be enough for me to be fulfilled. Therefore, I started doing a PPLPPL split. 

&amp;#x200B;

Weightlifting:

To give you an idea of how my lifts have improved:

BP  

July - 1RM - 30kg (66lbs)

Now - 1RM - 75kg  (165lbs)


DL  

July - 1RM - 60kg  

Now - Something around 120kg probs - I'll try it today.

  
OHP

July - 1RM - 20kg (45lbs)

Now - 1RM - 45kg (90lbs)

&amp;#x200B;

(I've only just started squatting yesterday - I had to get a PT to help me with form because I have terrible ankle flexability due to basketball injuries) 

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/125fwwCUj8jvMH5cPXGqGDIVL-ohNQQaH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/125fwwCUj8jvMH5cPXGqGDIVL-ohNQQaH/view?usp=sharing) \- here's my workout. It's worth mentioning that on the second pull day I substitute an exercise for DL which is 10x1 @ 50kg 10x1@80kg 5x2@100kg 3x3@110kg. On the second push day, I substitute an exercise for dips/lateral raises. 

These are my future goals:

  
\- 100kg (225lbs) Bench  
\- 60kg (132lbs) OHP  
\-150kg (330lbs) Squat  
\-180kg (390lbs) DL (Currently at 110 (242lbs) kgx3)  
\-More generally muscular appearance, but not super crazy.  
\-Lose 15kg

I'd take any feedback you have to give regarding my workouts so that I can achieve these goals. I also want to add core somewhere because I know it's important I just haven't done it yet.

Cardio:

I will run at least three times a week at a mid-high intensity, and I test my (theoretical) Vo2 max every two or three weeks by the 12 min run on a treadmill. I will also cycle on the exercise bikes every couple of days. I also play social basketball two times a week now (although both seasons have just finished and will start up soon),

Goals: 

Sub 5-minute kilometer 

Long term goals:

3km 12 minute run. 

Diet:

I don't count calories and macros that religiously. I know this is probably frowned upon - but I've tried using MyFitnessPal - and I kinda just forget. However, I try to stick under 2300 calories (I obviously also try to have a high protein intake so that I can somewhat lose fat and gain muscle - it's worked so far). I don't take protein powders or any pre-workouts aside from Creatine and I've only been doing that for a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion - I hope that I can achieve my goals and live healthier for the next decade. I'm not getting any younger so it's important that I stay healthy and achieve these goals while I can.",t2_4telwqi6,False,,0,False,M/23/192cm/135kg - M/24/192cm/112kg,[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_ea00s8,False,dark,,public,579,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,579,,False,,1576222304.0,,[],{},,True,,1576245317.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit - M/23/6&amp;#39;2/297lbs to M/24/6&amp;#39;2/246lbs &lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"I work with a personal trainer who makes me laugh at the crazy shit he comes up for me to do. Here's the difference between how I might have worked out before him, and how he makes me work:

Me: Knee pushups, 3 sets of 20 (I weigh 330 pounds), then 2 sets of regular pushups, I can do maybe 12 and then 10.

Him: Put on a *weight vest*, superset another exercise with pushups, and *never* resort to knee pushups, even when I'm reduced to looking like a spastic trying to get one more 1/4 of a pushup out as he yells ""explode!"" at me. 

Me: Do a typical barbell squat routine: Warmup set, 1 set of 12 , 1 set of 8, 3 sets of 5, increasing weight. Minute rest in between each set.

Him: Barbell squats with a pause mid-squat, up and down. Only 15 seconds rest between sets, and go for 20reps. If you just can't do 20, rack the bar, but pick it up and get those remaining reps out ASAP, no matter what.

Me: Planks, 3 sets, one minute.

Him: Planks are way too easy. Try this version of the plank you can only do for 3 seconds at the time, but keep trying to get back into it.

Me: 20 minutes on the treadmill, fast walk, alternating 90sec 8-degree incline with 90sec no incline, then a sprint at the end for however long I can.

Him: Put the treadmill at sprint, *max* incline, 20 second bursts, jumping on and off, as little rest in between bursts as possible. I did mention I weigh 330 pounds, so this 100% output for me, and I can't do it for very long.

I do 3 leg days a fortnight (combining squats and deadlifts on the same days), while I do 5 chest/shoulders days in that time period and 3 back/arm days.

Is combining squat/deadlift on the same day hurting my numbers? Or should I not worry about this and keep pushing with what I have.

ROUTINE:

1 hour per gym session approximately. Legs = Legs + core, Chest = chest + shoulders or triceps , Back = Back + biceps

Rough routine for each day is similar. 

For chest I do 3 x 6 bench, then 2 sets to failure. then I do the same for incline at a lower weight, then I do overhead press, delt fly, then lat raises, front lat raises then I'm done. On tricep days I still do delt fly but I do tricep extensions instead of the other exercises and I do 7 sets for each bench type instead, the last 2 sets at a lower weight.

For legs i do 3 x 8 for squats, then 2 x 6, then 1 to failure. Then I do 4 x 6 for leg presses, and then 1 to failure. Then I do 5 sets of 5 reps for deadlifts, and 1 set to failure. Lastly I then do 3 sets of hanging leg raises, 2 sets of sit ups on an incline, then 2 more sets of hanging leg raises, and 1 set of situps to failure. 

For back I first do pullups to failure. Then I do 6 sets of lat pulldowns, 3 sets wide grip 3 sets narrow grip, alternating. Then I do the horizontal pull thingy for 5 sets.  Then I do 5 sets of rear delt fly, then I switch the lat pulldown grip to the horizontal pull thingy grip and do that for 4 sets. Then I sometimes do 4 sets of barbell rows for 8 reps and 1 to failure. Usually I spend more time on isolation bicep exercises, starting with barbell curls alternating to hammer curls with dumbbells, 2 sets of wide grip curls, 2 sets of narrow grip, and 4 hammer curl sets.

,Fitness,"I've been having some trouble breathing in the front squat, and I don't know if it's because my technique is off or my belt is too tight. On my heaviest sets I try to inhale deeply (swelling my belly out, not my chest) just before I unrack the bar. By the time I step back to start squatting I need more air. If I exhale and breathe again I immediately lose stability, and if I try to soldier through and hold my breath through the first rep I sometimes get dizzy, which is obviously dangerous.

I'm not sure if my belt is too tight to get a proper lungful of air before I begin, or if I missed some important breathing lesson back when I was learning to lift. Any suggestions?

,Fitness,"Recently I've been putting more effort into prioritizing my health and building a healthier lifestyle, which naturally includes working out and fitness. Ever since I started college there would be periods of time during which I would go to the gym more frequently (i.e. winter break and summer), but it would be maybe 1-2x per week max and I'd be very inconsistent with the exercises I was doing and effort that I put in. Winter break recently began again and I have made it a goal of mine to stay consistent this time around. For the past couple of weeks I've been doing just that: going to the gym 4-5x a week and doing the same workout routines. However, I am now getting to a point where I'm trying to maximize efficiency and optimize my workouts.

Every workout consists of an hour of cardio (I experimented with a few methods, but settled on the elliptical) during which I usually go anywhere from 5-6.5 miles. Another hour is dedicated to resistance/weight training. I'm very much a noob in this aspect, so I pretty much do full-body workouts every time. I basically do all the workout machines in my gym, including: hip abductor/adductor, leg press, chest press, row, chest fly, lat pulldown, incline press, bicep curl, tricep extension, abdominal/crunch, and back extension. I try to mix up muscle groups so that I don't do all the machines that train the same ones in a row for ex. chest press then hip abductor rather than chest press then fly (not sure if this is actually beneficial). Set/rep range per machine is 2x\~13. I usually don't go to failure, but 13 reps is my max for good form. As an aside, I started off by doing cardio at first but found that it severely limited my resistance training ability. When I started doing weights first I realized I could do better and still have plenty of energy for cardio during the second hour.

As this is the first time I'm actually being consistent with working out, I'm seeing pretty significant gains. My body is becoming more defined, especially around my shoulders and arms. However, I know that this type of progress is likely not sustainable as time goes on and that I will eventually have to know what the hell I'm doing in the gym, lol.

Lastly, I've been looking into the wiki/researching into efficient ways for beginners to work out and it seems that the prevailing notion is that anything that gets beginners in the gym on a consistent basis is good enough. Now that I have that down, however, what are my next steps? My main goal is weight loss, so should I put the brakes on resistance training now until I reach my goal weight? Per the wiki, it says to choose one or the other. If I weren't to give up weight training, should I move to a more efficient/sustainable program, such as PPL? I've only really stuck to machines, so it would be a completely new experience for me to work with barbells/Smith machines/etc. If I did this, would I still have room for cardio and have my main goal still be weight loss?

,Fitness,"Hello,

Not a native speaker, I apologize for any mistakes. 
I’m a 5’3 woman, working out with weights and resistance bands + incorporating yoga for mobility. I’ve been doing this regularly for 3-4 months now and my body changed drastically. I was not overweight, but I definitely had no muscle composition whatsoever. 

When I first started I weighed 53 kg (117 lbs). I found a scale yesterday the curiosity got the best of me and I saw the number 55.8 (123 lbs). Now _I KNOW_ I put a serious amount of beginners muscle in a short time, but I never actually tracked my weight throughout the process. I will continue to build until I am at a certain body fat percentage (Goal is 17-18%). I have no fear of adding resistance and weight.

Here is my concern: I really don’t know if any point of this process the number of the scale will matter. I don’t care that it raised, but I don’t know what to expect in the future. I am trying to build lean muscle, eating carefully, building my calories back up (used to under eat due to busy schedule).

Going, straight to the point even if I don't know if it is the right subreddit, sorry for that.

Im 24, started lifting like 7 months ago and would like to know if I could compete in natural bodybuilding (men's physique but because of my natural shape probably men's classique) with a year of preparation. Is there an optimal age to start this type of fitness journey ? I feel like Im too old to start competing when I see people who are lifting since 16 years old.

Im 5'8 and went from 154,3 lbs to 190,2 lbs in those 7 months and I must be around 22% fat according to my electronic thingy.

My goal for my bulk is to reach 200 lbs and start cutting for a competition. But I wondered if muscles that worked for just one year and half could compete against muscles that had been trained for years.

,Fitness,"Hi 

So I have been following the Wendler 5/3/1 BBB program for a few months now and I decided to recently do cardio in the form of cycling for 30min in the mornings and then do weights in the afternoon. This is my third week training twice day. The first week I felt fine after implementing twice a day but last week I started to feel super tired and sluggish. I wasn't sleeping very well and my body (mostly legs) where sore every morning. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is can the introduction of cardio in the morning mess up my recovery so bad? Because I just came back from my 3 rest days and I am feeling great. But I know by Wednesday I will be feeling like crap.  I was under the impression cardio isn't that strenuous. I have tried to increase my caloric intake but according to my scale in the  mornings I am picking up weight way to fast for my liking. I included my BBB routine and diet below and by the looks of it doesn't look like I am doing to much volume. And IMO I think I should do more.   


**Cardio Routine in the morning:**  
30min on Bike moderate-high intensity  


**5/3/1 BB Routine 4 Days a week**

5x10 BBB sets (Bench, Squat, OHP, DL)

Incline Dumbbell Press 4x10

Bicep Curls 3x10

200g Potatoes/ Sweet Potatoes

A lot of veggies (broccoli, tomatoes, carrots)

**Supper**

5 whole eggs

70g of Rolled Oats

That's mostly what I eat day to day.

,Fitness,"Greetings all

I bought a basic rowing machine last year but didn't get very far with it.  I tried doing ten minute work outs figuring I'd increase the time as my endurance increased but basically quit because my endurance didn't go anywhere.  So, about seven weeks ago I realized that I wouldn't build endurance without, you know, enduring something, so I came up with a new plan.  Row for 30 minutes every Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, focusing on form and technique, and doing enough reps to keep my heart up and sweat going.  So I go strong as I feel comfortable backing off to lower intensity until I feel my breath coming easier and going back up.  Doesn't matter if I can only do two strokes a minute I figure I just need to keep going.  Turns out I can average between fifteen to twenty a minute, which I don't think is bad for a flabby out of shape bag of protoplasm in his early midlife.  Once I really have this down I plan to look into more regimented training plans but for right now I know I can stick with something as long as it's simple.

I stuck for it for a week solid, then sprained my ankle on some uneven concrete (which wasn't part of my plan) and took the next three weeks off to heal.  I've been at it for the last three weeks solid and I have to say I love the results.  I have actual mass and definition in my arms, I can walk up a flight of stairs without feeling like I'm going to pass out and my wife says I'm looking slimmer and have a more solid back.  I'm even standing taller and just all around feeling better.  I had to bring in some heavy packages last week and was amazed at how much easier it was.  Damn I love the rowing machine.  If I can make this much progress after a month of training I'm excited to see where I can be in six months or a year.  My only regret is that I didn't start doing this twenty years ago.

Anyway, what I'm wondering is if I should just keep going week after weak or if that will start to be a negative.

,Fitness,"(Earlier post was removed, but honestly, I can't find a past thread that discusses the details I'm hoping to learn about...)

I've been using a heart rate tracking watch for the last year. While cutting this past summer, my overnight BPM averaged 42-45 bpm. Since bulking \~2 weeks ago, this has increased to 55-57bpm.

What do you all make of sleep quality changes when bulking? Some factors I wonder about maybe contributing to this:  


\-Increased eating before bed (more digestion during sleep)

\-Anabolic state means more time spent growing muscle, which maybe is somehow costlier on my metabolism?  


&amp;#x200B;

Maybe none of this really matters. I feel as if I could be more well rested than I am, but not incredibly so.

&lt;p&gt;What do you all make of sleep quality changes when bulking? Some factors I wonder about maybe contributing to this:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Increased eating before bed (more digestion during sleep)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Anabolic state means more time spent growing muscle, which maybe is somehow costlier on my metabolism?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe none of this really matters. I feel as if I could be more well rested than I am, but not incredibly so.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious to hear your thoughts on food timing, bulking, resting and sleeping heart rates, and overall sleep quality while bulking vs cutting/maintenance...&lt;/p&gt;

Hi,

I started doing thefitness.wiki beginner [routine](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/) a few months ago. When I do barbell rows, I find it hard to keep my elbows tucked into my sides because it forces me to twist my wrists, which in turn causes me to lift entirely with my arms and (at least it feels like) not engage my lats at all. I've found through experimentation that if I deload a lot or use dumbells instead (because I can twist wrist so my grip runs front to back instead of left to right), it helps engage my lats. For reference, I'm currently rowing 50 kg (110 lbs) and benching 40 kg (88 lbs). I've read or heard (thought it was on the guide but I don't see it there now so I'm not sure which) that benches and rows are complementary exercises. Does this mean they should be approximately the same load? Therefore, should I

* Switch to dumbell rows?

* Deload to my bench weight or less and try to fix my form with the barbell?

* Something else entirely?

Total 4 month progression seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/4i3Aqxe)

TLDR: Wanted a change and managed to lose weight and add well over 100lbs to a couple of my big lifts and did it by holding progressive overload as the most vital aspect of training while trying to safely lift as heavy as i could....also lost well over 10lbs of fat in the process.

Let's start off with a big THANK YOU to those of you who provide information and discussion in this community. I'm by no means an expert...a lot of which would be clear with a surface level analysis of my routine....and seeing the conversations here has helped me find a way...so I'm posting this with the hope I can help at least one person. (by directing them to the recommended routines lol)

**Physical background:** I'm a 36 year old former athlete with arthritis and the lasting impact of 2 reconstructive knee surgeries and a lifetime of basketball. I'm 6'0'' and at the start of this whole thing I weighed 212 lbs

These were my numbers to start with back in August when I looked like the before picture above

Squat: 260

Bench:270

Deadlift:225

OHP:155

So, on August 1 I set out to lose some weight first and foremost as 217 was just killing me....CICO was the method using MyFitnessPal and my Apple Watch and the workouts were like this....this is all basically cardio tbh so skip down to the second month if you're about that REAL [r/fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/) action

August 1st: P90X CHEST AND BACK (workout available online)

2nd: 40 min Cardio on Bike

3rd: P90X shoulders and arms

4th: 40 min Cardio Eliptical

5th: P90X Legs and Back

6th: REST DAY

7th: 40 min cardio

Then i'd repeat that weekly stretch through the end of the month...I'd done many rounds of P90X in my past and knew the workouts (as well as their shortcomings) and how they have impacted my body. Was able to get down to a weight of 198 lbs when I went for my first DEXA scan.

[Scan and picture](https://imgur.com/a/8x8WgBz)

Numbers: 17.2 % Body Fat at 198 LBS with 34 lbs of fat tissue and 154.7 lbs of lean tissue

So there I was, down to 198 and looking to continue to lose fat down to a goal of 15% while also getting some muscle. So here was the plan

**MONTH 2 and Beyond**

**Diet:** I was dead set on gaining muscle and losing fat so there would need to be some changes beyond CICO (I believed)

I was going to stay around 200-300 calories over maintenance level including exercise so with my workout plan that came to about 2900 or so calories a day with about 190 G of protein a day...i TRIED to limit carbs at first but my numbers stalled in the gym. So i wound up getting about 35% of my calories from carbs 30% from fat and 25% from Protein

My supplements were 5g of Creatine Monohydrate and 10g of Raw milled Flaxseeds a day (in cereal, because carbs baby) and a multivitamin

**Workouts:**

What I wound up settling on after reading all of the recommended workouts and routines was a modified version of GZCL...3 workouts a week and spaced to allow me to handle work and childcare...because it was only 3 days i would have some marathon sessions lasting well past 1.5 hours (which was long for me but now i've adjusted to it) Progressive overload and making sure to increase volume was a priority so the STRONG app on IOS came through in that regard.

The two workouts featured an 8 min warmup on the treadmil at 6mph

**Lower:**

Squat: 5 sets of 1-3 at 85% Max

Deadlift: 5 sets of 1-3 at 85% Max

Let Press: 5 Sets of 1-3 at 85% Max

Bulgarian Split Squat: 3x10

Lunges: 3x10

Calf raises: 3x10

Weighted Crunches: 3x10

Weighted Leg Raises 3x10

Weighted Russian Twists 3X10

Loaded Carry: 400 Feet

**Upper**

Bench Press:5 sets 1-3 at 85%

OHP: 5 sets at 1-3 at 85%

Weighted Pull Ups: 5 Sets 1-3 at 85% max ( i love pull ups)

Weighted Dips 3x10

Iso Row 3x10

Weighted Crunches: 3x10

Weighted Leg Raises 3x10

Weighted Russian Twists 3X10

I would alternate these workouts with off days....sometimes three times a week....sometimes if i could sneak an extra day in I would. I just wanted to have a base goal of getting in there and kicking ass at the very least three times a week.

You can see my results and DEXA scans from about 2.5 months later [Here](https://imgur.com/a/uSlyFbF)

Current Numbers

13.2% Bodyfat at 195 LBS 25 lbs of fat tissue and 159.4 pounds of lean tissue.

**I'D MANAGED TO GAIN 5LBS OF MUSCLE WHILE LOSING 10 LBS OF FAT**

was this the result of powerlifting newbie gains? I've got no idea...but whatever I did my body really responded well to it...so i'm going to keep doing this. My current max numbers are

Bench:305

Squat:375

Deadlift:415

OHP: 165 (shoulder pain...idk what that's all about but i'm working through it)

Pull-ups: 12 with 65lbs added

Not sure what the shoulder thing is but it's only really a limitation when i do OHP or max bench...it's been around for a few years now.

That's it! my little journey into powerlifting was good for me. if you're interested please please ask me anything that comes to mind....or correct mistakes that i've made! as if not for this community none of it would have been possible.",t2_nmlwi,False,,0,False,120 Days of Progress DEXA Scans included.

,Fitness," Hi all,

Due to a range of injuries over the past few years I have recently decided to put an emphasis on varying my exercises to improve my strength in different ROM's/positions and work on muscles normally neglected. I come from a PL background (200/145/245kg or 440/320/540 @ 83kg/183lbs) and have imbalances due to focusing mostly on the big 3.

Recently I have implemented a lot more deficit and snatch pulls (Increase ROM/stretch hamstrings and use lower weight with the same fatigue levels) and single arm dumbell presses (stability), along with a lot more direct hamstring and spine flexion work (on a 45 degree back extender, flexing and arching my back). I am looking for more odd lifts that will improve overall mobility and full body strength in a ***commercial*** gym, having dumbells only up to 50kg/110lbs and normal straight barbells only.

Any recommendations welcome! I am thinking things that involve twisting or side bending (like a suitcase deadlift) and ROM's not usually seen in PL, exercises with large ROM's too.

,Fitness,"For the past two months I have been eating a 20g whey protein bar before my morning workout along with a 21g vegan protein shake afterward. 

I recently read that it is optimal to have whey protein after a workout since it digests fast and then casein before bed because it is a long digesting protein. However, the caseins I have tried make me want to throw up every time I try to drink them. 

Since my vegan protein is pea based (which I have heard is slow digesting), can I take the whey after my workout and vegan protein before bed to get similar results?

,Fitness,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I started doing the 5/3/1 for beginners in april for 2 months, had a 3 months summer break, and continued from sepetember to middle of november. I had already been lifting prior to that, but mainly ""bro programs"" (for exemple only doing curls and no leg days).

I am 18M, 1.78m tall and ate around 3000 kcal per day and about 150g of protein per day, tracked on the myfitness app. My initial lifts were 95kg squat; 110kg deadlift; 70kg bench press; 40kg OHP.

At the end, my lifts were 125kg squat; 140kg deadlift; 80kg bench press and 50kg OHP.

Yet the problem is even though this progress was very satisfying for me, my main goal was overall apparence rather than strenght and hitting certain numbers, and even though I gained 5 kg, there was no change in size in my apparence.

Start 72kg:  [https://imgur.com/a/O2uxCxi](https://imgur.com/a/O2uxCxi) 

End 77.5kg+:  [https://imgur.com/a/xAqAnI1](https://imgur.com/a/xAqAnI1) 

In my opinion, I just look a little more fat and don't look any better. The increase in strenght and lifts is nice, but not my primary goal, and the lack of physical progress has sucked out all my motivation. Knowing that I could gain another 5kg and have as little/none change like that takes out the aim of going to the gym for me.

How is it possible that I have good results in numbers but none in front of the mirror? Have I underestimated myself and the 5/3/1 is too ""beginer"" for me? Is it too strenght oriented and I should try a wiki program that focuses on building size? If so, which one? Most programs on the wiki say ""size and strenght"", just like for the 5/3/1.

I am not used to split my workouts for different parts of the body so I have to do some planing. I don&amp;#39;t think am going to have one day for arms, since I am probably going to use my arms on most days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is to do that week/workweek and then have one entire week for resting. I am also going to eat a lot more and try to sleep one more hour that week. What do you think about my plan, and is there something I should/shouldn&amp;#39;t do?&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"https://weightology.net/the-pitfalls-of-body-fat-measurement-part-1/

So before we get started, here’s a link to part one of the series. I highly recommend you read the whole thing, it's really good. 

So as a preface: All accuracy rates mentioned here are compared to what's called a four compartment model. This involves: 

- Measuring body density with underwater weighing, 

- Total body water with a technique called deuterium dillution, 
- And bone mineral content using DEXA scans. 

Equations are used to get the estimates for the four components (Fat, water, mineral, and protein) total. This is by far the most accurate estimate of all, but its not accessible for most people.

With that being said, here’s all of them


##Underwater Weighing:

- Weighs you in an underwater tank, measures how much water you displace. Fat floats and Fat Free Mass (FFM) tends to sink. They calculate body density from that and get bodyfat percentage.
- Good results when looking at group averages, poor results when looking at individuals. Not a good choice when trying to find out your personal bodyfat percentage and body composition changes.
- Sources of error include:
      1. Air left in lungs (which is often estimated)
      2. Having air bubbles in your hair
      3. Weight gain or loss over time (which can change FFM density)
      4. Hydration status
      5. The equations that convert body density into bodyfat percentage

- Error Margin for Individuals
    1. **Error rate up to 5-6%**
    2. **Even more prone to error when tracking body composition over time**

##Bod Pod:

- Similar principles to underwater weighing, but uses air displacement instead of water.

- Overall worse then underwater weighing.

- Sources of error:
       1. All of the above factors for underwater weighing (cept everything having to do with water, like bubbles in your hair)
       2. Facial hair
       3. Body temperature
       4. Moisture
       5. The tightness of the spandex or swimsuit used in the measurement process

- Error margin for individuals: 
     1. **Up to 15% (seriously)**
     2. **even worse for tracking changes over time.**



##Bioelectrical Impedance:

- Runs a light electrical current through your body. Due to the fact that FFM contains mostly water and fat contains very little water the FFM will have less resistance to this electrical current. Uses this to predict bodyfat %. 
- Convenient, but at the cost of accuracy.

- This includes any of those handheld devices that track bodyfat (like this) , or any of the scales that you step on that gives you your bodyfat percentage.

- If you keep a strict hydration schedule (same amount of water every day, drink and pee at same time per day, ect) average a scale and handheld device together, and wait a VERY long time between measurements so that a large changes is made then it can kinda sorta maybe be used….ish.

- Sources of error
    1. How prone you are to storing subcutaneous fat as opposed to visceral fat.
    2. Will miss entire sections of your body, handheld devices will miss your entire lower body, scales you step on will miss your entire upper body. (You can probably take a handheld device and a scale device and avarage the two together and get a slightly more accurate reading.)
    3. Will be completely thrown off by changes in hydration, this is one of the largest sources of error.
    4. Its often a prediction based off of a prediction, devices are made and tested in comparison to hydrostatic weighing (which is also bad for individuals).

- Error Margin for Individuals:
     1. **Up to 8%**
     2. **Also poor for tracking changes in body composition over time** (As a matter of fact, in one study using BMI to track body composition was more accurate for changes over time...yeah…)



##Skinfolds
- Skinfolds are measured by taking a device known as a caliper, pinching the skin and fat underneath the skin, pulling the skinfold away, and measuring the thickness of the skinfold with the caliper. 
- Usually done at numerous sites around the body. The thicknesses are added together and plugged into an equation that spits out your bodyfat percentage.
- Can be from 3-7 to more sites, the more places you pinch the more accurate it is.
- This is actually a good measurement for tracking changes in bodyfat over time IF you:
    1. Learn to do it properly, [here’s a good tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx7pHJomSTc)
    2. Don’t even bother calculating the bodyfat percentage, just take the caliper measurements and if its going down, you're losing fat.

- Sources of error:
     1. Skill of the person taking the readings (biggest by far)
     2. The equation you pop your skinfolds into
     3. Changes in bodyfat over time resulting in FFM density changes.

- Error margin for individuals:
    1. **Up to 10-15%**
    2. Not very good at measuring changes in body composition *if you use the equation to find a percentage.* 
    3. **Error rates of 3-5% for changes over time.**

##The almighty DEXA

- Once used to determine bone density, the DEXA scan works by measuring your body’s absorbance of x rays at two different energies. Tracks fat, bone mineral, and Fat Free Soft Tissue.

- Despite that people often take the DEXA scan as a holy grail of body composition measurement, its actually not that great. 

- Although admittedly better then our other options, I personally think its not worth the 100-200 dollars it costs to get one.

- Sources of Error: 
    1. Inconsistent results between different machines from both the same and different manufacturer(s). 
    2. Changes in software. 
    3. Changes in software/hardware configurations.
    4. The type of X ray beam
    5. Hydration status
    6. Ethnicity and body type

- Error Margin for individuals:
     1. **Anywhere from 4% to 8% to 10% depending which study you look at.**
     2. Not super great at tracking changes over time either, Individual error rate was as high as 4% over time.
     3. Seems to overestimate decreases in bodyfat, underestimates increases in body fat.
     4. Also seems to over estimate total bodyfat percentage as well (at least compared to most)

Personally, my favorite method is to use the mirror for the final estimation of bodyfat - However because most people underestimate their bodyfat, I use the [US Navy Method](http://fitness.bizcalcs.com/Calculator.asp?Calc=Body-Fat-Navy) and calipers to calculate my bodyfat only for the sake of keeping myself honest.

Discussion Questions:

- **Do you know how to track your bodyfat percentage?** 

- **If so, do you track your bodyfat percentage?**

- **If you do, how do you personally track your bodyfat percentage?**

- **Have you had good results with any of the above methods that were shat on in this series?**


And finally, if its your goal, good luck with your body composition changes.",t2_4loxi5rm,False,,0,False,"This is a great series by James Krieger on body-fat percentage measurement.

,Fitness,"[Beginner]

I've been regularly working out for 6 months. Seen impressive strength gains in some exercises (12 inverse Pull ups instead of 6 at the beginning), but in others I don't seem to make progress (Triceps isolation being the worst).

I always train more or less to failure with sets with reduced reps (e.g. 12-9-7) - as many as I can do maintaining decent form. But since I'm going to failure there is just no way to overload an exercise (more reps or heavier) if I don't get stronger.

Should I decrease load and purposefully not go to failure to be able to overload? If so, won't I run into the same problem some weeks later when I get closer to failure again? Is it bad to go to failure? A lot of guys seem to maintain reps for different sets, which means the sets get harder for you, right? It's kinda frustrating, since the main ""progress bar"" I use is load-gain, cause I'm too lazy to do size measurements and don't wanna do pics... Any help is appreciated!

,Fitness," **Back story:** Male, 24 years old, been lifting for almost 4 years, herniated my disc two years ago, got told to never squat/deadlift/Lift heavy overhead again. Through lots of stretching, Sports massage and carefully perfecting form before going heavy i have been able to do all and finally smashed through previous PR's during this program.

[Pics:](https://imgur.com/a/V7nA5DK) Shortly after back injury recovery and first session back / Start of BBB / End of BBB

(ive taken pictures every month since i started lifting again, i highly recommend doing it for comparisons)

**Body Stats and changes:**

Shortly after back injury recovery: 85kg 19% BF

Start of BBB: 81kg 14% BF

End of BBB: 85kg 17% BF

**Routine and why i changed it slightly:** The base of the routine i got from the 3 month BBB challenge listed on T-Nation before reading the books. When i didnt understand it fully i went back, got the books and adjusted accordingly. All 5 x 10 were done at 50% of 1RM the three weeks, 60% 1RM the second 3 weeks and 70% on the thrid three weeks. I Switched from a very high volume PPL so going down to what the book said to do felt like almost nothing, so i added quite a few extra accessories as my body could recover fine. I know alot of people will say ive added to many extra accessories and thats fine i felt like that on its own was not enough so i added more. I switch from back squat to a front squat and Leg press as i found back squating aggrevated my back so instead of being in pain/hurt my self more i switch it out for similar movements. I added some joker sets in during the second phase but was too tired during the last phase. So this was the final routine.

* **Mon:** Deadlift 5/3/1 - Leg press 5x10 - Glute bridges 3x10 - 2 x Ab variations x 15
* **Tues:** OHP 5/3/1 - Bench 5x10 - Wide lat pull down 3x10 - Close grip lat pulldown 3 x10 Dumbell one arm Tricep Ext 3 x 10 EZ Bar Curl 3 x 10
* **Weds:** Rest / Stretch routine
* **Thurs:** Front squat 5/3/1 - Deadlift 5x10 - Single leg extension 3 x 10 - Calve raise machine 3 x 10 2 x Ab variations x 15
* **Fri:** Bench 5/3/1 - OHP 5 x 10 - Seated cable row 3 x 10 - Face pulls 3 x 10 - Tricep pushdown 3 x 10 - Dumbell hammer curls 3 x 10

**Routine Summary:** The 5/3/1 combo was really good from switching from 5x5. It felt refreshing and the numbers moved each week so you never lifted the same weights always felt like it was improving. It reccomends in the book and on the challnege on the final AMRAP set to only do that number of reps, which i ignored and AMRAP as i always felt like i had more in the tank. The first three weeks of BBB accessories i thought 'this is way to easy'. 50% was too light and is too light but by the end of the 6th week i was missing them days. 60% for 10 reps is hard and by the end i was very tired but that does not compare to the 70% on the next few weeks. Rest time between sets went up from 60 seconds to 120 sometimes higher if needed. If you are just starting out on this program and feel like you need more, i understand, but get to week 6 and then see if you feel the same. Deload wise i skipped the first one as i felt good, after 6 weeks i took a week deload and went down to 50% of everything as is stated in the books.

**Pre / Post BBB 1RM:**

* Bench *81kg /* **94kg**
* OHP *46kg /* **53kg**
* Deadlift *128kg* / **147kg**
* Front squat *78kg* / **93kg**

**Eating:**

I'm currently in a bulking phase, i was when i started eating around 3000 cals but now up to 3300 to allow for my body getting used to the higher cals. I plan to bulk the whole of 2020 and get as big as possibly before doing a cut for summer 2021 which then ill maintain hopefully as ill be to a good size.

Macro split if anyone is intrested: *C:371g P:248g F:96g*

**What next:**

Next we go back to PPL. I want to get bigger in size overall and feel that PPL is better as a upper lower split (which is what this kinda is) is focused more towards strength over size. I plan on keeping the 5/3/1 for the main lifts and possibly so FSL if i feel strong enough. Please let me know if there is anything else you'd like me to add i found these kinds of in detail posts super helpful when i was trying to find a routine so hope this helps some of you.",t2_k1ajd,False,,0,False,5/3/1 BBB 3 Month Challenge - A review including progress pics and full routine,[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_e2hkvk,False,dark,,public,477,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,477,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1574897467.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back story:&lt;/strong&gt; Male, 24 years old, been lifting for almost 4 years, herniated my disc two years ago, got told to never squat/deadlift/Lift heavy overhead again.

The first three weeks of BBB accessories i thought &amp;#39;this is way to easy&amp;#39;. 50% was too light and is too light but by the end of the 6th week i was missing them days. 60% for 10 reps is hard and by the end i was very tired but that does not compare to the 70% on the next few weeks. Rest time between sets went up from 60 seconds to 120 sometimes higher if needed. If you are just starting out on this program and feel like you need more, i understand, but get to week 6 and then see if you feel the same. Deload wise i skipped the first one as i felt good, after 6 weeks i took a week deload and went down to 50% of everything as is stated in the books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre / Post BBB 1RM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bench &lt;em&gt;81kg /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;94kg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OHP &lt;em&gt;46kg /&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;53kg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlift &lt;em&gt;128kg&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;147kg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front squat &lt;em&gt;78kg&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;93kg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently in a bulking phase, i was when i started eating around 3000 cals but now up to 3300 to allow for my body getting used to the higher cals. I plan to bulk the whole of 2020 and get as big as possibly before doing a cut for summer 2021 which then ill maintain hopefully as ill be to a good size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macro split if anyone is intrested: &lt;em&gt;C:371g P:248g F:96g&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we go back to PPL. I want to get bigger in size overall and feel that PPL is better as a upper lower split (which is what this kinda is) is focused more towards strength over size. I plan on keeping the 5/3/1 for the main lifts and possibly so FSL if i feel strong enough. Please let me know if there is anything else you&amp;#39;d like me to add i found these kinds of in detail posts super helpful when i was trying to find a routine so hope this helps some of you.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been following the StrongLifts 5x5 program for 6 months now. I had never lifted before.

* Squat: 200lbs
* Bench: 120lbs
* Row: 120lbs

* DL: 220lbs

I am plateauing on all those lifts on 5x5. I can still increase my lifts if I only do 3x3 or 1x1 but I am stuck at those weights for 5x5. 

My idea is to stop this linear progression program like StrongLifts and start doing a program that's more evolved like 5/3/1 because it seems better for my situation and goals which is to increase my main lifts.

,Fitness,"Repost from r/powerlifting.

Hey everyone. After utilizing a cheap leather double-prong Harbinger belt for one year (and switching to velcro later for another year), I'm finally now taking the next step to get a competitive and high-quality belt for myself after I reached an intermediate level. Right now, my SBD maxes are 345/270/395 at 190 lbs, 5'3.5. Yeah, i'm heavy af for my height, but I am making sure that I will never reach 200, and hope to cut down over time.

I've been wanting an Inzer belt though for such a long time, but i'm really uncertain on whether I would want the 10mm or the 13mm. I know the two don't have much difference unless i'm really an elite lifter.

To sum up, I am considering the Inzer to be the last belt I would ever purchase and need for my lifting career. That being said, should I go for the 10mm since I'm short, not as advanced yet, and am planning to cut over time? Or should I go for the 13mm, since I am planning to keep this belt for the many years to come, and wear it still when hitting monster lifts?

Edit/Result: Just ordered a 10mm in Royal Blue this morning, thanks everyone for the advice!

,Fitness,"My wife has joined a challenge where they do 5 more squats everyday for a month. Is this considered overtraining?

Edit: First thanks to everyone who took the time to answer constructively; it's appreciated. After reading some responses, it seems that more explanation may be necessary.  I tried to keep the original post very short as it seems more attention is given to questions that don't require a TL;DR.

At the beginning, years and years ago, I first got into regular exercise by jumping on the P90X train. I did the program twice, back to back, in the evenings, while running every other day (~3 miles in the morning). I followed with P90X2, then the third, and ended up with a great habit and the loss of 100lbs.

Fast forward, my wife and I met, I got swept away in life (work, us, etc.), and I let the habit slip. We jumped back on the wagon together with P90X3, got in shape a bit and had a good time while doing it. Then she got pregnant and the story repeated itself. 

Now that the baby is here, it's time to 'stand back up'... so we decided to find a program to help jump start the process. She had been previously familiar with 21 Day fix, so I agreed to do it with her. The workout isn't bad, it's not high intensity, but it's a start, and it only takes 30 days to make (or break) a habit, so I couldn't see any harm. I break a sweat, we alternate the workouts so that I have the baby and she works out, then she takes the baby and I work out.

At the very beginning of this, she found a challenge group that adds bodyweight squats to the workout everyday (FB challenge). So after the first workout is over, do 5 body weight squats. Second day, second workout, ten squats. Third day, third workout, 15 squats. The pattern continues in this fashion. 

After doing similar programs before, as well as 12+ years martial arts (age 5 - 17), then directly to the USMC, I had heard many, many times that you should give every muscle a break to recover. It was drilled into us that the recovery is important for the growth of the muscle and when it doesn't occur it can produce undesirable, even negative, effects.  My first thought was this is going to be counter productive. After a quick Google search, I saw the word overtraining used in reference to this concept.

Before 1 rep maxes: Back squat: 170 Bench: 145 Overhead Press: 75 Deadlift: 225

After 1 rep maxes: Back Squat: 390 Bench: 325 Overhead Press: 205 Deadlift: 480

Here are the before pictures from my previous post: https://imgur.com/a/T9x4zKg, https://imgur.com/a/BzOLo7j
I know my leg lifts haven't really progressed that well due to injuries and hard work on my feet for my job getting in the way, but I'm still satisfied with my progress.


For my diet I typically eat eggs every morning with Greek yogurt and a protein shake. For lunch I usually eat lunch meat sandwiches of salami, pepperoni, and ham with carrots, grapes, a protein bar, cosmic brownies, water, and Greek yogurt for sides. For dinner I typically eat either chicken, steak or pork with milk, greek yogurt and veggies. 

I've kept up with mostly the same routine, but I've added significantly more bicep and tricep work since last year:

Day 1: 1 arm DB Rows 4 x 8 - 12, Lat Pull down (Or Pull-ups) 4 x 10-12, DB Curls 4 x 8 - 12, OH Tricep Ext (BB, Cable or DB) 4 x 12 - 15, Incline DB Bench 3 x 8-10, dips, reverse preacher curls, cable flies, Bench Press (nSuns), OHP (nSuns)

Day 2: Leg Extensions 4 x 10 - 12, Leg Curls 4 x 12-15, Glutes Cable Pull throughs (Optional) 4 x 12 - 15 , Hanging Leg Raises 3 x 20, Cable Crunches 3 x 10-12, BB Calf Raises 4 x 10 - 15, Squat, Sumo deadlift

Day 3: Facepulls 3 x 12-15 SS Hammer Curls (DB or Cable), Lateral raises 4 x 12-15, Cable Crossovers 4 x 12-15, Incline Bench, chin ups, various other bicep exercises (just depends what's open at my uni rec) OHP

Day 4: Seated Cable Rows 4 x 10-12, Lat Pull-downs (or pull-ups) 4 x 10 - 12, Hyperextension 2 x 12 - 15, Insert 1-2 Abs movements of your choice (Can be the same as last time. That was an example of two you could do...), BB Calf Raises 4 x 10-15, Deadlift, Front Squat

Day 5: Facepulls 4 x 15-20 SS Tricep Pull downs 4 x 10 - 12, Incline DB Curls or Preachers Curls 4 x 8 - 12, Lateral Raises 4 x 12 -15, DB Curls (Slow) 4 x 10 - 12, bicep work (depends on whats available at my uni rec) Bench, Close grip bench

&lt;p&gt;Before 1 rep maxes: Back squat: 170 Bench: 145 Overhead Press: 75 Deadlift: 225&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 1 rep maxes: Back Squat: 390 Bench: 325 Overhead Press: 205 Deadlift: 480&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my after photos: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/lXPRLrf""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/lXPRLrf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/EbzJWi6""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/EbzJWi6&lt;/a&gt;
Here are the before pictures from my previous post: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/T9x4zKg""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/T9x4zKg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/BzOLo7j""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/BzOLo7j&lt;/a&gt;
I know my leg lifts haven&amp;#39;t really progressed that well due to injuries and hard work on my feet for my job getting in the way, but I&amp;#39;m still satisfied with my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my diet I typically eat eggs every morning with Greek yogurt and a protein shake. For lunch I usually eat lunch meat sandwiches of salami, pepperoni, and ham with carrots, grapes, a protein bar, cosmic brownies, water, and Greek yogurt for sides. For dinner I typically eat either chicken, steak or pork with milk, greek yogurt and veggies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve kept up with mostly the same routine, but I&amp;#39;ve added significantly more bicep and tricep work since last year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1: 1 arm DB Rows 4 x 8 - 12, Lat Pull down (Or Pull-ups) 4 x 10-12, DB Curls 4 x 8 - 12, OH Tricep Ext (BB, Cable or DB) 4 x 12 - 15, Incline DB Bench 3 x 8-10, dips, reverse preacher curls, cable flies, Bench Press (nSuns), OHP (nSuns)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2: Leg Extensions 4 x 10 - 12, Leg Curls 4 x 12-15, Glutes Cable Pull throughs (Optional) 4 x 12 - 15 , Hanging Leg Raises 3 x 20, Cable Crunches 3 x 10-12, BB Calf Raises 4 x 10 - 15, Squat, Sumo deadlift&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 3: Facepulls 3 x 12-15 SS Hammer Curls (DB or Cable), Lateral raises 4 x 12-15, Cable Crossovers 4 x 12-15, Incline Bench, chin ups, various other bicep exercises (just depends what&amp;#39;s open at my uni rec) OHP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 4: Seated Cable Rows 4 x 10-12, Lat Pull-downs (or pull-ups) 4 x 10 - 12, Hyperextension 2 x 12 - 15, Insert 1-2 Abs movements of your choice (Can be the same as last time. That was an example of two you could do...), BB Calf Raises 4 x 10-15, Deadlift, Front Squat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 5: Facepulls 4 x 15-20 SS Tricep Pull downs 4 x 10 - 12, Incline DB Curls or Preachers Curls 4 x 8 - 12, Lateral Raises 4 x 12 -15, DB Curls (Slow) 4 x 10 - 12, bicep work (depends on whats available at my uni rec) Bench, Close grip bench&lt;/p&gt;

My immediate thought was that the statement is misleading as it doesn't actually state what it's more effective at, but I'll assume it's talking about calorie use as that seems to be the goal of the class (fitness orientated, pictures of young and middle-aged women, claims it burns ""up to 800 calories"" an hour).

Reading up online this statement is taken from a NASA study in 1980 but I can find very little about this other than news articles/""rebounding"" websites using the claim without any real citations. From what I have been able to find out, the study was only covering 8 young males and that the trampolines in the study were full size trampolines, not mini-trampolines with limited ""bounce"".

,Fitness,"I'm an experienced lifter, and I know the importance of all of the lifting/nutrition fundamentals. Set goals. Be consistent. Work smart. Lift with good form. Check your pride at the door.

A concept that has long eluded me is working hard in the gym.

Of course if we're talking about not skipping leg day, preparing adequately for workouts, and not just screwing around on your phone for 15 minutes between sets before calling it a day after a couple of exercises, then I fully understand it.

But in the middle of a set, *lifting hard* is a concept that I just don't get. It seems contradictory to the other advice because beyond a certain point, pushing hard in the middle of a set will almost necessarily cause form breakdowns. Let's say I'm doing Romanian Deadlifts, and it's a really tough set where I'm giving it my all with shaky legs and slipping grip. I could potentially pull out another couple of reps, but my form would likely break down as well, my back would likely round, and they wouldn't be clean. 

AMRAP sets would be a good example of this too--everyone knows it's as many reps as possible *with good form*.

For almost every lift, the number of repetitions I can complete with perfect form doesn't seem to ever exceed the point where I feel like I'm working truly hard to my brink. There are a couple of lifts where I really feel that point where my last rep was absolutely gutted out from my core (overhead press is one because past a certain point it's really just pushing the bar into the air), but for many lifts like barbell rows, RDLs, squats, and deadlifts, form breakdowns happen first.

,Fitness,"Hello All,

I just started a new routine that's incorporating LISS cardio. I'm also using Myfitnesspal to count calories.

I'm using a peloton bike for cardio, which is paired with a Garmin HRM run chest strap to measure my heart rate. I'm also wearing a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 watch. I input my stats (age, weight, etc) into both respective programs to get as accurate a burned calorie count as possible.

After doing my 45 minute LISS workout, aiming for an average heart rate of 60% of my VO2 max, I noticed a pretty significant discrepancy between the calorie counts of both devices. My bike said I burned around 400 calories while my watch said I burned around 320. I realize that neither device is going to be 100% accurate, but I was wondering which number I should trust more?

,Fitness,"Hello

I started doing cardio 2-3 months ago mainly for benefits related to generalized anxiety disorder. Unsurprisingly, it has numerous benefits such as more energy, more discipline, a feeling of freshness and so on.

I have very weak joints and for this reason, every time I have started weight-lifting, something started aching (knees, elbow). Most doctors (4-5) told me that my joints are not fully developed (?) and I should try not to stress them too much. For this reason, even though I really wanted to learn some kind of martial arts, I have refrained to do so. 

Running is out of the question, so the next thing I tried for some reason was rope jumping which lasted for 2ish weeks until my right knee started aching. After much trial and error, I have found that the elliptical machine works well for me so that's what I've been doing. 

I'm doing HIIT mode on the machine, half time on low resistance and half time on max resistance. I started with 30 minutes at first and have started doing 1 hour now.

I'd like to know, considering that other exercises are out of the question, how much cardio is enough for me to get max benefits for mental health and cardiovascular health? I am feeling like I still have much energy after 1-hour work out

And the second question, should I tire myself 100%? Should I feel absolutely exhausted after it's over? 

Third question: is HIIT  a good way to go or should I rather do more stable but high resistance training?

I (29/176cm/72kg) am looking for a plan that takes 40-45 minutes and that I can do every day.

The goal is to build more muscle and be generally fit. 

I used to do PPL exactly like in the wiki for about 1,5 years. (one workout took me around 60-75min)

Now to get back at it, I am doing stronglifts + accessories since 2 months.  
I also want to have a regimen where i can go to the gym every day at the same time to build consistency. 

My question is:

  
Do I have to kick out some exercises or do you think it is possible to reach the time limit by reducing weight and limiting the rest periods to strictly 60 sec?

,Fitness,"Hello everyone! 

I'm working to get fit. Specifically, I (22F, 5'2"", 200lbs) am looking to lose about 40lbs of fat while maintaining as much muscle as I can. 

For the next five months, I have an exercise plan in place that includes hitting the gym 4 times a week and participating in active college clubs (MMA, Jui Jitsu, and swing dancing). This works out to an average of 2.5hrs of exercise a day. According to my math, I should be burning about 4,000 calories a week through these activities. 

My sedentary BMR is about 1,600 calories (22F, 5'2"", 200lbs). I would think that these activities would put me at a much higher ""activity level,"" increasing my BMR closer to 2,500.

The first picture is 2 years ago, when i was at my worst and injecting everything from heroin to meth and popping xanax and every drug you can name, weighing 58 kg/128 lbs to my current weight which is 78 kg/172 lbs standing 5'10 tall. 

I had some muscle memory and also high test levels naturally, which is why i put on weight easily with a pretty bad diet, but i work out very hard with a 3 day split, day 1 chest triceps, day 2 back biceps, day 3 legs and shoulders. 

Only downside is im growing too big for my david bowie shirt lol.

Choose life.

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the feedback, you guys made me feel better than any drug ever did.

EDIT: Progress is from 20-22 years old, and ive kept to mostly the same peogram and exercises, the 3 day split i mentioned above, but sometimes mixing it up with back and chest 1 day and arms another day my most common program and exercises went like this:

Day 1 chest/triceps
Flat bench 4 sets of 8 reps, 60 kg before and 85 kg after
4 sets of incline dumbell press for 8-15 reps, 25-30 kg
4 sets of cable flies 45 kg each side, 8-20 reps.
4-5 sets of tricep pushdowns changing from low weight to high weight, 45 kg to 80 kg.
4-5 sets of skullcrushers with dumbells, low weight high reps, 15 kg for 20ish reps.

Day 2 back/biceps 
5 sets of weighted pullups with 15 kg, 8 reps.
4 sets of lat pulldowns 80 kg, 8 reps.
4 sets of seated cable rows, 80 kg 8-12 reps.
5 sets of bicep curls with dumbells, 20 kg 8-16 reps
5 sets of hammer curls with cable, 50 kg for 8-20 reps.

Day 3 legs/shoulders 
5 sets of squats focusing on proper form, with 85 kg for 8-12 reps
5 sets of leg extensions 60-70 kg for 8-12 reps
5 sets of barbell overhead press 50 kg, 8-12 reps
Superset lateral raises 15 kg 5 sets for 8-16 reps with facepulls 30 kg 5 sets for 10-25 reps.

&lt;p&gt;The first picture is 2 years ago, when i was at my worst and injecting everything from heroin to meth and popping xanax and every drug you can name, weighing 58 kg/128 lbs to my current weight which is 78 kg/172 lbs standing 5&amp;#39;10 tall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some muscle memory and also high test levels naturally, which is why i put on weight easily with a pretty bad diet, but i work out very hard with a 3 day split, day 1 chest triceps, day 2 back biceps, day 3 legs and shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only downside is im growing too big for my david bowie shirt lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thank you so much for all the feedback, you guys made me feel better than any drug ever did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Progress is from 20-22 years old, and ive kept to mostly the same peogram and exercises, the 3 day split i mentioned above, but sometimes mixing it up with back and chest 1 day and arms another day my most common program and exercises went like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1 chest/triceps
Flat bench 4 sets of 8 reps, 60 kg before and 85 kg after
4 sets of incline dumbell press for 8-15 reps, 25-30 kg
4 sets of cable flies 45 kg each side, 8-20 reps.
4-5 sets of tricep pushdowns changing from low weight to high weight, 45 kg to 80 kg.
4-5 sets of skullcrushers with dumbells, low weight high reps, 15 kg for 20ish reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 back/biceps 
5 sets of weighted pullups with 15 kg, 8 reps.
4 sets of lat pulldowns 80 kg, 8 reps.
4 sets of seated cable rows, 80 kg 8-12 reps.
5 sets of bicep curls with dumbells, 20 kg 8-16 reps
5 sets of hammer curls with cable, 50 kg for 8-20 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 3 legs/shoulders 
5 sets of squats focusing on proper form, with 85 kg for 8-12 reps
5 sets of leg extensions 60-70 kg for 8-12 reps
5 sets of barbell overhead press 50 kg, 8-12 reps
Superset lateral raises 15 kg 5 sets for 8-16 reps with facepulls 30 kg 5 sets for 10-25 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has mostly been my program for 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"I've been trying to do better on my deadlifts, but it seems whenever I get to 225lb I seem to get a weird burning sensation in my lower abs that I believe is my hip flexor and then it feels tender for a couple days. It's not a hernia since I've had that checked already.

I can deadlift 135lb and 185lb pretty easily without any weird pain.

I've been going to the gym about a year and feel relatively fit.

Bench is at 255lb 2 rep max.

Squats I usually do a few sets of 225lb at 5 reps.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized I had weird form since I had my legs shoulder-width apart instead of hip-width apart. I stretch my hamstrings, hips, quads, groin, etc. after every workout. I even did some groin and hamstring stretches before got this sensation again during my deadlift.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: what's the best way to get stronger at my deadlifts? Should I do RDL's or just deadlift heavier weights with boosters? The sensation seems to trigger on my way up when the bar is below my knee.

**I do pretty crappy legs nowadays. I started out having a pretty solid leg day and then after about 3-4 months I started caring less and I've been lifting for about 11 months now. I really only work in squats, lunges, and calf raises on shoulder days as super sets and I play basketball typically once a week. Any core work I do is probably 2 ab exercises 3 times a week towards the end of the workout with my stretching at 10-15 reps like leg lifts, in-n-outs, sit-ups or twists.**

**I'm 200lb and 5 11'. I really only care about upper body since I store a lot of my fat in my thighs/quads so I don't look like I have chicken legs since my quads are naturally large.**

**Based on the suggestions I think I'll really just focus on volume and try deadlifting at 135lb at 15 reps with 4 sets or something like that to see how it goes.

## This week's topic: Balancing Training with Other Physical Activities

This Campfire is for those of you who have physical activities in your life other than just training - like playing a club sport, having a physically intense job, or hobbies like hiking or climbing. What have you done to balance those activities with your training? How do you schedule around them and ensure you're not burning yourself out?

[Progress pic!](https://imgur.com/a/Q3cUjBH)

Let me start this off by saying I've been lifting for around 8 years now. In the beginning, I did the classic bro split of 5 days a week, one muscle group per day. I built up a decent foundation of size and strength that way but eventually got really bored with it after about 5 years. The next 2 years were more experimental as I was playing around with changing up my rest times, rep ranges, types of workouts, volume, intensity, etc. I wasn't enjoying my workouts until I started doing a 6 day PPL routine. After about a solid year of running this, I've been hitting good numbers (for me at least) while still maintaining my weight. It took a lot of trial and error, but I'm finally happy with where I'm at so I've decided to share my achievement with ya'll.

I try to do at least 20 minutes of steady-state cardio and 1 hour of walking 3x a week.

**Diet**

I do a very loose version of IF so I'll fast anywhere between 12 hours to 30 hours depending on how busy I can keep myself. Weighing my food and tracking my calories was done religiously because I have a huge appetite so I'll eat even if I'm full. I allow myself 2300 calories a day and the macro breakdown is 200g protein, 200g carbs, 75g fat. Most of the time, I paid close attention to my weekly caloric intake. Some days I would only have 900-1200 calories and save the rest for a day I knew I was going out drinking or there was a special occasion. By the end of the week, I'd have anywhere between 4500-6000 calories to play with which was nice.

*Breakfast*:

Mostly coffee and water. I rarely eat breakfast unless I'm working out in the morning. Usually, I eat an apple pre-workout.

*Lunch 12pm - 4pm*: 

Either a turkey sandwich with mustard and an apple or ground beef with rice and an apple. 

*Dinner 7pm - 9pm*:

Baked chicken breast, roasted brussel sprouts, roasted green beans, grilled asparagus, 2-3 eggs with a slice of cheese, and soybean noodles with black beans, ground beef, a little grated parmesan, and pasta sauce. I usually skip dinner 2-3 times a week.

*Dessert* (always gotta have this):

Peanut butter and honey sandwich with an apple or whatever ice cream I got in my freezer.

*Snacks*:

Apple and protein shake with creatine post-workout. I eat a lot of apples.

That about covers everything. There's still plenty of work I need to do but I'm proud of how far I've come. Hopefully, this helps someone out there! Remember: Progress is slow, consistency is key, eat apples.

The majority of my work out is bodybuilding/strength training with 15 minutes of light cardio (incline walking) 6 days a week. My natural diet has always been intermittent fasting, I usually only eat a couple of meals between 12 and 6pm.

I started to see some progress after the first month in terms of strength and endurance on the cardio. After that i started to see little improvement on it.

,Fitness,"Good morning r/fitness, I had a question about going a bit heavier on farmers walks.

My gym has these barbell style bars for farmers walks that weigh about 5lb but can be used to put on a decent amount of weight.

I was experimenting a bit with it, walking 1 or 2 laps of 25 feet, until it was mentioned to me that I should try a quicker pace with small steps. When I was trying to pick up the pace I kept finding myself stepping out too far and turning it into a lunge which would overload my quads and I'd usually collapse pretty soon after. I was working with 215lb on each side and while it felt good to pick up and run with a bit I wanted to make sure I was aware of any issues with the forum of walking with it so I don't injure myself in anyway. I can Deadlift around 460lb right now so because the handles are a little high my goal is two 25ft laps of a 500lb total, ideally without messing myself up in any way. 

Video of me stepping out to far and subsequently crashing with 430lb:

Edit: It was pointed out to me the bars are most likely 25lb so total is 470lb. 

https://imgur.com/flgE9K7

Questions:

1) I Deadlift twice a week and was considering taking it easy on deadlifts and going heavy with this twice a week (my typical Deadlift frequency). Considering that this uses a lot more movement and muscle recruitment, would this be too much or should I try for once a week? 

2) Any tips on avoiding stepping out too far? I feel like it may have been me getting tired and subconsciously trying to get it done quicker. What would be a good goal for foot spacing and pace (slow-quick/small steps/bigger steps) 

3) Structurally speaking, I'm 140lb and 5'8 and have the feeling in the back of my head that I might not feel any strain gradually but might just snap one day. So on that note is there any cues I should be looking at to consider backing off on the weight?

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.

I am a 17 year old male lifter who has been lifting for almost 2 years now using the 3 day PPL routine for most of this time with 2 hour sessions.

i am wondering if perhaps it is worthwhile to switch to a full body training style as this has been recommended more so to me for 3 days than PPL.

should I transition to full body or stay with PPL? and if so, what sort of training split should I use?

,Fitness,"Hello. I'm a 13 years old gym goer, more specifically on a functional training class.

I have definetly packed on some muscle, and I enjoy the thrill of the sport, so that's good. However..

Our professor is basically doing now the same exercises every single day. Leg day? Well, let's just do squats and lunges 24/7. Oh, we're training glutes? Hip thrusts all day. Biceps? Bench press and curls, please! Abs? Crunches.

Not to mention that my classmates are lazy, and it results on classes that don't even get me pumped.

I know that these are very effective, but I'd like more variation so my body can be challenged.

I've recently tried bodyweight workouts, and they are amazing! I can do them at home and they make me exhausted for once, a rare event at the gym. I'm also noticing a slight more toned body when I do these exercises, which is good.

Is it important to note that the switch to bodyweight will be temporary. I'm planning to hire a personal trainer at a way better gym in my city, so I'm planning to do bodyweight while I'm waiting.

I also don't want a bodybuilder body. I want to be muscular, sure, but not at that level. Somewhere in the middle. And while I know calisthenics is good in doing that, but I had to ask here because of my age and there are also some extra details to note.

If you guys have any bodyweight workouts that target specific muscles, I would love to hear about them. 

And for those that wonder, yes, I'm getting enough protein. Yes, I am getting 7 hours of sleep.

,Fitness,"Male, 20yo, 165lbs, 6'0"" Mostly slim body with some belly fat and love handles.

Greetings, 

I have been working out (weightlifting) strenuously for the past 4-5 months. I have seen slight results in my visible muscle mass and even bigger results in my weight lifting capability. I have a friend that has been training me and we divide weekly workouts as follows:

Monday - Arms

Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday - Legs

Wednesday - Chest

Friday - Back

And we do abs and cardio at the end of every workout. 

I have never payed much attention to diet besides the casual ""look at nutrition labels and cringe but eat it anyway."" I don't know if I'm ready to bulk and I really don't want to spend money on meal prepping. To start off I want to start tracking my diet and see what kinds of nutrients I am in taking, which ones I am lacking, and which ones I'm exceeding.

&lt;p&gt;Greetings, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working out (weightlifting) strenuously for the past 4-5 months. I have seen slight results in my visible muscle mass and even bigger results in my weight lifting capability. I have a friend that has been training me and we divide weekly workouts as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday - Arms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday - Legs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday - Chest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday - Back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we do abs and cardio at the end of every workout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never payed much attention to diet besides the casual &amp;quot;look at nutrition labels and cringe but eat it anyway.&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m ready to bulk and I really don&amp;#39;t want to spend money on meal prepping. To start off I want to start tracking my diet and see what kinds of nutrients I am in taking, which ones I am lacking, and which ones I&amp;#39;m exceeding. Then eventually get into some healthier habits to speed up results and avoiding plateau. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a specific tool, app, or website you guys use to track your diet? Preferably one that would be personalized and might help signal what I need more or less of.

,Fitness,"Hi,

**Background:**

I am a 34 year old Male currently weighing 99kg/218 lbs at 6 feet 3 inch / 190cm. My weighing machine estimates me at about 26% body fat. I used to be 108 kg at one point in 2017 which was the most I have ever weighed. I was tired of weighing so much and looking the way I did and so I started working out and counting and cutting calories. I was down to about 85kg/190lbs in August 2018. The workouts were mostly unstructured full body weights about 2-3 times a week and some functional cardio type exercises the other 2-3 days. At that point many things happened and since then I have managed to gain a lot of the weight back.

**Current workout and lifts:**

Currently I am doing the Kinobody Warrior Shred program by Greg Gallagher for the past 3-4 months. However I am eating about 1800-1900 calories only which is below the 2200 recommended in the plan while eating about 160g protein daily. The part that appealed to me about this regime was the fact that it was a 3 day/week program which is usually how much time I am able to spare with my work travel commitments. My work travel involves places where I do not have access to a gym. After having run this program about halfway I am still not sure if this is the best way to go.

Sometime in 2018 I had purchased Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 2nd edition and read it all. However after reading more on /r/fitness and other forums I felt like this program might not be the best idea to go with a cut. Hence I have not tried it yet. I was also looking at the PPL program which many recommended for people starting out but the 6 day/week requirement put me off as I know I won't be able to keep that up.

My current lifts are at:

Flat Bench: 55 kg x 8. 1RM estimate (Strong app): 68

Deadlift: 80 kg x 8 1RM estimate ( Strong app): 99

Squat: 90 kg x 6 1RM estimate ( Strong app): 105

Overhead Press: 50 kg x 6 1RM estimate ( Strong app): 58

**Help needed:**

I feel like there is better more structured approach that I can possibly take to getting fitter and looking better and which is why I am posting here. I have read the wiki multiple times and have gone through all the recommended routines etc. also but am confused which would best apply to me. My goals are predominantly about looking better and not about how much I can lift or how strong I am.

Which program would be most suited to my needs looking at the 3/4 workouts per week limitation? Should I try 5/3/1 or GZCL and stick to it? If yes, which of the variants? Should I try PPL and just do as many workouts as I can per week? Should I just stick to the WSP plan I am currently doing? Do I need to add cardio to my workout regime?

As far as diet goes I think I want to cut till I can get to the 80kg/176 lbs region and then think about bulking up.

,Fitness,"Hey everyone,

I'm pretty inexperienced at weightlifting (I know what I'm doing in the gym I just can't lift much lol) and am looking for a little advice on workouts to build some muscle. I'm 20 years old, 6'0"", 150ish pounds, so obviously pretty skinny. After doing a bit of research it looks like my best bet is going to be bulking up, as it's probably unhealthy to try to lose any weight and I don't have a whole lot of muscle that that would reveal anyways.

I've been going to the gym for the past month or so (about 3 times per week), and usually alternate upper body and lower body lifting followed by some cardio (swimming, rowing machine, biking). I feel good about doing cardio, but my big question is if it's hurting any muscle gains? Is it a waste of time and just burning calories that would be better used to help restore/build my muscles?

Additionally, I looked into a macronutrient calculator ([https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/macronutrients\_calculator.htm](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/macronutrients_calculator.htm)) which tells me I should be consuming about 200 grams of protein per day. That's insane to me. I don't keep track of my diet at all, but I know I'm not eating anywhere near that (probably less than 100g but I don't really know).

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty inexperienced at weightlifting (I know what I&amp;#39;m doing in the gym I just can&amp;#39;t lift much lol) and am looking for a little advice on workouts to build some muscle. I&amp;#39;m 20 years old, 6&amp;#39;0&amp;quot;, 150ish pounds, so obviously pretty skinny. After doing a bit of research it looks like my best bet is going to be bulking up, as it&amp;#39;s probably unhealthy to try to lose any weight and I don&amp;#39;t have a whole lot of muscle that that would reveal anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been going to the gym for the past month or so (about 3 times per week), and usually alternate upper body and lower body lifting followed by some cardio (swimming, rowing machine, biking). I feel good about doing cardio, but my big question is if it&amp;#39;s hurting any muscle gains? Is it a waste of time and just burning calories that would be better used to help restore/build my muscles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I looked into a macronutrient calculator (&lt;a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/macronutrients_calculator.htm""&gt;https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/macronutrients_calculator.htm&lt;/a&gt;) which tells me I should be consuming about 200 grams of protein per day. That&amp;#39;s insane to me. I don&amp;#39;t keep track of my diet at all, but I know I&amp;#39;m not eating anywhere near that (probably less than 100g but I don&amp;#39;t really know).

,Fitness,"Hey,

Before I begin, I just wanted to share that I think this may be hugely downvoted; however, I do not know of any other subreddits so sorry.

Briefly, my fitness journey began \~12 years ago, just before I entered high school. Prior to that, I was a bit overweight/fat, but my teenage-self knew that girls liked fit guys so I started to workout and eat healthily. Since then, I have been a gym rat, but admittedly one that has been running around kind of ""blind"". Even though I managed to shave \~40lbs from my highest weight back then, and now standing at 5'8/9% BF/145lbs (being short sucks), I still feel like I haven't achieved my desired body, but I don't know what that is.

What I do know is that I don't want to look too bulky - ""a bowling ball"". Additionally, I play \~8-10 hours of basketball per week (mostly after working out).

I currently follow a 6-day training split (basketball isn't factored in). The gym serves as a healthy, positive outlet for me, both physically and mentally, so I spend quite a bit of time there despite my frenzied work and graduate school demands. 

My main focus is to look really good (I have self-proclaimed OCD so even the slightest details matter), while having the capacity to perform in all other areas of life. Also, basketball is huge to me, and despite my shorter stature, I have a nice 3-point shot, which is something I don't want weightlifting to hinder.

Something that is weird to me is working out to ""maintain"", since I always had general goals, whether it was losing fat, weight, or getting tone. 

As I type this, I have no idea what the intentions of this post are. 

Should I curate my own program that addresses what my needs are? For example, hypertrophy in the upper chest, strength in arms/shoulders, hypertrophy in abs, strength in legs, and whatever it may be?

I guess where I am getting at is, can I curate a program that combines both hypertrophy and strength training to specific muscles that I want to work on? Should I just chill a bit back on the gym (I don't really want to do this because I get really lethargic, ultimately affecting all the other things that I have to do).

Additionally, are there specific workouts/routines that are known to bolster the ideal physique?

,Fitness,"Hello everyone.

Recently I have been acquainted with the FST-7 program and have already tried a day or two on it. The program is supposed to emphasize hypertrophy above all else which is my ultimate goal and at the end of working out one muscle section one is supposed to do 7 sets of 8-12 reps. The other sets however typically lists 3-4 sets of 5-8. 

The program is vague on how one should approach these sets however. I am wondering what weight one should shoot for for the different sets? My thought would be the 5-8 would be heavier and the 7 sets of 8-12 would be somewhat lighter but there's no way to tell. 

Overall im receiving conflicting information on how heavy or light the weights are to be with some saying that its supposed to be heavier and other sources saying lighter. Additionally, my guess for the 5-8 sets would be to start lighter and hit 8 then 7 then 6 going marginally heavier? 

Another thing that I am confused about is rest periods. The 7 sets are clear the rest should be no more than 45 seconds between them but the others say 1 minute to 3 minutes. Is this not a bit long? My thought would be that minimal rest is better for hypertrophy.

,Fitness,"Hello fitness people!

Since I began doing this exercise as a part of a programme soon a year ago, I fell in love with it almost right away (everyone has their favourites), but after wondering ""if I'm doing it right and are my results (lifter %) on strengthlevel.com real?"" for several months, I finally decided to ask you guys! As my main focus with fitness is kayaking, it's extra important to me to get my rowing exercises done properly.

Basically what I would like to have confirmed or debunked is the following: the way I see it, based on information online (mainly Youtube ""how-to""-videos) and my personal experience doing the exercise, is that it can be divided into two ways of doing it, with both appear to be considered to be the right way. I'm only describing the part(s) that differ and I would like clarity on, not for instance feet positioning.

In the one case (#1) the movement consists of the elbow doing an arc upwards to be level with the lat and in some cases going higher, so that instead the DB is level with the lat. This to me feels like the movement engages the triceps as well.

On the other hand (#2), another way of doing the exercise appears to be a simple upwards movement of the elbow so that the DB touches the pectoral. This movement to me feels like it engages the biceps as well.

In How-to vid's and in my book(s) for demonstrative purposes the DB used is quite (IMHO) light. In addition, when lifting a heavy DB the size of it makes it impractical to lift it beside the body (case #1)

What I would like to know is

1. Have I misunderstood this exercise completely?
2. If my goal with the exercise is to train my back (targeting the lats), am I doing it right?
3. There isn't two ways of doing the exercise, it's all in my head and I've been obsessing over nothing and wasted your time reading this.

My Favorite workouts are deadlift and squats. I need to work on my bench press. I started with light weights making sure my form was on point and when i felt comfortable i started adding weight. I’m on my last phase of my lean bulk and will be starting my cut next month.  

Diet:
My diet consist of high protein, moderate carbs and fats. I usually eat oats and protein shake for breakfast, grilled chicken breast or tuna + veggies and rice for my 2nd and 3rd meal and i like to eat protein bars as a snack. Also having enough sleep is a key to success as it helps in muscle recovery. 

Thoughts:

To be honest, the hardest thing about working out is not knowing when to start. From my experience, the best time to start is now. And if you stay commited and consistent you will reach your goal. I would like to thank you guys for inspiring me and for helping me reach the best version of my self.

,Fitness,"I'm looking at staring [Jim Wendler's: Building the Monlith](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size) in a couple of months once am happy to switch away from nSuns 5day LP and had a couple of questions regarding exercise changes/choices.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I should preface this by saying that getting stronger and getting bigger are both important to me, however, I would say a lean slightly more towards wanting to focus on gaining mass. Programs that are structured using the 5/3/1 method are more appealing to me because I just enjoy lifting low rep high intensity. I have had a couple of injuries in the past due to being an ego lifting, Gumby look-a-like, but over the last year I have really started getting into a groove and really improving with my lifting. 

&amp;#x200B;

One injury I have had in the past was on my lift hip. I had some tendinitis in my hip which meant I was unable to squat for a long period of time. A month or so ago I decided that I would start squatting again, and only my second back squat session back, I felt the slightest sensation of my hip flaring up again so I thought I would have to ease off the squatting again. Funnily enough, I realised that when I did my accessory front squats on a Thursday, I didn't have the same nagging issues as I did with back squats. Ever since I have replaced all back squatting with front squats, and I have to say I find it so much more enjoyable/comfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of my lack of squatting, my lower body has really started lagging behind my other lifts. I was really really skinny when I started out lifting, and doing little to no legs has really messed me up. My whole lower body is a weak point, but I would say that my glutes and hamstrings are lagging further behind that my quads are. Another weak point (aesthetically) I have is my upper chest. I have made pretty good progress with my bench press (45kg - 85kg) but I would definitely say that my upper chest looks pretty hollow.

&amp;#x200B;

# My Questions 

When switching to BTM, I would like to only do front squats. This will shift the main focus of my leg training to my quads which will be detrimental to my already lagging hamstrings and glutes. Can/should I offset this with the addition of Romanian Deadlifts and/or Hipthrusts? If so, where would you suggest I add them in and with what sort of volume/intensity? I'm having a hard time trying to figure out if this will burn me out, or if it will even really be a problem in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Second. I wouldn't mind changing the flat bench press to incline to help address my lagging upper chest, but I wouldn't want it to effect my progress on flat bench (In terms of 1RM). Has anyone had any experience with only incline benching and if it had any effects on their flat bench 1RM? My main concern is that I lift about 20kg less on incline than flat, so in my head I'm thinking it could possibly reduce my flat bench 1RM (I have no experience in this so I could be wrong)

&amp;#x200B;

I have made pretty good progress with my bench press (45kg - 85kg) but I would definitely say that my upper chest looks pretty hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My Questions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When switching to BTM, I would like to only do front squats. This will shift the main focus of my leg training to my quads which will be detrimental to my already lagging hamstrings and glutes. Can/should I offset this with the addition of Romanian Deadlifts and/or Hipthrusts? If so, where would you suggest I add them in and with what sort of volume/intensity? I&amp;#39;m having a hard time trying to figure out if this will burn me out, or if it will even really be a problem in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind changing the flat bench press to incline to help address my lagging upper chest, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t want it to effect my progress on flat bench (In terms of 1RM). Has anyone had any experience with only incline benching and if it had any effects on their flat bench 1RM? My main concern is that I lift about 20kg less on incline than flat, so in my head I&amp;#39;m thinking it could possibly reduce my flat bench 1RM (I have no experience in this so I could be wrong)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really appreciate any help that you guys can give me!&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness," I started lifting around September time 2019, although I was in good shape beforehand. I wanted to get a little bit bigger, bit mainly just stronger whilst staying lean. My initial 1RMs for each exercise were:

Bench: 57kg (125lbs)

Deadlift: 95kg (210lbs)

Overhead Press: 35kg (77lbs)


I did do squats but I have recently stopped due to knee issues which I do not want to worsen.

For the first couple of months up to Christmas, I ran 5/3/1 for my main lifts and mixed and matched accessory work, including bits of bodyweight various arm work. In terms of diet, I wasn't specifically bulking or cutting but I'd consider my diet to be pretty healthy. By Christmas my 1RMs had progressed to 71 (155), 110 (240) and 45 (100) on bench, deadlift and OHP respectively. 

At this stage I decided to have a go at writing my own programme. 5/3/1 had worked pretty well (although I'm fairly confident in my assumption that almost anything would have worked since I'm so new) so I based it off the same structure. The program is a 3 week cycle and I generally work out three days a week, doing each of my three main lifts twice:

Week 1
5x80%
2-4x85%
1+x90%
3 sets of 5x60-70%

Week 2
5x80%
2-4x85%
1+x95%
3 sets of 5x65-75%

Week 3
5x85%
2-4x90%
1+x100%
3 sets of 5x70-80%

All the percentages are of my 1RM, and where a range of reps or weight is given I judge this by exercise and how my body feels (e.g deadlift sets are usually on the lighter end of the range otherwise can barely walk the next day). I do a variety of accessory work after these lifts, I keep a note and try to keep progression fairly steady. I have a few bodyweight/calisthenics goals in mind as well as just keeping my general conditioning high with this. I've currently been running this for one cycle whilst on a bit of a mini cut to mitigate the damage from Christmas, but at the end of my first three weeks I managed two reps of my max weight on bench and deadlift plus three on OHP.

Here is a pic:  http://imgur.com/a/FQAiCzE

So far I've really enjoyed the ride, and just want to thank the community for giving me the info I needed to get started. I think my biggest weakness is that I haven't yet managed to commit to a long enough period of bulking or even have run the same program for long enough to know what really works for me - but that's a work in progress (I've got a 2 month bulk planned starting February). 

*I also have a question regarding my programs' progression: I plan to increase the weight I lift by 1-5kg on every set (i.e *not* increase my 1RM and recalculate percentages), and for my first cycle am thinking 3kg (6.5lbs) for bench, 4kg (9lbs) for deadlift and 2kg (4.5lbs) for OHP.

4. I've tried replacing it with safety bar squats, which has helped because I can still do another compound like the rack pull afterwards because the SSB takes some of the stress of your lower back. However I have the same issues as the regular squat.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried replacing it with safety bar squats, which has helped because I can still do another compound like the rack pull afterwards because the SSB takes some of the stress of your lower back. However I have the same issues as the regular squat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to replace squats with RDLs and split squats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, should I replace the squat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; - Will try the high bar squat.&lt;/p&gt;

* Male
* 23 Years Old
* 178 cm (5’10”)
* 68 kg (150 lbs)

I’ll keep this long story short. I used to be very active in high school, mainly in martial arts and running. Once I got out of school, I stop playing sports and never watch what I ate. Before I knew it, I had a gut. My main goal was loose fat, gain muscle, and be more aware of what I’m eating.

#Workout

I decided to go with a full body workout routine, where I did a full body workout 3 times a week. Every day there was an five exercises, one for each category: push, pull, legs, curl, extension. “Push” targeted chest and shoulders. “Pull” targeted the back and shoulders. “Legs” worked all the leg muscles and the core. “Curl” targeted the bicep and forearm. “Extension” targeted the tricep and backarm. 

[Workout Chart](https://imgur.com/5aNLyUz)

**Day A:**

* Run (3 Miles)
* Bench Press (3 x 5-10)
* Barbell Row (3 x 5-10)
* Squat (3 x 5-10)
* Bicep Curl (3 x 5-10)
* Tricep Press (3 x 5-10)

**Day B:**

* Run (3 Miles)
* Incline Bench Press (3 x 5-10)
* Seated Row (3 x 5-10)
* Deadlift (3 x 5-10)
* Hammer Curl (3 x 5-10)
* Cable Pulls (3 x 5-10)

**Day C:**

* Run (3 Miles)
* Dumbbell Press (3 x 5-10)
* Lat Pulldown (3 x 5-10)
* Hack Squat (3 x 5-10)
* Cable Curl (3 x 5-10)
* Overhead Extension (3 x 5-10)

I started with a 3 mile run on the treadmill for a full 30 minute cardio workout. Then I followed up with strength training, doing progressive overload for each exercise around 70%-90% of my maximum rep. If I could do 3 sets of 10 consistently on an exercise, it means it was time to bump up the weight. Strength training took about 30 minutes, which means I spent a total of one hour to one hour and fifteen minutes at the gym. Considering I was only going to the gym 3 days week, this routine provided a perfect work-life balance.

#Diet

I originally tried keto for two weeks, but I was constantly hungry, tired, dizzy, and sometimes I wanted to vomit. I gave up and did some research. I came across The Harvard Food Pyramid (not the same as the FDA Food Pyramid), which gave a simple eating guide that was based on science.  

[Harvard University Nutrition Guide](https://imgur.com/a/ngeHP0H)

* 3+ Serving Of Whole Grain Carbs
* 2-3 Servings of Fruit
* 2-3 Servings of Veggies
* 2+ Servings of Meat 
* 1-2 Servings of Diary
* 1-3 Servings of Nuts
* Include Plant Oils (Such As Olive Oil)
* Use Sparing Added Sugar, Butter, White Bread

This diet is very simple to follow. I reduced my intake on soda, beer, and candy to around once a week. I replaced my white bread with whole grain bread, white rice with brown rice, white pasta with whole grain pasta, and added oatmeal to ensure my diet was high in fiber. Fun fact: Fiber will always keep you full. I eat protein every meal, usually eggs, milk, and/yogurt. I have some sort of meat, whole grain carbs, and veggie for lunch and dinner, with dinner usually having two servings of meat (for protein) and veggies (for vitamins). And I snack on healthy foods in between meals such as nuts, granola bars, and fruit. I always make sure I stay hydrated with water. 

Here is a typical eating day for me. Breakfast: Oatmeal, Eggs, Yogurt, and Banana. Lunch: Tuna Salad Sandwich on whole grain with Broccoli and Orange. Snack: Almonds. Dinner: Two pieces of Chicken Breast, Brown Rice with curry, Sweet Potato, Black Beans, and Mix Veggies. I didn’t count calories, carbs, or macros. Additionally, I didn’t do protein shakes or supplements. I just made sure that I got my servings of food and all of the important nutrition I need would fall into place.  

#Conclusion

Here Are My Current Maximums:

* **Bench Press:** 84 kg (185 lbs)
* **Squat:** 113 kg (250 lbs) 
* **Deadlift:** 104 kg (230 lbs)

Overall, I am really happy with these results. This subreddit gave me a lot of useful information and seeing the transformations post keep me inspired.

,Fitness,"Hi Reddit, my first post ever on here so please bare with.

Male - 22 - 6'2.5 (190cm) - 100kg(\~220lbs)

[BEFORE (ples dont mind my ugly face)](https://imgur.com/a/RpuCLCi)

[AFTER](https://imgur.com/a/7I5LMx3)

**Intro**

Firstly, i've never been bothered about how my body looked, and no one really said anything against how I looked, however, it was always about my strength. I went to a boy school so things got physical there, and my strength was challenged a lot; so much so that people were surprised if I lifted something fairly heavy. So being strong was my aim. I was always active and played football, cycling and jogging a lot, but little to no weight lifting.

I was 18 when I started, which was the year I was going to University, I specifically waited for this year as I would have more free time and be more independent in what I ate and how I lived my life. I lived at my uni campus (2 hour drive away from home).

**2016-2017 - Skinny Noodle**

With little to no research - I started a ""bro split""kinda work out (I hit each body part once a week). I thought I was strong, and to be fair I think I was. I was benching around 50kg for 6/7 reps during the end of 2016. My back was definitely strong (through back rowing, one arm row, pull ups -6reps ). The highest I could deadlift was 90kg. I tried to DL 100kg in front of my uni mates and I kid you not, I nearly passed out.

My diet in 2016 - 2017 was appalling now looking back. I did not track my calories until 6/7 months after I started gym. It was definitely below the recommended. And I ate a lot of processed food. I started my first cut 6/7 months in as I just wanted to look like I had muscle, which was a mistake. My main foods consisted  of:

* Eggs
* chicken
* meatballs
* green veg
* porridge (with a scoop of mass gainer )
* wholemeal bread

In conclusion, 2016 was a massive learning curve for me, spent countless nights watching YouTube videos, researching how the body works, and meals which guaranteed the best gains.

Weighed 78kg

**2017-2018 - The year of the vicious bulk**

After around a year of going through mistakes in mainly my diet; I started to find out what works well for my body, the best routines etc. Major changes I made was body split to PPL(push pull legs). Followed a 5x5 type training. Removed all processed foods apart from shakes. And now incorporated fruit smoothies with a scoop of whey. NOW LET THE BULK BEGIN (6+ month bulk)

Followed a strict PPL. 5 days a week &gt; 2 rest. Then the following week, 6 days a week &gt; 1 rest. Repeat.

I ate 5 meals a day :

* Weetabix with peanut butter
* Wholemeal bread with eggs
* Wholemeal bread, ham and cheese ""toastie"".
* Fruit smoothie with 1 or 2 scoops of whey
* Rice/Pasta with chicken/tuna and veg

I was easily eating around 3300cal a day. Going to the gym 5/6 times a week for months. Slept 8+ hours a day, except the days we went clubbing.

**Until...**

I was incredibly fatigued for at least 5 days. My body was in so much pain and it hurt to even walk long distance, my muscles wanted to retire. I crashed bad; and that is when I found out that you're supposed to take a week break around every 3 months.

My exercises exploded as I was on this bulk - Benched 90kg for 5 reps, squat - 110kg for 5 reps, barbell rows - 60kg. I had to say bye to pull ups as my additional fat made it harder to lift my body weight. Moreover, I barely trained my arms compared to chest for some reason, so I plateaued.

In conclusion - people noticed how strong I was getting, and I had a few compliments of my  transformation compared to the previous year.

Weighed 90kg

**2018 - 2019/20 - Ultimate comeback**

At this point I was well aware of what I was doing in the gym. I knew/know near enough all there is to bodybuilding, and it was just a case of being patient and making sure I met my macros. At this point I had just gone through a cut and I looked shredded than i've ever been. Was even surprised at the veins I had on my abs, but all i wanted to do was to be strong so I went on a soft bulk; 100cal above maintenance and some days just ate maintenance but made sure I had enough protein and fats. Rotated between 4x6 training an 8x3 training around every 2/3 months.

My lifts towards the end of the year were:

* Bench Press - 100kg for 5
* Barbell Row - 90kg for 8
* Deadlift - 210kg for 2
* Squats - 150kg for 5
* OHP 50kg for 8

My diet stayed pretty much the same. 5 Meals a day:

* 2 \* Fruit smoothie with whey (\~500cal each)
* Rice and tuna
* Peanut butter jelly (for the fats ;)
* Dinner

In conclusion - ""we're in the end game now"".

Weighed 100kg

**What I've learned (positives and negatives)**

* Compound movements are the biggest priorty
* Diet before anything - your body reacts to it sooooo easily
* Rest is very very important
* CONSISTENCY
* You actually grow when you're not going to the gym, so your body can finally rebuild what has been teared.
* I sweat so easily it's annoying.

**Next goals**

* 105kg
* Bigger calves (the bane of my life)
* Better cardiovascular health

Thanks for the time.

Recently, through the course of injury rehab, I've become a convert to church of eccentric exercises - currently for calf and hammies.

From my experience, body weight eccentric exercises have been crazy beneficial for my flexibility, muscle hangover, and muscle tension. So I was wondering if people ever incorporate a dedicate eccentric routine to target muscles in the same way a lot of people focus on the big 4 for concentric exercise? and if so, how do you about doing so?

I'm still figuring out the best way to do these for some groups, but seems to me it's as beneficial, if not more so, than post-workout stretching.",t2_8c6hg,False,,0,False,"Does anyone do an ""eccentric big four"", or similar?",[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_epy21f,False,dark,,public,54,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,54,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579281090.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

,Fitness,"Really can't seem to google up the answer I'm looking for exactly. I constantly do reverse curls, dips, and push downs. I know I'm getting plenty of long head work, but after 4 years of training I've yet to find an overhead movement that actually activates my long head better than any of those options or just outright feels comfortable.

Skull crushers are decent but incomparable to the previously mentioned, for me at least. Overhead cable work feels awkward no matter how many times I revisit it with a rope or single hand grip, and likewise with overhead DB extensions. All of them always feel awkward and are lackluster in activation for me.

Is there really any reason to revisit overhead work here, or any recommendations from people that were in a similar boat?

**Edit:** if this gets archived and anyone is looking at it.

The consensus seems to be that you can only reach the maximum stretch point of the tricep with overhead movements but none the less if you dont do overhead movements your missing out on a insignificant percent of gains.

My last 2 push days I've revisited skull crushers at the end of the workout with really low weight, 30-50 pounds, and just focused on going really slow like people have mentioned.

I've also added overhead rope extensions, but I am pulling from above the head rather than the floor. Again, at the end, light weight, and really slow.

I think I'm going to keep this up on top of my regular tricep work for a few months.

6’4 (193.04 cm)

295lbs (133kg) to 224lbs (101.6 kg)

[Here’s a pic but I’m really awkward for photos so don’t mind the strange faced selfie](https://imgur.com/nD8LJVd)

This has been one of the longest years of my life but not even because of the weight loss. I wanted to make a mini post on how my year has affected me besides just my weight. These are all the things that I did a little air fist bump because it was such an annoyance to me. 

At the start of my weight loss journey I focused on cardio and did some basic strength machines, I did these 4 to 5 times a week. When I started, I sucked at running, I played football and threw in track, so I was only taught how to lift and never focused on extended running. The first month was me just working my way up to 3.1 miles because I wanted to start running in 5ks. I think to work for a goal that seemed more easily achievable at the time rather than just focusing on losing weight helped in the beginning. I ran a lot and eventually I began to enjoy it. I got to the point where 3.1 miles (5km) in 30 min, was no longer soul sucking, around that time my weight plateaued. That’s when I began running 5 miles to toughen my workout and that was where I went wrong. I learned that pushing yourself the absolute limit is not the only way to go. I was at the gym for almost 2 hours an hour for running and an hour of machines and I wasn’t losing as much weight as I usually did. 

It wasn’t until last August where I decided to look at what I ate a bit more. Like I said earlier, in Football as a lineman I was told to “eat eat eat”, “be an animal”, “get huge”, and was led to an unhealthy diet. I started limiting my portion sizes to just be smaller. At this time my weight plummeted, I was losing around 10 pounds (4.5kg) a month and I didn’t even count calories, I just started to think, I don’t need that much. I only started counting calories a couple of months back because I think I’ve gotten to the point where my body doesn’t have an unlimited amount of energy anymore, some days it was incredibly hard to finish a run and I just felt shitty. So, I started to make sure I eat around 1300 to 1500 calories a day and eat a little more before I work out. 

I wanted to list some little accomplishments that seem small but was huge to me. 

· I sweat less when running. I would sweat for almost an hour after running, now it stops immediately.

· All my clothes from middle school fit me now, so now I have some extra clothes.

· Some girls flirted with me at a party, that felt nice.

· I catch my breath much faster than I did before, IDK if it's possible to not feel winded walking up a huge hill to class.

· I can see muscles now especially my arms and back

· I look a lot better.

Now here are some things that I don’t like about my new healthy lifestyle

· I have my meals thought up for the entire week, a random friend’s trip to get food stresses me out now.

· Most of my clothes don’t fit and as a college student, I can’t just buy new clothes.

· Even though I lost so much weight I feel like I’m not as satisfied as I thought I would be. 

· Seeing my weight loss slowed down is slightly disheartening.

· It’s the minority but I do have some friends that make me feel bad for not eating with them

· I kind of feel flimsy now, I used to “feel” big and strong.

· I only recently have gotten back into lifts but I’m really weak now.

· On some subreddits I follow, I get a little jealous when I see someone lose so much more weight than I, some people are losing over 100 pounds in a year wtf.

· Loose skin, Nuff said.

What are my next goals?

· I want to get to 210 than evaluate on how much more I should lose.

· I want to get back into my lifts and gain more muscle so I can feel strong again.

· I want to run more 5k’s and get below 25 min.

· Don’t fall back into a bad diet but I doubt I will again.",t2_1kd13uhm,False,,0,False,My one-year Fitness journey – 295 to 224,[],r/Fitness,False,6,,0,False,t3_ep4v2s,False,dark,,public,1256,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1256,,False,,1579179492.0,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1579136308.0,text,6,,,text,self.Fitness,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;M 21&lt;/p&gt;

[Before and after](https://i.redd.it/877betlk97941.jpg?1)

Note: English is not my first language so please try to ignore the grammatical errors and correct me so that I can improve. Thanks. 

I Started going to the gym on 31 Dec' 2018 and today it feels like I have actually achieved something in my life. Gym became my new life, never skipped a single day and never skipped a good night's sleep. Lots of mistakes were made and I learnt a lot from them.

**Athletic background and genetics** 

Played football for 8 years straight from the age of 8 to 16. 

My mom and day are very fit. My father was in the army when I was born and my mother has always been slim (5'3"" Under 50 KG probably). 

**Diet** 

It was so difficult to calculate the calorie intake because I always ate whatever my mom cooked at home but anyway I did it one day. It turned out to be 2700-3000 which I am pretty sure is definitely not accurate. 

About the protein, I drink 800-1000 ml of milk everyday, and I get the rest of my protein from pulses, eggs (10 egg whites per day, started eating eggs from march), nuts, peanut butter and whey protein 25 gram scoop post workout and 15 gram scoop after waking up.

My diet game has always been week. Even after joining the gym I didn't eat much nutrient rich food. Sometimes I did sometimes I did not. To make up for my nutrient low diet I ate 5-6 times a day, 3 main meals and the rest being snacks (Heavily peanut buttered breads with 300ml of milk, eggs, etc) or sometimes proper meals. My main source of protein was always Milk, Yogurt (homemade), egg whites, pulses, etc. 

**Supplements** 

I never took any other supplement other than Protein and Creatine. 

I started using Whey Protein and creatine from June - July. In Oct I started taking Isolate Protein. Right now I am using Whey and stopped the intake of creatine.

**Training and mistakes** (mostly mistakes)

I trained single body part everyday and I still do that now. I only did the exercises that the Gym trainer told me.

I mostly exercised with the friends that I made at the gym. 

I started training my abs from March and have been training them everyday since then.  

In September I started to realise how bad (not so effective) exercises I have been doing since the beginning. In October I COMPLETELY changed my training schedule and started to understand how the body actually works. Until November I didn't even know which body part the exercises I used to do targeted.  

One of the biggest mistakes that I made was that I never did many compound movement exercises like Deadlift, weighted squats and Overhead press. I started these exercises in mid October and these are my current numbers: 

Numbers now vs numbers when I started in October

**Note** - The numbers below include the weight of the barbell. The barbell I use in every lift weighs 20 KG. 

**Deadlift - 150 KG × 2 rep max** from 110 KG 

**Overhead Press - 60 KG × 6 rep max** from 30 KG (I just realised I fucked up while posting in other subs. I calculated the weight of the barbell and only the weight of the plates on one side, totalling to 40KG. That's probably why everyone was  confused about my OHP being so low).

**Weighted Squats - 140 KG × 4 rep max** from 90 KG (Note: Before ever doing weighted squats I used to do Leg Press every week and my highest was 280 KG × 4 Reps). 

**Bench press - 90 KG × 6 rep max**  (Note:  I train my chest on Saturday and I am just so worn out from all the work and other things. Also, I do supersets while benching. I am pretty sure I can do 1 rep of 110 KG or maybe more)

Looking back at how used to train it was just horrible. Sometimes the sets per body part used to go 30+ and this was repeated so so many times. 

Also, I never ever did cardio even for 5 mins. 

My current training schedule is: 

Monday - [Back](https://youtu.be/eE7dzM0iexc) + Middle and Lower traps *(Y reverse prone raises and)*  w/Deadlift, Lower abs

Tuesday - [Shoulder](https://youtu.be/jv31A4Ab4nA) + Upper traps *(Barbell front and rear shrugs and Dumbbell side shrugs)* , Obliques 

Wednesday - [Legs](https://youtu.be/RjexvOAsVtI) w/Weighted Squats, Abs 

Thursday - [Triceps](https://youtu.be/tMyFe-IL7Ks) + Reverse inclined Kickback and Skull crusher, Lower abs

Friday - [Biceps](https://youtu.be/gozU3CUIizs) + Middle and Lower traps *(Standing cable Y raise and Reverse prone T raise)*, Obliques

Saturday - [Chest](https://youtu.be/89e518dl4I8) + Legs w/leg press, abs

I divided the same leg workout to two days and added extra exercises for calves each day.

Sets and reps - I only do 3 sets of each exercise (even if in the video it's mentioned 4 sets) and my rep range is 12, 10 and 8 with increasing weight in the next set. Before October I used to do 4 sets of each exercise and 15, 12, 10 and 8 reps. 

I train 6 days a week. 1.5 - 2 hours each day.

It took me a week to come up with this schedule, it's probably not the best but it's perfect for me right now. 

**Misc**

When I went to the gym I weighted 57 KG and now I weigh 73 KG.

I tried doing pull-ups on my first day and I was only able to do 3 half-assed pull-ups. But now I can do 30 (Max 35) clean pull-ups. I have been doing them in every two days since the first day.

People in other thread were really doubting how I got such shoulders because my OHP is so low and were accusing me of using roids. I have been doing dumbbell overhead press (25 KG max × 8 reps) since I started training shoulders. 

I did not use any roids or anything. It's upto you whether you want to believe it or not. 

I will only keep on pushing and get only better.

Thanks to my gym buddies for getting me where I am today.

&lt;p&gt;People in other thread were really doubting how I got such shoulders because my OHP is so low and were accusing me of using roids. I have been doing dumbbell overhead press (25 KG max × 8 reps) since I started training shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not use any roids or anything. It&amp;#39;s upto you whether you want to believe it or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will only keep on pushing and get only better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my gym buddies for getting me where I am today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. &lt;/p&gt;

Here's my question after my ""too much information explanation"".

I've been giving it everything I got on my Airdyne but my improvements are painstakingly slow.  Its been 3 years and I want the gains in calories burned to improve quicker. I use the calories burned simply as a marking tool for gauging my output.

Here's a few of my rides:

3min warm up, 20sec work, 10 secs rest, 8 sets, 5min cool down at a decent pace once I kind of recover from the Tabata

3min warm up, 10min as hard as I can ride

3min warm up 5mins all out, 2 min rest 5min all out, 2min rest 5min all out (doing this as it simulates World Brazilian jiu-jitsu masters divisions match length)

Any ideas to help me increase my output? More carbs, more protein, more rest, any input would be great.

So I started a C25K program like many do then kept going to a 10K goal.  I'm now up to 55 min runs.

I looked at the [r/c25k faq](https://old.reddit.com/r/C25K/wiki/faq).  I know it's not gospel, but two answers stuck out to me:

#### Should I skip rest days?

&gt; No. Assuming a M/W/F running schedule, T/Th/S/Su should be observed rest days. These are your sabbath days of running. Upper body work, cross training, and calisthenics are all okay during three of these days.

#### Can I reduce the number of rest days between weeks?

&gt; Yes, instead of having 2 rest days between weeks, it's fine to reduce it to only one.

OK... all clear so far.  In any month I can choose to run on all the ***odd numbered days*** and ""cross train"" on all the ***even numbered days***.  This is exactly what I do.  So, right now, I run for ~55 min on odd days and swim for ~55 min (don't judge) on even days.

I feel fine and my heart rate stays in the correct band for my (advancing / M49) age.  Despite all of this my fitness tracker is chastising me continually for doing too much anaerobic cycles.  Perhaps it's just an overly concerned AI.  But I feel I should check myself.

&lt;p&gt;OK... all clear so far.  In any month I can choose to run on all the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;odd numbered days&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &amp;quot;cross train&amp;quot; on all the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;even numbered days&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is exactly what I do.  So, right now, I run for ~55 min on odd days and swim for ~55 min (don&amp;#39;t judge) on even days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel fine and my heart rate stays in the correct band for my (advancing / M49) age.  Despite all of this my fitness tracker is chastising me continually for doing too much anaerobic cycles.  Perhaps it&amp;#39;s just an overly concerned AI.  But I feel I should check myself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is a monthly budget of 60 miles terrestrial and 30 miles aquatic too much?&lt;/p&gt;

**My diet:**  I aimed for 2500-3000 calories a day but that was never consistent. I  never tracked carbs or fat but with my dirty bulk mentality I was  definitely taking in enough. Only thing consistent in my diet was 6 eggs  each morning for breakfast and Peanut butter sandwiches for snacks and  I'd normally down a protein shake after gym. Eggs, peanut butter and  milk are absolute super foods for teenagers trying to bulk... cheap and  tasty. As a teen who doesn't have complete control over my diet due to  money, this was easily the hardest part of gaining.

**Routine for the first 5 months:**  Had no idea what the heck I was doing at first and pretty much only  trained arms and chest. Eventually I ran a bro split I made myself after  copying the types of exercises fellow gym bros were doing. This  actually gave me nice progress but I ended up over training and not  allowing my muscle groups to recover properly.

**Routine for the last 7 months:** I customized my own 3 day PPL as follows

**Push:**

Bench 5x5

Overhead press 4x8-12

Tricep push downs 4x12

Incline bench 4x6

Skull crushers 4x12

Lateral DB raise 4x12

Decline cable fly's 4x12

**Pull**

Pull ups 3x till failure

Chest supported rows 4x8-12

Hammer curls 4x12

Lat pull downs chin up grip 4x12

Bent over rows 4x6-8

Barbell curls 4x8-12

Face-pulls 4x12

**Legs:**

I  did both squats and dead lifts on leg day one after the other. One week  I'd do low rep range high weight and the next I'd do lower weight  higher rep range. 4x3-5 or 4x6-12

Leg extension/Leg curl superset 4x12 of each

Standing calf raises 3x15

Seated calf raises 3x15

**Main lifts progress**

Bench: 40kg-80kg

Squat:  Was scared of squats for the first few months so I stuck to leg press  but I would've guessed maybe 50kg? Currently at 85kg

Dead lift: 80kg-130kg

OHP: ???-45kg

My workouts are 2 hours long. Now before you ask, yes, this kind of intensity kicked my ass the first month I started working out. DOMS were over a week long, but once I powered through it I stopped feeling them and it's been smooth sailing ever since. I only had one deload week 3 months in but I didn't quite feel like I needed it that much.

---

Diet:

---

3500 kcal a day. My diet mostly consisted of the same stuff for the entire 6 months because I truly don't eat for enjoyment. I lift for a purpose (RIP Rich Piana) (and I guess because I'm way too lazy to cook, lol).

Greek Yoghurt

Oats

Fried Eggs

Cashews

Cheddar cheese

Rice / Buckwheat

Protein shakes (2x a day) that consist of banana, peanut butter, milk, chia seeds and mass gainer (half a serving).

---

Additional supplements: Creatine (3g). Pre-workout (350mg caffeine).

---

I know I still look like a DYEL skeleton compared to most of you but I'm quite happy with my noob gains so far. And for such a ""dirty"" bulk I didn't pack on as much fat as I thought I would.

Ever since I started lifting, I've been obsessed, so I'm going to keep on lifting until I reach the natty limit, whatever it takes. We're all gonna make it, brahs.

Now to reach 70kg until next year.

&lt;p&gt;From the official website, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You should give at least one month&amp;#39;s notice and provide evidence of lifting 300kg or more on any kind of lift&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this is a long term goal and I don&amp;#39;t really have a timeline that I am glued to. &lt;/p&gt;

So, I've recently learned the advantages of 'leaving one in the tank' and seen how it can positively impact my overall performance. 

Particularly, I recently realised I **haven't**  been applying this to my pullups. 

I've been pushing for max on all of my 4 sets. So for example, a typical day looks like:

8 Reps, 7 Reps, 6 Reps, 5 Reps 

But, I recently read some advice which recommends leaving myself with some energy. So for example, next week I will start by  trying to hit a consistent 6x4. Then maybe aim for 7, 7, 6, 6 etc and work my way up like so.

&lt;p&gt;However, my question is: Is there any reason to hold myself back on the final set? If I don&amp;#39;t intend to do any more back exercises that day, why wouldn&amp;#39;t I try and squeeze out as much as possible at the end of the workout?&lt;/p&gt;

To my limited knowledge about this, the main idea is to burn fat, become leaner, and also maintain or gain muscle all at the same time.

Can your body be in an anabolic and catabolic state at the same time? Is anabolic fasting scientifically proven to work or just another marketing scheme? I'd appreciate any references and studies as well.
