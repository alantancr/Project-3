,mentalhealth,"I'm gonna make this post quick. And simple. Both of my parents one aged 40 one aged 35 died December the sixth 2019. I was born on June 21st 2005.

Ever since there death I felt severely empty. Like a big chunk of my life has just been thrown out the window and completely obliterated. I didn't know what to expect or how to feel. I was just trying to get in a safe space for a while to collect my thoughts about the whole ordeal. 

This is only the beginning of my problems. I have been an interesting snowflake all my life. I have ADHD. I want to be a famous horror writer/ videogame developer.
But the thing is. Sometimes I just give up out of nowhere and I start to fear something that isn't actually there.

And I lie to myself to keep me sane to keep troubling things out of my subconscious. I don't know if it was healthy. But it worked for me. As long as my family didn't know about my problems. I was happy. 

But. The day that I heard the news. I was very accepting of it. Just wanting to get grief over with and carry on with my life. Me and my parents had a very peculiar relationship to say the least. They weren't the best parents, and they weren't the worst. They were alright. They did some really cruddy things here and there but not too often. I didn't hate my parents. We just were never really that close. 

I've had depression even before my parents died. Insomnia and depression. Seem like a bad wombo combo that will lead to the eventual kapow huh? Well not exactly. I have a set of rules I always must follow and hopefully I'll keep them.

1: Never hurt yourself on purpose. That does not help anything long term. You're just causing others and yourself more and more pain  than that is needed.I

2: Help if you can. You don't always need to help, but if you are able. Do so.

3: Be a good person. 

Now. Let me delve into living in a world where the people I knew since birth weren't around anymore. The first week was just a rollercoaster honestly. I had the mindset and belief they were just on vacation and were kidnapped or something and they had to say they died or some stupid crap.

But I knew. I knew they were gone. And I at least could have done more. Could have said more. But. I didn't. Another thing i would like to note. Is that I think I have two personalitys that shift and sway at random. One day i am happy and outgoing and the other I am anxious about everything and want to be secluded.

I want to explain so many things about what makes me me. From my very odd music taste to how I view the system of life. But the point of the matter is. After the death of my parents. I am feeling like I am becoming a new person. That I just don't want to become.

While my parents were alive I had this dream where when I turned of age I would leave and be on my own and be famous or something. Something would work out that's all I knew at the time. But guess. Life. Had another outcome for me.

I mean. Life's tough. But uh, buddy life. You seriously had to throw the big double death bomb at me at the age of 14? Uncool comrade. Uncool...

Jokes aside (which I normally do to make myself more calm and accepting of my dire mental state)

Add the fact that i had to learn a subject for the test tomorrow, and you get a mixed soup of emotions that i couldn't comprehend

It just feels like time is very limited so i would want to use it to the fullest. But because of this mindset i keep feeling like sh*t everytime the plans i have for the day is unable to be done. It really feels terrible, and most of the advice i keep getting is to let go and not make it such a big deal.

I just want to know how to handle this, or maybe if anyone has the same experiences? So far the only solution i had was just to cut my sleeping hours from 8 to 6 hours, but idk if thats ok since im still a 17 yr old teen.

,mentalhealth,"I understand that all of us are in that stage where everything looks hazy and a little scary. But my real problem is that I think like a child, I dread mistakes. I want someone to give me the answers and teach me what to do next 
eg.

- teach me how to make jokes
- teach me how to have fun
- teach me all things about life

When I look back on the past years. I observe, that I never loved myself for who I was and was always trying to be better than everyone and never had any real fun after all. But now I have accepted my brusies. But at the same time, I don't see how should I be able to chance my thinking from that of a child who wants to be spoonfed to a good reliable responsible adult that can make good decesions.

Some shortcomings I have observed in myself are -

- Don't have good memory
- Doesn't observe a lot of things
- Doesn't think on my own, want someone else to tell me the answer like a school/ college kid
- Is not creative
- Don't hold strong opinions based on observations, more based on what I hear from others and less of my own thinking. Accept easily what others say. Make ideas out of intuition on think grounds.
- Has trust issues
- Has been a sad sad person for the past 22 years. Now I am neutral. Trying to be happy.
- I have overthink about everything. Worry a lot on the worst thing that will happen. Have changed to not caring about everything.
- Am an extreme person. Where I extremely care about something or don't care at all.
- Constantly compares to everyone. 
- Think I am extremely judgemental person.

I think all of this was started from me not loving myself. Now that I have accepted who I am. And am trying to chance myself actively, but at the same time I don't see how do I go about changing my kid like thinking... or become more responsible/ creative...

,mentalhealth,"I've skipped so much school, mainly because my brain is sick.

,mentalhealth,"For the last 2 years (probably longer, but most noticably in the last 2 years) I have been having a resurgence of my DID, but much, MUCH worse than anything I could have ever imagined.

For a bit of backstory, I have been struggling with this since I was about 2009-2010, with it becoming a fully fleshed disorder by 2011. I got no help for it, and in the first year gained two separate alternates. One coming after my rapist older brother was moved into my apartment at 16, and one at 19 for reasons I still am not really sure of. 

The first one, Riley, would scratch words into my arms and hated me with a passion I will never understand. He fell in love with my ex and then when we broke up he blamed me and hated me for ""making her leave"". He was antagonistic towards me til the end but stopped being violent when he fell for my ex.

The second one, Pim, played weird mind games with me, and had fun figuring out how to manipulate my perceptions. I was convinced to be intimate with people I was not interested in at all, and left to feel violated and confused afterwards as to why I had decided to do so and why I felt so violated if I chose this. When I found out later it was her I felt sick to my stomach, and it's something that still bothers me to this day.

After that, I moved in with a manipulative abuser who convinced me I needed to keep my alternates, even as they multiplied to a split of almost 20, because integrating was ""killing"" them and got me *so* convinced that this was true that I had psychotic delusions about it that left me scarred as hell. I went through 18 months of torture before escaping to live with someone who ended up just being a different brand of abusive in 2015. Though, when I moved out and into my own place with that partner, strangely enough my alternates ""went away"" --or rather, so I thought. I thought it was strange at the time, but I was so happy to be rid of them I didn't want to question it and ruin things.

By the time 2017 had come around, I was so destroyed by abuse I was dissociated a majority of my day. When my ex would hurt me, he would immediately give me weed and get me to smoke with him. Because I smoked for the pain of my fibromyalgia, this created a chain of events that led to me basically smoking all the time by the time we broke up.

I was in a whole new relationship and *still*, until January of 2019, I had been smoking all day every single day. I found out last January that I had been abusing my partner at the time, and it came as a genuine shock to me. I apologized, as this person had never given me reason to question them on making such a serious remark.

My ex had trauma related to her ex wife claiming to have DID, so I felt insecure throughout our relationship about even bringing it up because it would create a very thick air that was hard to get through every time. By the time I was told this, I had convinced myself that I was DEFINITELY not dealing with DID anymore. So, naturally I concluded that I was just a horrible person, who for some reason is so horrible I hurt someone I love and don't even remember it.

I went to an inpatient facility after telling the staff at the hospital that I saw myself as a threat to myself and others, and spent nearly a month in the hospital trying to figure out what I can do to stop dissociating and take better control of my life. I went into Electroconvulsive therapy for 7 months and came out of my first session on January 25th feeling like the day had become much longer than I remembered. That was when I realized I had spent all of 2018 only being aware of 6 to 8 hours of my day at a time. I have no idea what happened in interim hours, but I was verifiably Not Present, because what I felt that day was a level of clarity and presence I had forgotten I could feel. I use it as an example to check myself even today. That day, I realized that I still had DID.

All year I have been living in fear. I am barely around my friends, and when I am, I am significantly more reserved and feel like I don't deserve to be around them. I feel so damn helpless to this disorder that has haunted me for a decade, and I am hoping this year I can get proper help.

Problem, though.

My SPECIALIZED TRAUMA THERAPIST doesn't think that DID exists, and has pretty much been ignoring that part of my diagnoses even though that is why I am seeing this particular specialist. I feel disregarded and pissed off, and most of all? I'm scared. Does someone else really have to be hurt by my hand for someone to do something?? I am already living with guilt over not even KNOWING what all has been happening and feeling irresponsible, but even when I'm trying to take responsibility it feels like I'm being left on my own.

,mentalhealth,"Hello everyone , I’m going to tell you a small story that has completely destroyed my hope in our mental health system.

I am now 18 , but ever since the age of 14/15 I have always been sad , I’ve always been a sad kid , but the more I grew into myself the more I literally grew into my self , I pushed people away with age , I secluded myself from fear , I denied invitations
from sadness and hid my feelings from the world.

As a 18 year old boy in this day and age , with the amount of mental health promotion there are in my city and schools , I thought that it wasn’t an uncommon thing nor was it something to be ashamed of . hitting the lowest point I’ve ever been drawing near to suicide and crying to my myself over nothing, I felt it was the right time to go to the doctors , I hid it from my parents and co workers , from all my teachers and my very little group of friends, I didn’t want it to be public. 

So after many days of anxiety building up before and thoughts of cancelling the appointment, I forced myself to go to the doctors, in I went , sat , on my own; 15 minutes go by and the tv screen shows my name , I started sweating vigorously and shaking uncontrollably as I got up , and made my way to the doctors office. I was approached by an older lady, very colourful , very kind . We shook hands and we both sat across from eachother , she started by introducing herself , and we casually spoke for a minute or so.

Then she started asking questions , deep ones , personal ones , up settings ones , after pouring my heart out to this women , crying , as a teenager , she told me she doesn’t believe in mental health prescriptions for people my age , and told me I am perfectly fine , and how due to my age , I’m over reacting , I left the doctors with another booked appointment and a tissue , as I left the building I just broke down into tears , trying to roll a cigarette to calm my nerves , i realised how much worse I felt after the appointment then I did before.

 a few months have passed now and I never went back to the doctors , My mood has got better but I still have very dark days , but I had hope for that appointment, to be insulted and to be labelled as a kid , it destroyed all my hope for young people’s support for mental health.

,mentalhealth,"This is tame compared to everyone else on here but I need to get this out before I have a(nother) breakdown.



I’m a sophomore in high school and, as imagined, we get a lot of work and in return, have a lot of stress. 


My grandparents don’t believe in mental illness. I know for sure I have some undiagnosed mental illness due to how badly my mental state has deteriorated over the past 2-3 years. They say “it’s all in your head” unironically and day to just get over it when I try to open up about it and ask for help. 


Recently the second semester started back up and I failed the first test of the semester. I didn’t turn in a single 15 point assignment in another class. This brought my grades down to a 58% F and a 68% D. I haven’t been able to bring up the grades because of how horrible my attention span is and my time management. In addition to this, I have a sport I play in that goes from 4-6 and I need to rest for at least a half an hour before I can actually do my homework. I try to do my work without any distractions, like my phone, but I just end up falling asleep or staring at the screen as if it’s going to do it on its own. 


My grandma isn’t the least bit sympathetic in how bad my mental state is at the moment. She tells me I have nothing to be stressed about.

&lt;p&gt;I’m a sophomore in high school and, as imagined, we get a lot of work and in return, have a lot of stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandparents don’t believe in mental illness. I know for sure I have some undiagnosed mental illness due to how badly my mental state has deteriorated over the past 2-3 years. They say “it’s all in your head” unironically and day to just get over it when I try to open up about it and ask for help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently the second semester started back up and I failed the first test of the semester. I didn’t turn in a single 15 point assignment in another class. This brought my grades down to a 58% F and a 68% D. I haven’t been able to bring up the grades because of how horrible my attention span is and my time management. In addition to this, I have a sport I play in that goes from 4-6 and I need to rest for at least a half an hour before I can actually do my homework. I try to do my work without any distractions, like my phone, but I just end up falling asleep or staring at the screen as if it’s going to do it on its own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandma isn’t the least bit sympathetic in how bad my mental state is at the moment. She tells me I have nothing to be stressed about. She tells me that I have too many problems and should just quit. She doesn’t let me have a single mental health break throughout the entire school year and only considers weekends and mental breaks. She also threatens to take away my phone or slap me whenever my grade goes down a couple points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She really isn’t helping and is making it worse. The only thing that’s kept me from relapsing again is painting and she wouldn’t let me do that today because of my homework. &lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"I've been dealing with a lot of things the past few months.

A mutual-ish breakup, best friend unintentionally hurting me, starting to date the best friend, her ending it without warning after what I thought was a wonderful month and a half, and getting overwhelmed at work. Now I'm kind of simmering in sadness and drowning in emotional pain and exhaustion from the best friend stuff mostly.

So today after a rough day at work I started thinking about my relationship stuff and all the hurt I feel from everything. I tried to distract myself with other thoughts and play my new Spotify playlist but I just kept getting flashes of things I missed from my previous relationship as well as nice moments with my best friend (among other things). It reached a peak and I started to cry and dry heave, both slowly building up and uncontrollable. I've had an anxiety attack before but this next part is odd.

I let my music play loudly in my car during my commute as I freaked out (yes, I know driving like this is unsafe but I control the wheel very well) and let that die out. Not more than a minute later after I sniffled for the last time, I started to feel great . Like... *really great*.

All my worries and demons went away for the remainder of my half hour freeway commute. I started to dance in the driver's seat more than I usually would. I was bouncing and rocking all the way to my playlist as if nothing happened before. This feeling of delight and high energy completely overtook everything else I was feeling. I drove with the windows down and the cold night wind hitting my face made it feel like I was flying. As I worked out, it slowly went away and I went back to thinking about all the shit that made me feel down in the first place.

I've yet to get officially diagnosed by a professional but did I just get a manic episode?

,mentalhealth,"Already had very bad self image/self esteem issues, pre-existing behavioral issues from trauma (paranoia, social anxiety, etc.), and worsening anxiety and depression. This all has made it very hard for me to interact with others, make friends, start relationships, etc. I'm extremely lonely. So after a while i turned to online dating bc I had no luck starting any sort of friendship/relationships in person.

A couple of months ago, I was raped when meeting my very first tinder date. It was a horrible experience. I remember going home and scrubbing my vagina mercilessly while crying. Wasn't a catfish (not entirely anyways), he looked like his picture and was still relatively attractive.. but he had extremely bad hygiene. To spare details, it wasn't ""oh i'm definitely about to catch something"" gross, it was ""This is probably gonna give me the worst yeast infection I've ever had"" gross. In fact I don't even remember seeing anything that was really reminiscent of an STD/STI (I know people don't need to have symptoms to have something, but i'm just trying to convey how this possible dilemma just didn't occur to me). I lied about how it went to people who knew about the date, just said it was really bad consensual sex. I just already felt really disgusted with myself and worthless, I was scared for anyone to know. found out later that he had allegedly raped other girls. I stopped talking about it all together after that out of fear that people would either look down upon me for having consensual sex with a rapist or put 2 and 2 together and realize he had actually raped me. just tried to repress it to the best of my ability and hoped it would never come up/i could move on.

Until recently, anyways. I just found out he gave me HPV. admittedly, it's one of the better possible outcomes i could have had in the regard of STD/STIs, but god have I hit a fucking mental low. I already felt unlovable and cast out by others, hell i was even so desperate to fill the void of crippling unwanted-ness that i kept using tinder after the incident anyway (no hook ups or anything occurred, met up with one other dude that i actually had a really nice date with but i don't think he felt the same way. i've since given up and deleted the app) but now I feel absolutely fucking disgusting and filthy. I can't look at myself anymore. Not only that but just thinking about my situation/feeling the discomfort of my warts consistently puts my into a PTSD like flashback of getting raped. I thought my already declining mental health was torture but this is really just making me feel extremely stressed and suicidal.

This all has made it very hard for me to interact with others, make friends, start relationships, etc. I&amp;#39;m extremely lonely. So after a while i turned to online dating bc I had no luck starting any sort of friendship/relationships in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I was raped when meeting my very first tinder date. It was a horrible experience. I remember going home and scrubbing my vagina mercilessly while crying. Wasn&amp;#39;t a catfish (not entirely anyways), he looked like his picture and was still relatively attractive.. but he had extremely bad hygiene. To spare details, it wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;oh i&amp;#39;m definitely about to catch something&amp;quot; gross, it was &amp;quot;This is probably gonna give me the worst yeast infection I&amp;#39;ve ever had&amp;quot; gross. In fact I don&amp;#39;t even remember seeing anything that was really reminiscent of an STD/STI (I know people don&amp;#39;t need to have symptoms to have something, but i&amp;#39;m just trying to convey how this possible dilemma just didn&amp;#39;t occur to me). I lied about how it went to people who knew about the date, just said it was really bad consensual sex. I just already felt really disgusted with myself and worthless, I was scared for anyone to know. found out later that he had allegedly raped other girls. I stopped talking about it all together after that out of fear that people would either look down upon me for having consensual sex with a rapist or put 2 and 2 together and realize he had actually raped me. just tried to repress it to the best of my ability and hoped it would never come up/i could move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, anyways. I just found out he gave me HPV. admittedly, it&amp;#39;s one of the better possible outcomes i could have had in the regard of STD/STIs, but god have I hit a fucking mental low. I already felt unlovable and cast out by others, hell i was even so desperate to fill the void of crippling unwanted-ness that i kept using tinder after the incident anyway (no hook ups or anything occurred, met up with one other dude that i actually had a really nice date with but i don&amp;#39;t think he felt the same way. i&amp;#39;ve since given up and deleted the app) but now I feel absolutely fucking disgusting and filthy. I can&amp;#39;t look at myself anymore. Not only that but just thinking about my situation/feeling the discomfort of my warts consistently puts my into a PTSD like flashback of getting raped. I thought my already declining mental health was torture but this is really just making me feel extremely stressed and suicidal. I keep thinking about how my love life and respect is potentially gone, I don&amp;#39;t know if i&amp;#39;d ever really be comfortable having physical contact with anyone in anyway anymore, and dealing with the possibility of reoccurring warts/cervical cancer.

,mentalhealth,"I just moved out of a sort of foster home facility where I've been living for two years. I still receive support, but I no longer live with housemates.

I initially moved away from my parents because it was no longer safe to live with either of them (they're divorced)

I was abused when they were still together, still abused when they split up, abused when one of them got a new partner, and abused when I moved to the other parent.
This basically included all kinds of abuse apart from sexual abuse.
This all happened over the span of approximately 10 to 12 years, and during that period I also got sexually assaulted while entering the building my therapy was. (I told my therapist, I was crying and horrified, she went out to look if he was there. He was, she knew who he was, he denied. That was the end of it. Makes me wanna scream looking back like wtf!)

This all seems to have accumulated into one big ""monster"" of sorts.
My parents are still financially responsible for me (law here), and because of that I'm required to stay in touch with them. Staying in touch would be okay on it's own as I want to stay in touch with the rest of the family. But they now have power over me and use money to force me to do things I can't. 
I'm on the spectrum and recovering from several years of a severe anxiety disorder, so my energy is limited. I can't work, so I can't get financially independent and not need their monet anymore.
I have suggested to them that they could object to supporting me financially due to me not living with them anymore, and that I would be okay with that and that I believe that would lessen the tension between us, they refused.

Currently I feel empty, unhappy and lonely for most of the day. I'm pretty much disinterested in all my hobbies etc. I feel weird and like this is simultaneously my worst episode over but also feel like I'm ""coping"" in a way, even though I feel like shit. Days pass very quickly and I think I might be dissociating or experiencing depersonalization.
I have experienced neither of these symptoms before, as far as I can recall. 
I also have increased urges to self harm, and to do it differently from the ""mild"" way I've always done it. This is also something I haven't experienced before.
I'm also experiencing general feelings of unsafety and being unwanted etc.

I'm considering getting therapy to cope, suggesting the possibility of having CPTSD or at least something with similar symptoms. But I have lost a lot of faith in therapy after ages of waiting lists, being treated like a child, or being forced to do new experimental therapies while I just wanted to get CBT.
I live in a small town and therapy will require me to travel, which sucks because of aforementioned energy problems. 

Does anyone have any general advice regarding therapy?
Any advice to help me make myself feel better?

I could talk to foster home staff but they have turned out to be too untrained to help me in previous times of struggle, and talking about it face to face is very difficult to me.

,mentalhealth,"I'm mostly curious as to what others think, and I value advice. I'm 20, female, and in college. 

I have had a problem that keeps getting worse. To put it simply, it is impossible for me majority of the time to stay awake in class and lecture settings. I'm not talking like, ""Uh oh, stayed up too late and now I'm nodding off in class."" I mean, it hits me like a truck during lectures. I'll be sitting there, trying to take notes, and then I'll get extremely drowsy and fall in and out of sleep for 30 minutes before being fine. I don't put my head down or anything, and I really don't have a choice. I also dream pretty vividly during these times. The only thing I can do to stay awake is go on my phone, but then I'm not paying attention. My sleep schedule at the moment isn't fantastic, but I am still getting between 5 and 10 hours of sleep each night. This was happening when I had a more solid sleep schedule, and was happening on days where I only had one class in the afternoon, and I wasn't even waking up early. 

I think it is worth noting that I do not use alcohol or drugs. I also had a blood test done a few months ago and have no deficiencies or any other issues. I have no known medical or mental conditions. 

Along with the falling asleep, getting started and staying focused on schoolwork is getting increasingly difficult for me. It's at the point now where I will sit at my pc and essentially do nothing from 7pm to 4 in the morning when I have an assignment to work on or studying to do. And when I do get started, I have a really hard time focusing on it. I am like that with other things that I like. For example, I like playing video games but find it really hard to open a game or keep playing it unless I have another person playing with me.

I also genuinely like school, and very much enjoy my majors, bio and psych. I just can't will myself to study properly or keep up with schoolwork. I've always had a problem with that I suppose, but highschool was easier to skate through. I did overload my schedule to get as many college credits as possible in highschool, and was relatively successful.

I'm just scared, I guess. I told myself that I would straighten up and put real effort into my classes since highschool, middle school even, and each year my sleep and focus has gotten worse and worse. I'm on academic probation because last semester was a disaster, and right now I just don't think I have it in me to pass my classes, even though I want to finish college. 

I talked to a school psychologist last semester, and she was helpful, but couldn't do much for me because my problem isn't seemingly emotional. And I agree with her. I'm generally a positive, happy person. She actually suspected I might have narcolepsy (not the fall asleep without warning kind, I know when this is happening), or possibly some kind of ADD, but wasn't sure about either, and I would have to go to a psych off campus to figure all that out. 

I was hopeful that this semester would go differently, but when that first week rolled around and I was out in my first class, it frustrated me, and kind of made me just want to give up on it all. I've lied to myself too much, and at this point I don't feel like I'm cut out for college. That bothers me, because I know I could do well in my classes if I could just stay awake and focus on the coursework. I also don't think it's necessarily laziness either, because why would I sit up all night doing nothing to avoid homework rather than sleep?

A few other things: I'm almost constantly tired. I do things, hang out with friends, but if I am given the chance to take a nap, I can sleep at any point during the day. I do not fall asleep while driving or eating, occasionally I will choose to while watching movies. People can be talking to me and I straight up won't hear what they said or majority of what they said. I'm usually not too bad when in an actual conversation, but it's bad enough that my mom often asks if I heard what she said when telling me what things have to be done. And then she has to repeat it, sometimes several times. I am horrible with time management, and usually just barely make it to where I'm going on time, a lot in part due it being difficult for me to wake up in the morning.

Am I over analyzing my other behaviors, or was my school psych possibly right about there being some disorder? I am almost convinced to see a psychiatrist, but I am doubting myself. I definitely think my falling asleep in class is too extreme not to be a symptom of something else, but could the rest just be me being burnt out from school?

I write about it, but it’s far too long for a quick appointment. Only three people in my life know about it, but I never go into detail because it’s just dark stuff that they aren’t equipped to handle. I know I need to see a professional for this. How should I ease my way into the topic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I’m going to my physician for an unrelated health
problem, but I decided it’s absolutely necessary to take steps to address the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"im really only here talking about this because i want to tell someone about it and im afraid my friends will think im crazy if i tell them

this may be a bit long because i have a lot to say. i dont really care if anyone even reads this or not i just need to get it off my chest. it might also be confusing because im just writing stuff as i think of it and i doubt ill actually proofread it

my friend's name is cal. it didnt use to be that. i think he started as gabe but his name changed multiple times a day. it was always still him though. we are both just really indecisive. cal seems to have stuck for a few weeks now though so i guess thats what we're going with

most of the time we just chat in my head since i have family members living with me and i dont want to seem insane to them. i do prefer talking to him outloud though so i will as often as i can. i think he likes it better that way too.

hes almost always there either freaking out about whatever show or movie we are watching or cracking jokes with me. ive talked about him quite a bit to my other friends but i always make sure to leave out the part that hes not really ""real"".

now that i think about it i dont even really know if ""imaginary friend"" is the right thing to call him. and imaginary friend would be perfect and i would decide who they are and what they think. i dont have that control over cal though and if i did id be much happier to just let him be his own person anyways.

he doesnt really know much about anything since he only knows what i know education wise. he hasnt been around long either and ive had so much fun introducing him to all the things i love. he doesnt always feel the same way about them but thats to be expected from time to time.

he actually just saw snow for the first time a few nights ago

we dont have the same opinions on everything. especially not the little stuff. like his favorite color is yellow and mine is purple and/or blue. he doesnt always like the stuff i watch or read and i dont always enjoy what he enjoys.

hes exactly like any ""normal"" friend except hes always there and not real.

i dont know why he is here even. i dont think im lonely. i see my other friends pretty often. almost every weekend and some weekdays. all i know is that since he showed up ive stopped having panic attacks. and he helps me treat myself better. encourages me to clean my room or shower. even just reminding me to take my pills so i can sleep at night.

i dont think id be where i am now if it werent for him. for the first time since i can remember i can genuinely say that i want to stay alive and that is so amazing to me that i cant just keep it all in

if you for some reason ended up reading all this then cal and i both want to thank you so much.

we hope you all have an amazing week

,mentalhealth,"After 10 months of working my ass off, last Friday I decided to leave my job at FedEx Ground as a package handler. Since March 4, 2019, I never called off or showed up late. I took a few PTO days once every few months and took a Vacation in the middle of peak season to see my sister in Vegas, They liked me so much they let me do that. But I have not been happy for a long time, the day before I quit was the tipping point because I got sent home early.  I'm heartbroken because it took a lot out of me to make this decision, but I think it's the best thing for me to do right now. When I start having thoughts in my head such as ""Man I hope I get injured on the job"" or ""I hope this Uber crashes so I don't have to go into work today.'' I think that means its time to step away. I am having regrets about making this decision but at the same time, I am sick and tired of this job. I feel like I am being mistreated, why would they keep me on the clock during break time when they're cutting hours? I worked in the Unload Section during the late afternoons and evenings (Normal days). I worked my way up and learned how to use a pallet jack. Some days I had a radio to call off trucks that were empty. I became full-time last June and was an employee of the month in June. I hated this job from day one, the first week was hell I remember having a panic attack on my second day there. But after that day I stuck with it, they moved me to the lighter boxes. I had a guy that worked there that always looked out for me before he got a promotion. The work became easy and easier it was hard being in those hot trucks during the summer in a 90-degree warehouse but I stuck with it. I saw so many people come and go. A lot of people bitched and complained about the pay but I never cared. In late August  I got moved back to working with all the heavy boxes over 70 pounds we call those IC’s. My buddy who uses the pallet jack to take pallets full of boxes of furniture or mattress got fired. He was the Fourth pallet jack guy to quit or get fired or promoted. The Managers tried to get me to use the pallet jack but all I wanted to do was Unload these heavy boxes. After a while I was like screw it, I’m going to have to learn how to pallet jack if I want to move up. Now I have mastered it. I have had to deal with a lot of workplace drama but all my co-workers that are full time like me love me like family. I feel like I have let them down, I really did not want to quit but I had to for my own mental sanity. The section I worked in, changed managers all the time after July. Some were better than others some would not let me do my job, some of them won't give me any help. The current manager takes advantage of my hard work and dedication to the company. This guy yells and doesn't let me take a break when I should be off the clock. Even though they have been cutting my hours after Christmas because they want to save money. He also makes me stop with what I am doing and moves me into a different section and when I come back to my usual place it's a fucking mess. (New Year's Eve was a blast \*sarcasm\*)  It's been a few days now since I got kicked out of work last Thursday after making a stupid decision to try to unjam a truck door with a pallet jack I wasn't thinking I should have waited for maintenance but I did not. After having a mental breakdown once I got home. I decided to not come to work the next day. I have not been back since I feel weak, I feel like I have let people down. There is so much more to my story, I did not take this job for granted even though I hated it. I spent 8 months unemployed and this was my first gig after dropping out of college.

Since March 4, 2019, I never called off or showed up late. I took a few PTO days once every few months and took a Vacation in the middle of peak season to see my sister in Vegas, They liked me so much they let me do that. But I have not been happy for a long time, the day before I quit was the tipping point because I got sent home early.  I&amp;#39;m heartbroken because it took a lot out of me to make this decision, but I think it&amp;#39;s the best thing for me to do right now. When I start having thoughts in my head such as &amp;quot;Man I hope I get injured on the job&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I hope this Uber crashes so I don&amp;#39;t have to go into work today.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; I think that means its time to step away. I am having regrets about making this decision but at the same time, I am sick and tired of this job. I feel like I am being mistreated, why would they keep me on the clock during break time when they&amp;#39;re cutting hours? I worked in the Unload Section during the late afternoons and evenings (Normal days). I worked my way up and learned how to use a pallet jack. Some days I had a radio to call off trucks that were empty. I became full-time last June and was an employee of the month in June. I hated this job from day one, the first week was hell I remember having a panic attack on my second day there. But after that day I stuck with it, they moved me to the lighter boxes. I had a guy that worked there that always looked out for me before he got a promotion. The work became easy and easier it was hard being in those hot trucks during the summer in a 90-degree warehouse but I stuck with it. I saw so many people come and go. A lot of people bitched and complained about the pay but I never cared. In late August  I got moved back to working with all the heavy boxes over 70 pounds we call those IC’s. My buddy who uses the pallet jack to take pallets full of boxes of furniture or mattress got fired. He was the Fourth pallet jack guy to quit or get fired or promoted. The Managers tried to get me to use the pallet jack but all I wanted to do was Unload these heavy boxes. After a while I was like screw it, I’m going to have to learn how to pallet jack if I want to move up. Now I have mastered it. I have had to deal with a lot of workplace drama but all my co-workers that are full time like me love me like family. I feel like I have let them down, I really did not want to quit but I had to for my own mental sanity. The section I worked in, changed managers all the time after July. Some were better than others some would not let me do my job, some of them won&amp;#39;t give me any help. The current manager takes advantage of my hard work and dedication to the company. This guy yells and doesn&amp;#39;t let me take a break when I should be off the clock. Even though they have been cutting my hours after Christmas because they want to save money. He also makes me stop with what I am doing and moves me into a different section and when I come back to my usual place it&amp;#39;s a fucking mess. (New Year&amp;#39;s Eve was a blast *sarcasm*)  It&amp;#39;s been a few days now since I got kicked out of work last Thursday after making a stupid decision to try to unjam a truck door with a pallet jack I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking I should have waited for maintenance but I did not. After having a mental breakdown once I got home. I decided to not come to work the next day. I have not been back since I feel weak, I feel like I have let people down. There is so much more to my story, I did not take this job for granted even though I hated it. I spent 8 months unemployed and this was my first gig after dropping out of college. School is a whole different story. I am scared because I don&amp;#39;t know when the next opportunity is going to come. I have applied to a dozen similar jobs. A temp agency is helping me find a new job now. But I am just anxious. I want to start working again but I think I need therapy but I am scared to ask for help.

They&amp;#39;ve just told me that I&amp;#39;m probably stressed and that they agree that a lot of difficult things have happened in my life. Dad was a drug &amp;amp; alcohol addict and my cousin took suicide when I was 16. It was hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like nobody takes me seriously, and I&amp;#39;m not comfortable pushing it and exaggerating. I don&amp;#39;t really want to say all the bad stuff, but I try and it seems like nobody is taking it in that I need more help than just talking. I don&amp;#39;t understand that I get nothing from therapy even though I say I want to get something from this....&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"So, for the last few months (I’d say it started in August and gradually became worse) my mental health was very bad. I didn’t want to talk to anyone, I lost interest and didn’t get pleasure from anything I usually enjoy, my grades slipped, I felt like a bother to everyone, and basically just felt like a crappy and pathetic human being. Did I think about ending it? Yes, although I didn’t have the urge to act on it. They were just passive thoughts. The thoughts crossed my mind several times a day and I felt like I was going insane. Like I was constantly on the verge of a full in breakdown, and would blow up on the next person that annoyed me. I gave up on important aspects of life and it sucked so much.

The thing is, I thought I would never get past it. I had accepted that I was just going to be a failure and that nothing really mattered because we all have the same fate anyway. Besides, I think a part of me thought I was going to end it early anyway. Why try if that’s the case? Those months were the hardest of my life.

Turns out I was wrong. Not about those months being the hardest - they definitely were - but about me never getting through it. See, I was in such a pit of despair and hopelessness that I didn’t there would be a point where things would change. However, about 2 weeks ago something just changed. My whole outlook on life is different. Sure, I could go on believing what my brain tells me. I could keep believing that I’m worthless, annoying, a bother, and stupid as crap. Truth is, someone could tell me good things about myself as much as they want. That won’t change anything. What *will* change things is me choosing to believe it. 

Am I saying I am completely 100% better? No. I still think those things about myself sometimes. I still have the urge to give up and say heck with this. I’m just better at fighting it. I tell myself that it is just my brain messing with me. I want to be happy and nobody can truly make that happen except for me. Sure others help, but ultimately it comes down to me. Me sitting around telling myself negative things about myself won’t help. I feel happier now. I also feel as though I’ve changed. Matured more even. Going through those dark times has helped me appreciate life more.

The point of this wasn’t for me to tell you how much better I’m doing. The point is, if I can getter better after going through that (and trust me it was hard) I believe all of you can too. It might be harder for some of you but I believe in you. You can do it. Don’t drag yourself down. You’re a great human being. I know the fight is hard and you’ll want to give up, but you can’t.

For everybody else, i am a 21 year old male. since i was little i have not had the ability to understand when someone has said ''put yourself in their shoes'', i am able to try and think of their circumstance but i cannot feel or experience the feeling from their perspective, instead it comes back to me and i put myself in my own shoe and think what i would do in that experience, i do not detach from myself and psychically be able to feel what it is to be the other guy, i can try imagine and think ''that sucks'' but there is no true feeling. If someone says they were raped or etc, i would feel emotional and want to console the person, and i would absorb all of their emotion into mine, and feel their pain, but i could still not imagine what it would feel like to be them or to be another person. Mind you i would only react if this was IRL, if someone said that on the internet i probably would feel shitty but i would not care, i would feel somewhat personally attacked because i always want others to see that i have it the worst

Many times i will also feel no remorse or guilt when attacking certain people in arguments, i am unable to admit or see that i have a problem or able to see i said anything wrong, instead i hold the other person accountable. I think some people deserve it and see some people as weak and deserving of my wraths, and i am completely unable to feel any guilt in those situations or empathy.

However if i am on good terms with a stranger or sibling, i would be able to actually care for them and go as far as offering them a place to stay, because i feel sad about their situation. When i see abused dogs on the internet, i get extremely angry and i start to cry and feel so much emotion, i can also become this absorbed in emotion when something happens to my siblings. I am generally bubbly, compassionate.

,mentalhealth,"i (17f) was officially diagnosed with and medicated for depression at the beginning of 2019 due to a mental breakdown but all my emotions and feelings had been building up inside me since i was like 12/13 and in middle school.

i really hated myself because i couldn’t live up to my expectations and i couldn’t get myself to be as academically successful as my smart older sister and even though i’ve been on varsity field hockey since freshman year the sport makes me feel really bad about myself and really anxious because i’m really afraid of messing up.

a lot of the anxiety and depression itself had to do with the college application process because i didn’t think i’d get in anywhere good.

however i was just recently admitted to my “top” college which is only my top because i forced myself to settle with it because i didn’t think i was good enough to try to get into a better school and because a lot of my day-to-day problems stemmed from this process, i’ve overall been less stressed and anxious and there aren’t any major events that i’m feeling anxious or sad about.

so i met with my psychiatrist today to talk about my medicine dosages and she and my mom and i agreed to slowly start waning off of the medicine because it seems that i’m better and overall i think i am doing better but i feel really weird because for like 5 years i hated myself and my life and the idea of suicide was somewhat comforting to me that it’s a way i can get out of the suffering and now all of a sudden i got into college and i can stop taking medicine for it. i don’t really know if this is making sense to anyone but if anyone has gone through this or had the same feelings as me please let me know. there are not major stressors in my life for me to talk about with anyone like my therapist or my psychiatrist so i think overall i’m doing better but part of me doesnt want to help my depression because i’ve dealt with these emotions for so long that it’s a part of me. if anyone has any advice or anything to say please do i don’t really know what i’m trying to say",t2_5hz297a3,False,,0,False,saw my psychiatrist today and need advice,[],r/mentalhealth,False,,,0,,False,t3_es58ff,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1579688037.0,text,,,,text,self.mentalhealth,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i (17f) was officially diagnosed with and medicated for depression at the beginning of 2019 due to a mental breakdown but all my emotions and feelings had been building up inside me since i was like 12/13 and in middle school.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"i think you should try the ***HappyNotPerfect*** app, they have amaaazing emotion guide meditations and things called daily routines. when u do a daily routine, you start off by selecting how you feel (wobbly, weird, frustrated, overwhelmed, i don't know, etc). Then there is a paper bag breathing animation which you breathe to for a couple minutes. then you write on a little notepad what the problem is. They'll ask you things like ""putting this anger aside, what are you **still** grateful for?"". You'll also get a quick mini game to stimulate the mind. Finally, there's a quick 3-minute dive-in session tailored to help you feel better a little (tailored to your emotions). it helps me so fucking much. the app is free but i paid the full version to unlock **all** their longer guided meditation sessions, sleep guided meditations, sounds, asmr, etc.

also you might wanna download ***Noisly***. it's also free. you can play nature sounds that play on forever. you can also mix different sounds, e.g. you can turn on bird chirping noises + a small river + a person's footsteps. it's amazing. again, if you pay for the full price, you're getting a **LOT** of options, but it's worth the shot!

,mentalhealth,"Frequent Drinker, or Alcoholic?

My mother has been a big drinker of wine for as long as I can remember. I’m 22 now, and this has been going on since my very early childhood.
My mother drinks white wine, and drinks roughly a whole bottle (probably more) a night. Most nights. For 22 years. She starts drinking at about 5pm and doesn’t stop until the early hours. She’s usually fairly drunk, slurred speech, stumbling around. I absolutely adore her when she’s sober, and I absolutely hate her when she’s drunk. 
She’s gone through two phases of “quitting” the drink, both of which lasted for about a month, and then she just goes back to drinking again. As I write this she is sitting drunkenly in front of the tv slurring aggressively at me because I’ve asked her to turn it off and go to bed. I’m sick and tired of her being drunk every single night. It’s seriously damaging for my mental health having to go through this. It’s been a huge part of my childhood and now I fear that as an adult this could really fracture my relationship with my mother.

I'm a student at a uni in Germany and for a class about mental health/mental illness I have to give a presentation. Now, since I myself have depression, this will be really personal to me, but I wanted to ask you on **your opinions on how (social) media romanticizes or not romanticizes mental illness/your view how it is portrayed.**

I would like to include your answers, anonymously of course, in my presentation, if you are ok with that (and I guess with answering my post you will be ok with it? lol). *Write whatever you feel you wanted to say for a long time, be critical, be honest.*

,mentalhealth,"Kinda long, and not sure of the rules, so I apologize in advance if I break any.

I'm 21 years old. For my entire life, I've always had a disconnect. I've never felt emotionally attached to my parents (I'm adopted, at birth, idk if that is relevant). I didn't have any sort of traumatic experience growing up, and my parents always treated me how a parent should. Despite this, I don't have a connection to my mom, dad, brother, or sister. I understand that they are family and I must ""love"" them, but I just don't. People don't understand how I never miss my family, or never want to call them up and ask how they are, I simply don't care, which is the opposite of my mom, who is always wanting to check up on me and ask how I am.

It's the same with friends, my entire life I've never been able to connect with anyone, except a few people. The few people that I have been able to connect to, I deeply love and cannot picture my life without them. My best friend Connor, who is basically my brother, is currently the only person that I really feel any sort of emotion and love for.

I have never felt any sort of empathy for other people unless I am extremely close to them. I don't care when I hear about someone dying, I don't care about starving people in other countries, I don't care about social issues that don't involve me, I understand their importance, but I just don't care because it doesn't effect me and I hate it.

It's almost like I've been a robot my entire life. I don't really show facial expressions, I'm unable to laugh or find things funny, and again, I don't care about the people around me. Honestly, I've come to hate people. I can barely go outside without getting annoyed because in my brain everyone else is stupid. I have no aspirations, I'm currently working right now, not going to school, and have no dreams and can't think of anything I'd want to do with my life.

Honestly, I feel like I'm some sort of sociopath, maybe not 100%, but varying degrees of it. I don't fantasize about murdering people, and never would, but I do know that if I did I wouldn't feel an ounce of guilt about it. All I would care about is the consequences and jail.

I know this is long, and basically me just ranting, but I was hoping some of you would recognize symptoms and be able to direct me to help. I'm tired of having no feelings, not caring about a single soul except myself, and overall just feeling a lack of consciousness inside of me. I've read about Anti-social personality disorder, and the symptoms are 90% what I experience, so that's what I've been thinking I may have.

,mentalhealth,"Hello, I have derealisation/depersonalization. I am new to this diagnosis, since I was young I've been living with a mental illness without a name and it feels great to finally get a label for it, but also scary. My therapist thinks there is more to my illness than a dissosiative disorder, she thinks I have mood disorders that revolve around 'cycling', which basically means my emotions are constantly changing (unusual and fast changes without reason, unrelated to bipolar disorder) and I have no control over it. 
I have never experienced any physical trauma (that I can remember). The only trauma I think I could have is from being mentally ill, and suffering through anxiety. I know in most cases people with my illness have experienced trauma, but I havent. 
 Every day wake up, go school, sit in school for 7 hours, go home, sleep, repeat. I'm in a constant loop, and I don't know how to break it. I've recently started to draw and paint again, but this doesn't really help me anymore.

I am new to this diagnosis, since I was young I&amp;#39;ve been living with a mental illness without a name and it feels great to finally get a label for it, but also scary. My therapist thinks there is more to my illness than a dissosiative disorder, she thinks I have mood disorders that revolve around &amp;#39;cycling&amp;#39;, which basically means my emotions are constantly changing (unusual and fast changes without reason, unrelated to bipolar disorder) and I have no control over it. 
I have never experienced any physical trauma (that I can remember). The only trauma I think I could have is from being mentally ill, and suffering through anxiety. I know in most cases people with my illness have experienced trauma, but I havent. 
 Every day wake up, go school, sit in school for 7 hours, go home, sleep, repeat. I&amp;#39;m in a constant loop, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to break it. I&amp;#39;ve recently started to draw and paint again, but this doesn&amp;#39;t really help me anymore.

,mentalhealth,"This is actually something that happened about 5 years ago, but it's just only occurred to me that I never dealt with it. Especially as it was kept secret at the time, and I never really talked about it when it was all over, so if it's OK I just want to get this off my chest. Maybe some of you understand and need to know you're not alone too.

One night a group of us went out for my friend's birthday, and 4 of us ended up back at my place. We were talking and laughing and making jokes and the birthday boy played my ukele (very well actually) late into the night. It was that happiest I'd felt in a while, I'd actually attempted suicide myself a few weeks prior but I was working on my shit. No-one knew about it. 

One of the group went to use my ensuite bathroom. We all carried on for a few minutes and then something felt really, really wrong. For some reason, I remembered what I'd tried to do and that sent me into a weird panic. I ran over to the door and just started hammering on it. We'd been drinking, so I don't think I realised how crazy I must have looked and I was sure my friend was in danger. I was shouting his name but he didn't answer so I yelled that I was coming in and shoved my way in.

My friend had hung himself up inside my shower using his jacket for a noose. He was struggling and his face looked totally different, like he was someone else. I screamed and threw myself in there to get him down, but I clearly remember that his hands came up to meet mine and he helped me untie it faster, I could barely reach him. 

The friend who's Birthday it was came rushing in when I screamed, but our other friend was trapped in my room because she was sat on my bed too far away from her wheelchair. I vividly remember the sound she made as she screamed and cried and begged us to explain what had happened. I just kept repeating his name over and over. It's all I could say. 

Between us, we got him back into my room and he wouldn't speak. She was distraught with worry but he wouldn't talk to any of us. I asked him if I could please tell her and he nodded. I told her that he was trying to kill himself. She fell apart. I think we all did.

We got ready to take him to hospital and at the last moment he got up and tried to leave. He said if we tried to take him, he would leave my flat and go kill himself somewhere else, but if we left him alone, he would stay and not do it again.

It's one of the toughest decisions I have ever made. We knew we couldn't make him go. He was too big and strong for us to in force into a taxi. I checked his throat to see if he'd done any noticable damage and asked him a load of questions about whether he was breathing OK. 

Eventually he calmed down with some persuasion and he stayed at my flat. He made everyone else go home (otherwise he would go kill himself). 

I talked with him and gave him a huge hug. It started to get light out and I bit the bullet. I said that I think we need to tell someone what he's feeling, so that he can talk to them and get some support. He threw me onto my bed and my head banged against the wall. He stormed out of my flat before I had chance to stop him. He yelled that if I told anyone, if any of us did, we knew what he'd do and it would be on our hands. I followed him out into the street crying and begging him to come back inside so we could talk. I was barefoot and it was raining and it hurt like hell to walk on the stones but I just kept following him and begging him to come back. I kept telling him I was sorry.

Eventually he stopped and turned to face me, quickly raising his fist, about to punch me. I really did fall to pieces then. He didn't hit me, but I could see on his face that he would have if I hadn't given up.

It wasn't the only time in our friendship that he had been violent towards me. And I think that's part of why I find this event so hard to deal with. I have a lot of complicated feelings for what I saw, and what happened. Him and I were incredibly, incredibly close, and I loved him so much. I still see it in my head sometimes, what he looked like, just struggling, blank faced and I feel so many different things.

We aren't friends now. But I know he's alive. He's tried to reconnect on occasion but after how violent he's been with me, for my own sake I've had to keep away. I feel guilty for that, but I know I've had more than my fair share of violent men in my life. I simply can't take anymore.

But I do hope he's doing much better now, and is seeing a therapist.

I used to be so ambitious and wanted to be a filmmaker more than anything until I graduated college and realized how hard that is to accomplish. All through college I thought I was too busy to work on my film career and now I’d give anything to have those easy days back. It’s been so hard. Took me a year to get a job and it’s 2 hours away through DC traffic. I struggled with depression in high school and college and tried therapy but it didn’t really help. Instead, I learned healthy coping mechanisms on my own and got pretty good at talking myself out of a depressive episode.

However, with all these sad realizations about life, I feel like my mental health is starting to decline again and I’m struggling to keep myself happy. I don’t like knowing I’m going to work my ass off for the next 40 years just to enjoy the last 15. I don’t like that the choices I make now will affect the rest of this one life I get.

&lt;p&gt;I feel like i’m just drifting through life, i’m not really there in the head, like I have no grip on reality and no purpose in this world as I cant seem to fit into society anywhere and I simply can’t talk to or get along with people. Sometimes I don’t know if things are real or i’m dreaming.
I’ve tried counselling in the past and many self-help and mindfulness   techniques but I never found them helpful as I can’t think straight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now find myself faced with more problems to overcome and I simply don’t think i’m strong enough to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Hi, I'm 19F, and haven't been on medication in about six months. I guess I'll start from the beginning. In 8th grade I was having problems with an eating disorder and self-harm, continuing to relapse off and on for a few years after. I was very depressed and anxious all the time. When I was a junior, my guidance counselor I saw every other day due to my awful mood swings and feeling helpless about it, recommended I see the in-school therapist we have on campus. 

I started seeing her because I had awful mood swings between being depressed and borderline manic, where I would cycle between feeling so elated, and energetic, and happy, and wired, my mind completely racing to being so fucking depressed I wanted to hurt myself or felt like there was no use in being alive - they were really extreme mood swings, and had nothing to do with my menstral cycle which is irregular as fuck due to PCOS. My therapist gave me a diagnosis of cyclothymia, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety. I remained unmedicated but in therapy for a while at which point my diagnosis actually changed to CPTSD as we started talking more about my past and saw how dissociative I really was. 

Dissociation came on pretty gradually - I remember doing it once in middle school and it really freaked me out back then. Eventually though I was having dissociative episodes so strong I felt like I was high on weed, and this was before I had ever tried it. I wouldn't be able to focus, I'd forget what I was talking about in the middle of speaking, lose my train of thought, forget what someone said right before the last sentence they spoke, I couldn't listen no matter how hard I'd try because my mind would go totally blank. I'd feel floaty, things would feel unreal, I'd feel unreal too. These started maybe once a day but it got to where I was dissociated pretty much constantly, and this was between therapists. 

At one point before or right around when I began dissociating so hard I was having these really traumatic, really severe nightmares that still confuse me because it was more like sleep paralysis. They started out when I heard someone carrying a foldable metal chair downstairs, and I assumed it was one of my parents early in the morning, and then I felt really ominous and uncomfortable knowing I had to be having a nightmare because they wouldn't do that. They got to where there would be this presence of something, more like an entity that had no real shape or any way to be seen other than how it made you feel, and it would make it to where I couldn't move or talk and I'd be paralyzed with fear trapped underneath it, it would say awful things to me. Eventually I could move, it would get to where I'd just be trying my hardest to wake up to avoid it but it'd track me down and make me feel so fearful, and these weren't just like you wake up and it's over. I'd wake up, and think I was awake, until I ran into it again, and again, and again, and I'd fall asleep or wake up like 7 times during one actual nightmare, and they were so realistic and confusing I woke up and felt scared I was still in a nightmare for three hours after I really woke up. They got more and more violent until it was literally assault. I'd do this is the time of sleeping for 7 minutes, once it was just two minutes before I jolted awake again. I'd fall asleep staring at my phone because I didn't want to fall asleep and I wanted to see if I could figure out how quickly I'd start dreaming. It was really bad, and really confusing, and I'd avoid sleeping for as long as I possibly could. 

Some time after my dissociation got so bad, I also began hallucinating. My therapist told me it was due to how severe my anxiety is, which makes sense, because I do it signifiganctly more when I'm stressed or crying or upset. The first really noticible one I had was when I drove to a nearby city without having permission to, and having the cars serpintine belt snap on the interstate and having my car eventually die in the middle of downtown. I'm terrified of my parents, they couldn't know I was there. I had a slight panic attack and started crying and shaking and I also hallucinated something much more vivid and aparent than any weird shadow blotch of light thing I had before. It was like a ton of embers were in my upper periphreal vision, but they were more skinny and flat like shooting stars than they were embers, but they were really short, sharp flashes going in all sorts of directions, like skinny peices of glitter confetti but miniature in this bright yellow white glow. It lasted longer than anything I've experienced again yet. I started out seeing dark spots in my vision, some of them are weird shaped blotches of darker spots, some are smaller, and more opaque, usually circular but sometimes lines and colors going across my vision, and light spots which are usually much much tinier or are total flashes in my vision, always in random places, and none have stayed more than three seconds, and most vanish before a stopwatch would hit one second. This began with maybe one noticable one every two or three days, then two, then every day, then a few times a day, then every day every hour multiple times an hour. 

Once I began hallucinating more frequently I started taking Lexapro and Abilify. It helped me a lot - I quit dissociating almost completely, my memory improved drastically, I could focus, and think clearly, and I quit hallucinating completely. ((Unfortunately my parents are quite literally abusive, narcassistic, and horribly uneducated. Despite living with my grandmother since 9th grade, once they found out I was on antidepressants, they forced me to live with them in an unfinished house (no floors, appliances, ect.) with them and off my medication and made me so suicidal I had to leave and am back with my grandmother that's skipping a TON of important traumatic bullshit but they've turned my grandmother against medication and so I can't get back on it out of respect for her and not wanting to be homeless until I go to university and live on campus. so.)) 

Now that I've been off my medication since early October, late Novemeber, I've just gotten more and more dissociative and hallucinate more and more frequently. I'm worried they're going to increase in severity too. It's easy for me to tell whats hallucinated and whats not, like I don't confuse reality at all, not even for a minute, but today while I was in Mars waiting to talk to my hiring manager about a job I knew I was getting, I hallucinated like, a full on shadow. Like the sun had come out and was shining through the door behind me and it cast a shadow on the right side of some imaginary line and then it faded once I actually like, stared at it for a few seconds. The sun did not come out but thats exactly what it was like. Not bright sun, but just like the clouds went away. But I looked and theres no way that happened, and I could just tell, that it like. It wasn't real. 

I'm worried that maybe this isn't just hallucinating from anxiety and that I might have some more severe thing that's just now coming on or something. It just keeps on getting worse and more frequent, and I don't know anybody else in real life or online that has such constant psychosis from anxiety. I was traumatized a lot when I was younger and throught life, sexual abuse, manipulation, gaslighting, verbal abuse, all that. I just want to know if anyone else is experiencing this and has been told it's from severe anxiety/ptsd, or if I should be worried and get a second opinion on my diagnosis.",t2_2i5x4uha,False,,0,False,Is this normal or something more serious I should get a second opinion on?,[],r/mentalhealth,False,,,0,,False,t3_es28ja,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1579674513.0,text,,,,text,self.mentalhealth,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;m 19F, and haven&amp;#39;t been on medication in about six months.

Edit: while taking a look at them, just thought id clarify that i mean their smiles are oddly big, the ""ear to ear"" variety, nit necessarily constant smiles


is this just a thing that entertaiment picked up because of joker or is it related to some real condition.


exemples of characters:

most jokers from dc comics (i assume)

jinx (league of legends)

ziggs (league of legends)

gamzee makara (usually just REALLY shows it when sober &amp; pissed)

jevil (deltarune)

cicero (skyrim)


while writing this, just noticed that pretty much all of these characters have some sort of thirst for blood, are chaos seekers or love to blow things up. btw feel free to add any characters that fit here.

,mentalhealth,"I was diagnosed with bipolar about 3 years ago. I had the problem for about 8 years in total. It would basically involve having these “episodes” where I seemed to lose the plot. I would talk a lot more, talk a lot of nonsense at a fast pace, embarras myself on social media by posting a lot of cringeworthy sometimes nonsensical posting, I was also violent and aggressive quite often with people who I felt were getting in the way. I felt like I was on my way to achieving greatness. I felt like I was onto a good thing. This led me to be sectioned a couple of times especially when I got violent. I didn’t really suffer with any delusions of hallucinations except possibly grandiose thinking. I would say things like “my sister is the devil” but I didn’t actually believe that it was more like she was getting on my nerves and I wanted people to believe me. I wonder if I’ve been medically “institutionalised” ie believing I am mad so acting that way.

,mentalhealth,"So I’m a middle child, is depressed and have both daddy issues and mommy issues, 

My mom and dad was absent for quite a period of time on and off throughout my childhood. I lived with my grandparents on and off because of that. 

My parents had a not so happy marriage early on. My older sister lived far away from home since I was young because of college, she was a very successful kid and really smart. My youngest sister was lucky she was born when my parents reconciled and be happy together a gain. 

So during the time they were absent and reappear in my life it were pretty rough. They were very verbal towards each other and towards me. I got hit here and there occasionally. So to sum it up, verbally and physically abused. 

Now that I grew up into a decent person, we left all the past behind and live for the present. We love each other and I forgave them about everything. Now we are on good term and I love them dearly, it just seems like I can’t totally shake the past out of me. It had a very huge impact on my personality that I have trouble with trusting people, I’m emotionally unavailable and I have fear of intimacy. 

Now as I am getting older I feel it’s hard to be in a relationship when all I want is to act like a strong independent woman with pretty masculine looks and in the same time fishing for men validation, but not to date them tho. I will run away once someone wants to emotionally get closer to me. 

So please tell me. I want to get help but don’t know where to begin with.

&lt;p&gt;My mom and dad was absent for quite a period of time on and off throughout my childhood. I lived with my grandparents on and off because of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents had a not so happy marriage early on. My older sister lived far away from home since I was young because of college, she was a very successful kid and really smart. My youngest sister was lucky she was born when my parents reconciled and be happy together a gain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So during the time they were absent and reappear in my life it were pretty rough. They were very verbal towards each other and towards me. I got hit here and there occasionally. So to sum it up, verbally and physically abused. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I grew up into a decent person, we left all the past behind and live for the present. We love each other and I forgave them about everything. Now we are on good term and I love them dearly, it just seems like I can’t totally shake the past out of me.

,mentalhealth,"Earlier today, I was legit just waiting for the bus (had my bus pass in hand!) and a police cruiser came around the corner and pulled in to where the buses stop. I got SO paranoid that he was there for me (I did tell my PO about the contact I had yesterday with a cop even though it wasn't a bad thing) that I was just waiting for him to come out of his car and tell me to put my hands on the building behind me...I KNEW I was not doing a DAMN thing illegal. Then another police car went by, but he went straight up the street, not stopping and not paying a bit of attention to me at all. The cop that was stopped in the bus lane was doing something and was on the phone, further fueling my paranoia. Fuck my life. I got on the bus with no problem. Noone stopped me. Noone even cared (well, the bus driver had some sympathy for me when he saw how cold I was from standing out there for a while) and I got home just fine.

My friend, Dante, who is also a convicted arsonist (from WAY back in the day--I am a late bloomer) warned me that I would be paranoid for a while (he still is to this day and he is my age and his incident had been way back when he was little more than a kid) and that if there are any suspicious fires in my area that the police will be knocking on my door...wonderful.

I am listening to the local police scanner frequency on-line and there was just a dumpster fire, but it was in the next  borough over and not in the city. Still, that was my MO...waiting to see if I am contacted. So far nothing.

I don't have any passions or hobbies other than playing videogames and hanging out with friends. I've also been smoking weed on a daily basis (they don't know ofc) and I know it is part of the issue but I've experienced withdrawal effects when trying to stop so at the moment I'm trying to reduce the frequency at which I smoke.

I've had some pretty noticeable mood swings in the past months too. Sometimes I feel really confident like I'm the best me I've ever been and I become very productive but in the end, I always end up not finishing anything. Other times I just skip school because I don't even see the point of getting up to do something I don't enjoy to get a job I don't enjoy and live my life unhappy. 

I also feel really insecure about certain things like my weight, height, my accent (I'm an immigrant) and trivial stuff to some like reading to the class or getting a bad grade are enough to put me on a shitty mood for the rest of the day.

I can't seem to find motivation and I have really bad procrastination issues (for school, any daily tasks my mom asks me to do or even something I decided to do by myself)

As a consequence of all of that, although my grades are still average, they are a lot worse than what they used to be before.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the problem: My parents are divorced and I live with my mom. My mom is the type of person to tell me to endure my problems and they will eventually go away. I also seem very tired most of the time when I see her after school so she might mistake my ""mental problems"" for fatigue. 

Now my dad doesn't believe in mental illness and thinks depression, anxiety and such don't exist. He's the one I'm closest to him and I only rant about stuff to him but for some reason, he always tries to make me feel like I'm not right whenever I do it. Sometimes I just want him to say something like: ""I understand. If you wanna talk I'm here"" instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how to tell them because I'm 100% sure they will both say it's just something temporary that will go away or they will just look the other way and hope for my problems to go away.

I've considered talking about it to one of my teachers but I'm too scared she won't believe me because I really don't look like I would have these kinds of problems. I also can't talk about it to my friends because we used to make fun of it (and I regret it now) and it's just too hypocritical and my pride couldn't take it.

,mentalhealth,"Okay so my grandfather recently passed away and my reaction has been unexpected. Emotionally, I haven't felt as sad as I should be because I'm close. Due to my history I know that it's not based on having some sort of antisocial disorder, I know very well I can feel empathy and sadness over loss. This isn't to say though that I have been well off mentally afterwards. Instead of feeling sad, I feel anxiety over the events of his passing. When he passed, he was having breathing problems and at first it seemed like he was just having a panic attack. Except as you can tell, it ended up not being the case. He fell to the ground and was taken away by the ambulance and announced dead by the time we got to the hospital. 

What this ended up doing to me was effecting my anxiety and OCD. I always had an innate fear of not being able to breath, I used to be able to take a deep breath to convince myself I'm fine and then relax. After this happened, the need to do this kept coming and coming. I spent days constantly taking deep breaths and panicking every time it wasn't a full deep breath. I did this so much it feels like I strained muscles that are involved with deep breaths to the point I can't even do it at all right now. If I try to take a deep breath I feel a sort of strain that stops it from going all the way. I can't really explain it except to say that I don't have any other symptom such as coughing or even regular breathlessness, it's just an inability to take a deep breath that feels like it's because I've overexerted myself doing it constantly for days on end.

Whenever these episodes were at their strongest, I started thinking of the events surrounding my grandfather and start thinking it's going to happen to me. All the details involved with him come to my head and I start to think something to the effect of ""this is it, it's happening"". I start thinking about how this could effect my mother I look at my cat and get scared that I won't be able to care for her and my anxiety just heightens. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense, if you have any questions I can clarify. But what I wanted to know is first of all, can this trauma block any other emotion mentally?

,mentalhealth,"Hi everyone! I'm a 25 year old woman. I've had mental health issues for half my life by now. Mostly stress and low energy related complaints. Right now I'm not in any therapy as I've had so much therapy over the last few years that it felt like the same things being repeated over and over, even in intensive fill time group therapies.

One thing that I never considered a huge issue and never really discussed in my therapy sessions is that I have frequent nightmares (almost every night). Well, not really nightmares, more like bad dreams. Things going wrong, mostly mundane but slightly important things (like missing an exam in school, disappointing a loved one, missing a flight, giving a bad concert, being left alone by friends). There's no monsters, noone is dying - but it's always incredibly stressful and I feel more and more like these dreams are a huge contributing factor to two things that are and have always been huge issues (except when I was on sleeping meds): Waking up frequently during the night and being extremely tired and struggling to get up in the morning (in more 'productive' times of my life I've always been a morning person).

One thing that might be important to note is that these things are always related to current events. Like if I have an exam, I can guarantee dreams about it will happen at some point leading up to it. Also, if I read a book or play a game or watch a movie this will almost always come back in these dreams and never in a good way (often I'm in a similar predicament to the antagonist, for example). I wish I could do something about this but I could hardly avoid all forms of entertainment.

I was wondering if this is something others recognize, and what my options are to prevent these bad dreams (or at least how to handle them). Most information online is targeted at full-out nightmares but that's just not the case. But that doesn't mean that these dreams aren't causing me a lot of trouble...

My mood is very up and down, one doctor suggested I may have cyclothymic disorder, which I’m starting to wonder about. Part of the reason I’ve been reluctant to go back on anti-depressants, besides not wanting to be reliant on meds, is because when I feel good I don’t feel like I need them, but then the downs come and they’re getting worse. But I always leave it to see if it will pass which it does and it’s a nasty cycle which is leaving me drained. I make an effort in my social life but I often feel empty and numb, then I feel incredibly depressed, then I feel normal, then happy, and repeat.

Over the past few years I got extremely deeply intouch with my spiritual side to try and combat all the anxiety , pretty much devoted my life to it , if work was quiet I’d spend the shift researching pretty much anything mind related , I’d get home and watch talks about it on YouTube , read books about it and meditate religiously every night 
I’ve had major success in myself through meditating, I find it easy to distinguish my thoughts and what they truly are . I used to get stuck in the same anxious thought patterns for weeks , now my mind seems to be able to subconsciously pick up on a negative/anxious/depressive thought trains within seconds of it starting , because I know what it is and how it works I can literally choose to remove myself from the thought trail , I managed to full blown feel and talk to my inner child from my higher self , I could feel the entity of it whilst managing to speak to it from a place of serious deep compassion , I’d learnt to completely feel all bad emotion and anxiety inside myself and just letting it be there , learning to do that changed my life immensely, now I found out I have highly sensitive personality I’ve realised it was always the underlying thing causing the majority of my anxiety and it shaped me up to be who I am today , but due to all the mind work I’ve done I now find it very easy to distinguish the thought processes that are just my sensitivity and not get dragged down with them

I seem to be able to say sentences that people are about to say before they’ve even said a thing , on a regular basis I get people say to me ‘ how the F... did you know I was going to say that!?’ 
I can feel the energy of a room of people instantly ,
I can draw the mind , I’ve worked out how certain mind processes work to the point where I can draw a diagram explaining what’s happening in a much easier way for people to understand.
I can draw a picture of the mind seeing/being a thought , I can also draw a picture of the mind observing a passing thought from the conscious.

This winter, I put together an arts magazine called Saving Daylight--a collection of writing and visual art that reflects on seasonal sadness and the ways that art can help get us through the winter. It features work from artists around the world who've struggled with seasonal depression and turn to poetry, photography, fiction, and other creative outlets to cope and work through hard times in their mental health (it also features some fun odds and ends, like cross stitch patterns and playlists to put you in a good mood). [You can buy a copy on Etsy here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/763408965/saving-daylight-issue-1).

Normally I wouldn't use this subreddit to self-promote, but I want to get the word out because I'm donating $5 from every sale to fund research grants at the [Brain and Behavior Research Foundation](https://www.bbrfoundation.org/), so every order will help make a difference in the advancement of mental health treatment research.

The hope is that this zine brings people comfort and makes it just a little bit easier to get through the cold. Hope you enjoy. Stay warm!

,mentalhealth,"i don't want to get too deep into it here but i'll give you the quick rundown:

,mentalhealth,"Sorry if this is rambly, I tried to just get to the point as quick as I could without listing off a ton of specific incidents, more an overview of how I feel.

I have mild tourrete syndrome and in honestly kind of an Aspergers case as well. For most of my childhood everything was ok. Adults didn't really understand my condition fully and it showed at times, there was another kid in my year who I'm pretty sure now was full blown autistic, in the earlier days before he was really struggling to keep up with the class, the teacher wanted me to coach him on coping with his disability, kind of messed up, but whatever.

Until I got to grade 6, before then my teachers showed me respect, I was a straight A student with no record of misbehaving, no reason to give me a hard time. My 6th grade teacher took one look at me and saw a special needs student. At the beginning of the year everybody got to choose their seats, and then a week in he would make tweaks, I got put in the corner of the room with the teacher's aide and two legit special needs kids. 

My school had a traditional program where seniors (6th/7th grade) get to read to the Kindergartners and Grade 1s, everybody would be assigned their own ""little buddy"" and we would get to read to them for like half an hour once a week. I was the only one in class who got excluded because there weren't enough Little Buddies to go around, even though one girl in my class had two little buddies for some reason. He just wrecked my self esteem over and over with mean stunts like that, I got him for Grade 7 as well. 

I went into his classes with Straight As and left with Cs, he threw me into a downward spiral that took a solid decade before I started to show signs of recovery. On the last day of Grade 7 and heading off to High School he told me I was going to be assigned a special needs aide next year to follow me around in each class. That was never true, it was purely out of cruelty that he said that to me.

No teacher in high school was ever as awful to me, but the damage was done. I had no motivation to do anything in school and my grades got worse and worse. I would just sleep in classes, never do my homework, and just barely scrape by with good test scores and make-up assignments during Summer. Every year would be progressively worse, and teachers for some reason just failed to see how ill I was. By grade 11 I was an alcoholic and regularly drinking during classes. In Grade 12 I finally broke halfway through and just dropped out. None of my former friends or classmates knows to this day what actually happened to me. 

I bounced back a bit the following year and graduated through an alternative education program. And then just kind of floundered around for 3 years mostly unemployed and just playing World of Warcraft while being severely depressed. I finally got a full time job at Tim Hortons when I was 22, I went back to school on the side and upgraded all my high school academics. I eventually became manager of the store, and then got headhunted by the CRA to work for the government instead. I know I should be happy with what I've made of myself, but I'm just not.

I'm still damaged, and I am hateful of so much around me in this world. I hate how much hate I have in me all the time. I'm constantly reflecting on my life and who I am and why I am the way I am. There are two people I always remember. The first is my 6th grade teacher, the defining moment in my life where it all went wrong. And my rage just intensifies when I think of it. I can't wrap my head around how awful he is, I wasn't his only victim, how could somebody be that cruel? I can't just move on because I don't accept it, I can't accept that he got away with it.

I often feel like I will never move on until I inevitably publicly confront him and call him out. He does not deserve to have his name unsullied. Wrappin this up, the 2nd person I think of when reflecting on my past was my high school Spanish teacher. She was a really kind person, in my last class with her she gave us all personalized farewell cards. I don't remember most of what she wrote to me, but it opened with ""(Name), I don't understand you..."". Ironic, that she of all my teachers was the closest to ever understanding me.",t2_o7a19,False,,0,False,I'm inescapably angry all the time about how I was treated in my youth.,[],r/mentalhealth,False,,,0,,False,t3_erorgi,False,dark,,public,19,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,19,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1579606126.0,text,,,,text,self.mentalhealth,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is rambly, I tried to just get to the point as quick as I could without listing off a ton of specific incidents, more an overview of how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have mild tourrete syndrome and in honestly kind of an Aspergers case as well. For most of my childhood everything was ok. Adults didn&amp;#39;t really understand my condition fully and it showed at times, there was another kid in my year who I&amp;#39;m pretty sure now was full blown autistic, in the earlier days before he was really struggling to keep up with the class, the teacher wanted me to coach him on coping with his disability, kind of messed up, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until I got to grade 6, before then my teachers showed me respect, I was a straight A student with no record of misbehaving, no reason to give me a hard time. My 6th grade teacher took one look at me and saw a special needs student. At the beginning of the year everybody got to choose their seats, and then a week in he would make tweaks, I got put in the corner of the room with the teacher&amp;#39;s aide and two legit special needs kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My school had a traditional program where seniors (6th/7th grade) get to read to the Kindergartners and Grade 1s, everybody would be assigned their own &amp;quot;little buddy&amp;quot; and we would get to read to them for like half an hour once a week. I was the only one in class who got excluded because there weren&amp;#39;t enough Little Buddies to go around, even though one girl in my class had two little buddies for some reason. He just wrecked my self esteem over and over with mean stunts like that, I got him for Grade 7 as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into his classes with Straight As and left with Cs, he threw me into a downward spiral that took a solid decade before I started to show signs of recovery. On the last day of Grade 7 and heading off to High School he told me I was going to be assigned a special needs aide next year to follow me around in each class. That was never true, it was purely out of cruelty that he said that to me.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Lately I've been having really negative thoughts to the point of considering suicide. 

I don't have a clue why. 

Things seem to be looking up. I got out of my fucking crazy relationship with my abusive ex, I started recording my debut album with my band. I met a fucking fantastic girl who makes me feel things I've never felt before, even when I had been in happy relationships.

But something's sorely missing. I keep feeling so fucking low and angry. The last half hour of college today was really stressful and it put me in such a bad mood. Little things seem to be setting me off and I'm getting so tired of it all. I've been barely sleeping at night, waking up in the middle of the night, unable to sleep anymore.

I feel like I'm making a bigger deal out of it than i should. I feel like i should just get over it. On the surface things seem like they're going well for me. But everything's moving too fucking slow and too fast at the same time. I hate where i live, but i know i wouldn't really be any happier anywhere else and i'm too young and don't have the money to go anywhere else. 

I should be happy. I fucking should be. I have so many reasons to be happy and yet i'm just fucking not. The closest I get to happiness is when I'm around my girlfriend, but we only see each other once or twice every week or so. 

I don't know what to do or who to tell or how to act and its fucking draining me. 

I wouldn't kill myself, but the thought is so tempting sometimes. I know theres no good that could come from it but fuck me i don't want to be here. I'm safe and will remain so but i just want these feelings to go away. I want to feel like me again.

,mentalhealth,"I've been having mild hallucinations for a little over a year now. I'm 19, F, and had been in therapy from the end of Junior year until a little bit into my freshman year of college. When I first got into therapy I had a diagnosis of Cyclothymia and two anxiety disorders, and then they changed my diagnosis to (complex) PTSD. 

I had been going to my guidance counselor for months over my awful mood swings, because they were so intense I would go from so hyper, happy, amped up and wired that I felt fucking amazing, to so miserable I literally wanted to self harm and/or quit breathing just to make it stop, back and forth, like five times a day. I did it twice in a class period and it was such a rapid change in mood it left me exhausted and overwhelmed and tired and sick of feeling how I did. The highs didn't make it worth it when I knew I'd just come crashing down so hard. 

Eventually I started dissociating like really intensely. I felt like I was high on marijuhana before I'd ever even smoked it. Now that I have it felt a lot like that, mixed with being hyper, or sometimes just by itself. I spaced out so much even my boyfriend said I seemed like I was stoned at school and I'd never even touched weed at this point. I couldn't focus enough to hold a conversation at times - I'd forget what I was saying, I'd forget the sentence someone just said to me, I felt floaty, you get the idea.

I started hallucinating, too. It started with dark spots in my vision - but it got worse and worse the more I got worse with my dissociative problem. Theyre both types of psychosis so it makes sense. My therapist told me it was likely due to my severe anxiety - I'm hypervigalent and get chest pains all the time from it even when I feel generally normal. I'm worried I might have something worse than just PTSD though, because the longer I'm off my medication the worse and more frequently they happen. I drove to the nearby city when I wasn't supposed to and my car broke down and I started crying because I was terrified my parents would find out and I full on hallucinated little flecks of light in the top of my vision - almost like embers, but not as round or big and they came and went like shooting stars but smaller and without much of a trail. I see dark spots all the time, including light spots, some are bigger and less opaque, some are smaller and like blotches of darkness - they're really fleeting, they never last more than a few seconds, if that, and when they first started it was maybe a few times a day. Now, it's every day, every hour, usually multiple times an hour. They're not anything severe, because it's just warped versions of light and dark, I'm not seeing like, people or animals or things that aren't real, and I can recognize it as fake, but they're increasing in frequency and I'm worried they're going to increase in severity. Today while I was waiting to talk to a hiring manager for a job I know I'm getting, I hallucinated, but this time it was like a genuine shadow. Normally the shadows I see aren't realistic and are completely out of place, but I saw a shadow all the way across the floor and up part of the wall like the sun came out for a second depsite it being cloudy as fuck - the sun definitely didn't come out. I'm worried I might have something more severe than just anxiety induced hallucinations but I have nothing to compare this to and I don't know exactly what I'm asking. I guess is this similar to the experiences of people who developed more severe disorders? I'm just worried, I've never heard of anyone having so many hallucinations just from anxiety.

At some point I was on Lexapro and Abilify for my anxiety and psychosis. I'd dissociate so hard I'd feel like I could just stick my hand through walls or my bedsheets (but I woildn't try because I knew it was crazy and it'd just snap me out of it really hard). Taking those made my dissociation fade significantly, as well as my hallucinations, and everything else. I certainly don't attribute the medication to my declining mental health. I started them after I began hallucinating too and now that I'm off it makes sense it's getting worse.

Ages 4 to 11 

Mother had many boyfreinds , would party and do drugs in the house , although i had younger siblings me and my older brother were locked in the bedroom from 3pm till the next morning. Typical school week. When it was the weekend me and my older brother would hide in the closet hole we made behind the dresser because when drunk my mother and her neices and freinds would come into our room , pee on us , throw us into freezing showers , try suffocate us with pillows , and at night when the partys dying out i would hear my brother getting raped and eventually me. This happened for years , and when my mother was bored she would lock me in the cellar crawl space for hours on end with the lights off. with a demonic statue. Which i eventually started to talk to. My other siblings were treated soo good and protected by my mothers sisters exc , and growing up in a small town my mother and her siblings labelled me and my older brother as the towns theives and fuck ups at AGE 11 and 13 but we didnt do any of that , i was molested in school by ms.dueck she was a TA and helped me read because i was assumed to be mute. But my jaw hurt and i was always on edge to focus in school. The teachers knew i was being abused but nothing was done! They even let the other kids , thanks to my aunty val telling the other parents how bad we were bully me and my older brother , i remember i was invited to a birthday party when i was 10 , i shoveled driveways for 2 whole days and hid some of that money minus what my mother took , i baught a wicked birthday present , i walked the logans party which was 2 miles and to be yelled at to F*&amp;^ off by his parents.

,mentalhealth,"tia,

you are almost 13. you never thought you'd get this far, and you almost didn't. i know things are hard right now, it has been exactly one month since you saw your mum. i hate to say it, but it will be a very, very long time until you see her again.

life has been absolute shit. you have anorexia nervosa now, and an addiction to meth. you hear voices sometimes too, and 50% of the time you don't even feel like yourself, you feel like a completely different person. the summer after your suicide attempt (good news, it failed) you had a flashback of your mum when you looked in your bathroom mirror so you cut off all your hair and tried to change your name to something with no familial attatchment. then, to make things worse, you got adopted. it was terrible, and you were high the whole day.

you can no longer be used as a sacrafice anymore though, you lost your virginity. that's kind of cool, even though you lost it because the person promised you drugs in return. how could you ever turn that down? during your overdose you somehow managed to smoke your first cigarette out of your bedroom window, it was the closest to heaven you had ever felt. you will smoke many more in the years to come. you opened up quite a bit, not emotionally though. you opened up physically.

your body was less of a temple and more of a motel. a tiny, afraid, underweight motel. you remember almost nothing from when you were 13. your cat also died, and it sucked because you started to like her more than most people. your other cat is still alive, but she's not much like herself. she's old and has dementia. she'll still give you kisses and purr when you hold her though. your grades decline A LOT by the way, it causes a lot of issues for you.

your room triggers you, you hate things touching your body, you cry more often than you let on, you barely leave the house, and you hate yourself more than anything. your life got fucked up because you decided it was a good idea to try meth. it ended with 8 months in a lockdown rehabilitation facility where you were emotionally drained the entire time. you did break the law (twice) and punch a man in the ear while you were there though, that's always a fun story to tell.

yeah, life is still kinda shit. and i hate to break it to you but this will not be your last suicide attempt, you'll try at least 4 more times before you finally give up in a good way.

last year you finally came out as lesbian. you've brought your grades up quite a bit too, and your aunt and uncle are really proud. you don't really care because you feel like it isn't good enough, but either way improvement is always good. you have almost 2 years clean off of meth, which is fucking epic, bro. yeah, rehab gave you some ptsd but at least it helped you clean up your act a bit. you're much less of a pussy now, you sneak out all the time and you always get away with it. you smoke weed with people you never thought you'd get high with, the people who don't want you getting high. it's nice.

my dude, you also get yourself a girlfriend. she is the most beautiful thing on the planet, i can't wait for you to see her in real life, it changes everything. she has bullied you into loving her by always being pretty and smart and caring and sweet. it is bullshit, don't let anyone else do that to you. anyways, she and i/you will be together for 2 years in early march. hell yeah.

in other cool news, there's this really fuckin cool kid who lives down the street. y'all meet at therapy, and now you're best friends. she is by far, the best friend you've ever had, and one of your most favourite people on earth. which is underrstandable, because she's hella pretty and nice and funny and epic. be friends with her for a long time, i will be so mad if i fuck this one up.

like, fuck yeah things suck but bro you have never been so ok either. i wish things were better, but i've learned to settle with ok. it getss better dude, when you wake up you'll be absolutely miserable and sick and tired and afraid, it is by far one of the worst things you'll ever feel. but it doesn't last. nothing does, so just chill out because this is just the tip of the iceberg. it only goes downhill from here.

and then it goes uphill. then things are finally worth it, i promise.

,mentalhealth,"Here is something I sometimes use, when I just need an evening off from my constant overthinking.

When I have a night out that doesn't involve social interaction with people that know me (cinema, theatre, meetup, concert), I try take a vacation from myself to rest my spirit.

,mentalhealth,"I don't know what I want to accomplish by posting here, I've just been feeling like garbage and need to get it out to people who don't know me or expect anything of me, lol. This won't be interesting to read.

I live in Australia, known for being on fire. I'm 25 and was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 14. If you had told me then that I would still be suicidal more than 10 years from then, I don't know if I would have been willing to keep on going. And the thought of another 10 years like this makes me feel so depressed I don't know what to do. I can count the periods of my life since then where I *wasn't* wicked depressed on one hand. And it's stupid, because it's not like I've had any particular struggles. I was diagnosed with ASD at 20 (late, I know), graduated school and moved to a nice city for a reasonably well-paying, entry level, year-long contract in my field at 22. While I was living apart from them my parents split up, but I was already an adult, so.

At 24 I moved back to my hometown for a job that I'd been verbally assured of for the next year - there would be a month of training with several other applicants, and out of them three of us would be hired (so, I thought, me and two others). Two weeks into the training the manager took me aside and told me the guarantee was being rescinded as my performance wasn't what they were expecting (in their words, my demo reel \[I'm an animator\] ""was misleading"". obviously it was all my work lol). I had moved cities at pretty significant expense (animators aren't known for their high salaries), from somewhere with much more opportunity, and felt pretty winded by this - obviously if I had been told ""come here for a month and maybe you'll get hired"", I would have made pretty different plans. Instead of staying for another two weeks to pretty likely get rejected again, I left for a three-month freelance thing, and have been jumping from gig to gig ever since - longer-term positions in animation in my hometown are pretty hard to come by. At the moment I'm working from home, and money is really really tight as hours are pretty hard to nail down when you're working freelance.

After what happened with that studio, I was feeling pretty destabilised and negative about my future in this industry, so I've started studying another discipline part time, online. But I'm finding it very difficult to balance freelancing from home (right now on two separate projects), keeping my life moving w/ cooking, cleaning and all, and study, and my grades aren't good at all, although I know I have ability - I get excellent grades on work I turn in, but other assessments I fail just by nonsubmission because I can't make myself complete them.

My motivation is completely shot. I'm exhausted all the time and cry for no reason every day. I've done everything everyone tells me to - I eat really healthily, almost all food I cook myself, I work out, I have a cat, I make time to see my family and friends, I take my medication every day, I drink plenty of water. (I have PCOS and hypothyroidism, but my doctor won't consider putting me on thyroid medication, so I just try to mitigate what I can with good diet and exercise). I went to a psychiatrist and he just told me to get off my antidepressants and lectured me about big pharma. I've seen lots of psychologists over the last 10 years and faithfully do my mindfulness exercises and interrogate my thoughts for their usefulness and fairness. But I still have anxiety attacks several times a week. I just don't know what to do. I feel overwhelmed by living in the world and by my own uselessness.

,mentalhealth,"I have a history of depression through my teen years. I mostly overcame a lot of my problems through therapy and medication. I also struggled with alcohol for a while and stopped drinking little over a year ago. 

For the last three months I have been feeling incredibly depressed, anxious, overwhelmed by work and alone. It has now reached a point that I find myself considering drastic options: from dropping out of university to potentially killing myself. I don't want to do either of these things, but I feel for the first time in a very long time that I am completely out of control of my environment and that I cannot help myself. I am at a crisis point. I can't eat, sleep, work or anything. 

I am a graduate student, in a fairly high pressure environment at a new university. I do not live on campus and spend most of my free time working a part time job. Everyone on my course is very nice but due to my circumstances, I have no friends. I live with my partner, who is foreign, and due to visa issues will be leaving the country soon. This will leave me geographically and emotionally alone. I cannot speak to my family about my problems as they are very demanding and often not very sympathetic. They also blame my partner for my personal woes and claim she has 'ruined my opportunities' due to her visa situation. I stayed with them for a week over the holidays and only had rows and felt worse. 

I am very stressed by my university work. I am usually fine with this, but have recently been overwhelmed with a sense that I am not good enough, that I cannot meet expectations of my supervisor and effectively that I am destined now to fail. My university doesn't give me grades on individual pieces of work and there is strict limit on the academic support I am allowed to receive, so I have no idea how I am doing, but can only judge based on my own (low) opinion of myself. This is reflected by the fact that I don't really know what I'm doing with upcoming assignments and every time I look for academic advice it is no help. 

The depression paralyses me from doing anything and as a result all aspects of my life worsen. As a result of this, my depression worsens. I have tried getting counselling or seeing a doctor but waiting times are horrendous. I don't know what to do. My degree is for the next five months and I know I cannot live like this for five months, but also I want to get my degree (even if I barely pass). At the same time, I am so miserable - as a consequence of my family life, my partner having to leave, my own self-disappointment and a lack of a support system - that I feel like I don't have many options left. I want to drink again but I know I can't do that.

I know I need help or advice but I don't know who can give it to me and how I can articulate myself to get that help. My academic tutors are not particularly empathetic - nether are my family and friends - and the only person who can support me emotionally will soon be in another continent. 

I just needed to get this off my chest and see if there is any advice.

I mostly overcame a lot of my problems through therapy and medication. I also struggled with alcohol for a while and stopped drinking little over a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last three months I have been feeling incredibly depressed, anxious, overwhelmed by work and alone. It has now reached a point that I find myself considering drastic options: from dropping out of university to potentially killing myself. I don&amp;#39;t want to do either of these things, but I feel for the first time in a very long time that I am completely out of control of my environment and that I cannot help myself. I am at a crisis point. I can&amp;#39;t eat, sleep, work or anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a graduate student, in a fairly high pressure environment at a new university. I do not live on campus and spend most of my free time working a part time job. Everyone on my course is very nice but due to my circumstances, I have no friends. I live with my partner, who is foreign, and due to visa issues will be leaving the country soon. This will leave me geographically and emotionally alone. I cannot speak to my family about my problems as they are very demanding and often not very sympathetic. They also blame my partner for my personal woes and claim she has &amp;#39;ruined my opportunities&amp;#39; due to her visa situation. I stayed with them for a week over the holidays and only had rows and felt worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very stressed by my university work. I am usually fine with this, but have recently been overwhelmed with a sense that I am not good enough, that I cannot meet expectations of my supervisor and effectively that I am destined now to fail. My university doesn&amp;#39;t give me grades on individual pieces of work and there is strict limit on the academic support I am allowed to receive, so I have no idea how I am doing, but can only judge based on my own (low) opinion of myself. This is reflected by the fact that I don&amp;#39;t really know what I&amp;#39;m doing with upcoming assignments and every time I look for academic advice it is no help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The depression paralyses me from doing anything and as a result all aspects of my life worsen. As a result of this, my depression worsens. I have tried getting counselling or seeing a doctor but waiting times are horrendous. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. My degree is for the next five months and I know I cannot live like this for five months, but also I want to get my degree (even if I barely pass). At the same time, I am so miserable - as a consequence of my family life, my partner having to leave, my own self-disappointment and a lack of a support system - that I feel like I don&amp;#39;t have many options left. I want to drink again but I know I can&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I need help or advice but I don&amp;#39;t know who can give it to me and how I can articulate myself to get that help. My academic tutors are not particularly empathetic - nether are my family and friends - and the only person who can support me emotionally will soon be in another continent. &lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"I keep getting ignored. It infuriates me because it KEEPS HAPPENING. Everyone from old friends, family, and even new people I message. It really makes me feel like raging. If this keeps up, I won't be able to contain my depression and anger anymore. The people that will talk to me don't offer much in terms of a conversation, even with my excessive efforts to carry the conversation. They're simply incapable of transcribing their thoughts to text.
   I'm a lonely person. My health is deteriorating. I do just enough to maintain my body so I'm not miserable. I just want to feel like I have a chance to find love or even an unwavering faithful companion. These days, life is becoming a major chore with no compensation. I get no benefits for taking care of myself. Where is the hope I need to continue fighting the loneliness?
   I long for connection to another human being. At the same time, I'm growing colder to everyone and I want to turn violent. Let's see how much I get ignored then. But I don't want to my life to end or the quality of it suffer because people don't want to acknowledge my messages or give me a moment of their time. I have so much to offer. BUT I DON'T EVEN GET THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE TO CHANGE SOMEONE'S MIND. It has almost entirely shifted my self image.
   I used to be happier until I realized that I'm an unapproachable, unappealing, insignificant piece of trash. I cheated on my last serious girlfriend when we were in high school and I gave up on dating or being with someone(by choice) because I burned with remorse. I became content with working on myself, making sure I didn't hurt someone like that again.
   Some years passed, and I decided that I had punished myself and grew enough, that it was time to start looking for a potential mate. Since then, I haven't had anything close to a girlfriend. It's been almost ten years since we broke up and about 7 years since I got back on the horse. This is starting to look like concrete evidence that I'm not worthy of anyone's time. I will probably get pity comments saying contrary, but nothing will change. People will continue to perceive me as something to avoid at all costs.
   What can I do? Is this what it's like trying to date during your twenties? Am I just that ugly? Are skinny people hated? I literally have no clue how to feel better about being so low on the totem pole. 
   That's just my love life, my ex best friend of 10 plus years was the most toxic, manipulative person I've ever met. He ruined my reputation just because we were friends. I couldn't ever perceive the situation from the outside looking in until we had our final falling out. By that time it was too late. Now everyone associates me with him and they probably think I'm a heartless heathen 😭😭 plus who knows what he's been saying about me 😭😭😭 
   This happened somewhat recently and lead me to a deep depression which lead to a severe decrease of my health. It got to the point where I couldn't even walk to my kitchen and fix something to eat without my body trying to shut down from malnutrition. I started eating about a week ago. I don't feel or look as healthy as I did before, but I can actually get up and move around a lot more than before. I have an appetite, a potential job interview coming up, and people that do care about me, but my body craves something more than they can give me.
   I want a best friend. I want to be desired as a mate. I just want to feel like I have a purpose. And with so much strife happening in my life, that throws out any, if not all, possibility of a mate considering me as a candidate until I get my life straightened out. Which, when my life was optimal, the chances were already slim to none. The people that were drawn to me had ulterior motives. They didn't want me for me. 
   Anyways, venting my frustrations have helped me calm down, but I have no direction of what to do next. If you want to help, feel free to ask questions or give advice.

,mentalhealth,"Ok, so I suffer from schizio-affective disorder, as well as aspergers. As such I often act weird or depressed.

So, some background info is needed for context I suppose.

The past few months I have been taking some new medication, and it is really helping a lot. I don't feel suicidal anymore, I feel less depressed, and I don't hear voices in my head as often. However, I find that I am more prone to wild mood changes and swings.

I have one friend, and lately every interaction with him has gone poorly. I either end up being a depressed mess worried that I keep annoying him in some way and trying my best to avoid angering him, which only serves to actually annoy and anger him, or I end up feeling really angry and pissed off and getting in fights with him.

I fear that if this keeps up I'll simply drive him away, and we won't be friends anymore. I don't want this. He has been a good support over the years, and is a great friend. I don't know what to do though.

,mentalhealth,"tl;dr Was discriminated against because of my pyromania. FML.

We have a Recovery Bank for people with addictions to find help and socialize and go to groups, etc. I was told today that because of my conviction/disorder I can not use the Recovery Bank, even though I have already gone to the one SMART Recovery Meeting and did well. The thing that pisses me the fuck off is a guy there with a gambling addiction and they can ""help"" him...I was told there is nothing they can help me with. That guy's addiction and my addiction are in the same fucking category of Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders!!!! It is the SAME kind of addiction as the alcoholics (I am one, ironically, but I have been sober for 3 years so that isn't my issue) and drug addicts. I understand they want to be ""safe"" but I have not EVER shown that I am a danger and I even voluntarily gave up my lighter and had no problem doing so every time I visited. I would even NOT have it on me if it came down to that because getting help is much more important to me than being comfortable having the lighter on me.

I am being discriminated against (the one lady submitted a contract to her boss -- kind of like a safety contract for me, but she said I can't come in there now until they ""discuss"" it) and it hurt me to the core and made me feel like a piece of shit. I told the lady to fuck herself.

At this point, even if they say it is OK...I will tell them to fuck themselves (in those words too) because they are lucky I don't hire a lawyer and go after them. I don't have the time, nor the money, nor the confidence that I would win (and honestly, I don't give a shit anymore now anyhow) to even consider going to a lawyer to sue for discrimination, so fuck this. I want to burn down the fucking building, but of course that would be stupid and I can easily stop myself from doing something that drastic. I wouldn't dare do that anyhow. I don't like torching buildings myself (just paper, wood, junk, and Dumpsters...sigh) because I just can't bring myself to do it, even as strong as my urges are--they don't push me to do that, thank God for that. I like to watch the flames during a house fire, but even that is tainted by the sympathy I feel for the people whose lives are fucked because of a fire.

Then to make my day even MORE fucked, I had police contact today on the way home. I was already pissed off, and I was just sitting outside waiting for the bus (I was sitting on the one side of the building where the bus stop is because the wind was strong and the building blocked it mostly) and I guess I was there for a while because all of a sudden, a cop car made a U-Turn (HAHAH illegally lol) and stopped on the corner. I saw him turn and said ""fuck me..."" because I knew he was gonna stop. I wasn't in trouble because I was just sitting, trying to stay warm. It was extremely cold and windy, so I looked like I was homeless (we are just one tiny step up from homeless right now and struggling to hang on by a thread) so he was just checking on me to make sure I was OK. He had the greatest British accent lol...and he was kinda good-looking...not that I noticed or anything ahahahaha. I still have to report that to my Probation Officer. I left a message (called as soon as I got home), and I actually see her tomorrow, so it's all good. I think I have 24 hours to report police contact and this wasn't anything serious so phew.

I got $2 from some caring person passing by...sigh. People are really assholes. I wasn't outwardly begging for money (even though it isn't illegal to ask for money as long as you aren't being aggressive or stopping traffic) but damn...I was grateful for that couple dollars, which I gave to my hubby so he can get gas for the car to get to the bank tomorrow.

Please don't judge me or give me shit about being on the streets...I am doing what I have to until our money comes in (SSI for the 3 boys) at the end of the month. I don't get my money (Disability) until March 3, so it will be fine after that. We are just struggling at the moment. I would NEVER go as far as prostituting myself---I definitely draw a HARD line at that!!!!

And before you say it--yes, we have asked for help and have received food, etc. but with 4 kids at home to feed, what little food we get (I am THANKFUL for everything) has to stretch to breaking. My hubby and I go hungry at night. Thankfully, I get food at the Counseling Center (lunch) and the kids get free breakfast and lunch at school. Hubby also makes due with what we have but often doesn't eat all day. I am not looking for pity, ok? It is what it is, and things are going to get better.

I guess that is why I am so fucking PISSED at this Recovery Bank discrimination--they were the ones helping us with food!!! I have some calls in, so hopefully we can get what we need elsewhere. I know there are food banks and stuff, but we already got food this month from a lot of them. They absolutely help, and again, I am grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this is a book. :( I just needed to vent. We are getting minimal food stamps for now, but that is going to stop in March when I get my checks again because we will make just about $100 too much. Then again, we will have all that extra money (from my check) coming in, so it balances itself out nicely.

Grrrrrrrr. Fucking hell. Thanks for reminding me yet AGAIN that I am a fucking ""dangerous"" person, though I haven't done ANYTHING (at any of the programs I go to) to show that I am a danger. I am a danger just by virtue of being a fucking pyromaniac.

If I didn't have family--I would SO fucking end my lousy existence once and for all. I have a loving and supportive family so that is enough to keep me here. Plus I REALLY like the Partial Hospitalization Program (at the Counseling Center) too. It is really beneficial and I don't have to pretend to be someone I am not when I am there, unlike when I go out into public.

It is the SAME kind of addiction as the alcoholics (I am one, ironically, but I have been sober for 3 years so that isn&amp;#39;t my issue) and drug addicts. I understand they want to be &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; but I have not EVER shown that I am a danger and I even voluntarily gave up my lighter and had no problem doing so every time I visited. I would even NOT have it on me if it came down to that because getting help is much more important to me than being comfortable having the lighter on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am being discriminated against (the one lady submitted a contract to her boss -- kind of like a safety contract for me, but she said I can&amp;#39;t come in there now until they &amp;quot;discuss&amp;quot; it) and it hurt me to the core and made me feel like a piece of shit. I told the lady to fuck herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, even if they say it is OK...I will tell them to fuck themselves (in those words too) because they are lucky I don&amp;#39;t hire a lawyer and go after them. I don&amp;#39;t have the time, nor the money, nor the confidence that I would win (and honestly, I don&amp;#39;t give a shit anymore now anyhow) to even consider going to a lawyer to sue for discrimination, so fuck this. I want to burn down the fucking building, but of course that would be stupid and I can easily stop myself from doing something that drastic. I wouldn&amp;#39;t dare do that anyhow. I don&amp;#39;t like torching buildings myself (just paper, wood, junk, and Dumpsters...sigh) because I just can&amp;#39;t bring myself to do it, even as strong as my urges are--they don&amp;#39;t push me to do that, thank God for that. I like to watch the flames during a house fire, but even that is tainted by the sympathy I feel for the people whose lives are fucked because of a fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then to make my day even MORE fucked, I had police contact today on the way home. I was already pissed off, and I was just sitting outside waiting for the bus (I was sitting on the one side of the building where the bus stop is because the wind was strong and the building blocked it mostly) and I guess I was there for a while because all of a sudden, a cop car made a U-Turn (HAHAH illegally lol) and stopped on the corner. I saw him turn and said &amp;quot;fuck me...&amp;quot; because I knew he was gonna stop. I wasn&amp;#39;t in trouble because I was just sitting, trying to stay warm. It was extremely cold and windy, so I looked like I was homeless (we are just one tiny step up from homeless right now and struggling to hang on by a thread) so he was just checking on me to make sure I was OK. He had the greatest British accent lol...and he was kinda good-looking...not that I noticed or anything ahahahaha. I still have to report that to my Probation Officer. I left a message (called as soon as I got home), and I actually see her tomorrow, so it&amp;#39;s all good. I think I have 24 hours to report police contact and this wasn&amp;#39;t anything serious so phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got $2 from some caring person passing by...sigh. People are really assholes. I wasn&amp;#39;t outwardly begging for money (even though it isn&amp;#39;t illegal to ask for money as long as you aren&amp;#39;t being aggressive or stopping traffic) but damn...I was grateful for that couple dollars, which I gave to my hubby so he can get gas for the car to get to the bank tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t judge me or give me shit about being on the streets...I am doing what I have to until our money comes in (SSI for the 3 boys) at the end of the month. I don&amp;#39;t get my money (Disability) until March 3, so it will be fine after that. We are just struggling at the moment. I would NEVER go as far as prostituting myself---I definitely draw a HARD line at that!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And before you say it--yes, we have asked for help and have received food, etc. but with 4 kids at home to feed, what little food we get (I am THANKFUL for everything) has to stretch to breaking. My hubby and I go hungry at night. Thankfully, I get food at the Counseling Center (lunch) and the kids get free breakfast and lunch at school. Hubby also makes due with what we have but often doesn&amp;#39;t eat all day. I am not looking for pity, ok? It is what it is, and things are going to get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that is why I am so fucking PISSED at this Recovery Bank discrimination--they were the ones helping us with food!!! I have some calls in, so hopefully we can get what we need elsewhere. I know there are food banks and stuff, but we already got food this month from a lot of them. They absolutely help, and again, I am grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry this is a book. :( I just needed to vent. We are getting minimal food stamps for now, but that is going to stop in March when I get my checks again because we will make just about $100 too much. Then again, we will have all that extra money (from my check) coming in, so it balances itself out nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grrrrrrrr. Fucking hell. Thanks for reminding me yet AGAIN that I am a fucking &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot; person, though I haven&amp;#39;t done ANYTHING (at any of the programs I go to) to show that I am a danger. I am a danger just by virtue of being a fucking pyromaniac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I didn&amp;#39;t have family--I would SO fucking end my lousy existence once and for all. I have a loving and supportive family so that is enough to keep me here. Plus I REALLY like the Partial Hospitalization Program (at the Counseling Center) too. It is really beneficial and I don&amp;#39;t have to pretend to be someone I am not when I am there, unlike when I go out into public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m done.../rantover.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"So I dated a girl a few months ago, who for all intents and purposes was an awesome dating experience for me; she was a beautiful, smart, inspiring Philipino girl who expressed after our second date that she didnt want to exclusively date me, but rather a fwb type ordeal, so I decided to stop having any hope for exclusivity and simply chose to indulge in the fwb and enjoy it while it lasted. She relatively early on(a month of hanging out all throughout the week) expressed that she loved me(and often), and would pay for a grand majority of our dates  She had no qualms about buying me clothes(she would propose it if we walked past clothes sections whenever we went to Target); she spoiled me with affection, sex and financial security. Randomly, she would bring up the idea of whether or not she should(literally asking herself out loud, in front of me) exclusively date me, but ultimately deciding each time that she didn't want to commit(She would ask herself as a rhetorical question, out loud). That didnt stop us from looking like a couple in every way shape and form. She called me ""babe"" and always told me she loved me and would try to make me feel special compared to a gym trainer she was also dating(she would share this with me, without me inquiring about it).

I cant explain exactly why, buy I couldnt help but feel so strongly in my gut that she was using me somehow(an intuition I suppose) but i kept rationalizing things with, ""well, why would she; she spoils me rotten and asks for nothing in return other than sex and dates which she funds"". She encouraged me to go to school to better myself, but at the same time, she had little emotional support for me; if I was going through a depression episode(I'm diagnosed with major depression) she had little compassion or empathy for me not being able to willpower through it during low points. She expressed that she has Antisocial Personality Disorder, as a means of apparently trying to relate to me.

One day I ask if she'd be up for doing a meditative practice with me(I regularly practice meditation; I was curious about an eye contact variation of it and did it with two other people), where I set a 5 minute timer and we sit in front of each other and maintain eye contact with one another. She had no problem maintaining eye contact with me, which i found surprising, because my prior ""eye contact"" participants could hardly do so without frequent bouts of laughter or noticeable nervous unease. At one point, I noticed a moment that really stood out to me, which I found uncanny. For only a few seconds, the muscles around her eyes seemed to fully relax and those eyes which once illusively held emotional expression now appeared as mere fleshy pinholes pointed at me. Sort of like her face was merely a mask that for a brief moment, faltered and I happened to spot it. 

Ive read amateur Psychologists online speak of Socio/Psychopaths with shark eyes and I tend to be real skeptical of Psuedo psychology, but this moment stunted my skepticism.

Randomly, she would bring up the idea of whether or not she should(literally asking herself out loud, in front of me) exclusively date me, but ultimately deciding each time that she didn&amp;#39;t want to commit(She would ask herself as a rhetorical question, out loud). That didnt stop us from looking like a couple in every way shape and form. She called me &amp;quot;babe&amp;quot; and always told me she loved me and would try to make me feel special compared to a gym trainer she was also dating(she would share this with me, without me inquiring about it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cant explain exactly why, buy I couldnt help but feel so strongly in my gut that she was using me somehow(an intuition I suppose) but i kept rationalizing things with, &amp;quot;well, why would she; she spoils me rotten and asks for nothing in return other than sex and dates which she funds&amp;quot;. She encouraged me to go to school to better myself, but at the same time, she had little emotional support for me; if I was going through a depression episode(I&amp;#39;m diagnosed with major depression) she had little compassion or empathy for me not being able to willpower through it during low points. She expressed that she has Antisocial Personality Disorder, as a means of apparently trying to relate to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I ask if she&amp;#39;d be up for doing a meditative practice with me(I regularly practice meditation; I was curious about an eye contact variation of it and did it with two other people), where I set a 5 minute timer and we sit in front of each other and maintain eye contact with one another. She had no problem maintaining eye contact with me, which i found surprising, because my prior &amp;quot;eye contact&amp;quot; participants could hardly do so without frequent bouts of laughter or noticeable nervous unease. At one point, I noticed a moment that really stood out to me, which I found uncanny. For only a few seconds, the muscles around her eyes seemed to fully relax and those eyes which once illusively held emotional expression now appeared as mere fleshy pinholes pointed at me. Sort of like her face was merely a mask that for a brief moment, faltered and I happened to spot it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive read amateur Psychologists online speak of Socio/Psychopaths with shark eyes and I tend to be real skeptical of Psuedo psychology, but this moment stunted my skepticism. Am I reading way too into this, or can someone provide an explanation that will satisfy my curiosity?&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Hi first time posting hoping to find a little clarity, I'm typically not the type to reach out for help and when I do my girlfriend and close friends usually give me the clarity needed, but with this current situation I believe multiple points of view would help.

I (18m) live with my girlfriend of 8 months and have a wonderful relationship as a whole as well as living together comes easy. I work as a carpenter making 18 an hour, not good but not bad for fresh out of highschool. I've typically always dealt with suicidal thoughts, and nihilism but was never medicated nor have I seen anyone, I personally dont like the idea of meds as i self medicated for a while (I understand its different) and always found the same conclusion being strength in myself and self sufficiency. As of recent I havnt had any major depressive episodes or anything of the like but life has gotten stressful. I found myself 2k in debt, a major medical situation arose with my girlfriend which also effects me personally. 

Now that the info is over here's my main issues I'm seeking advice on:

1. I have a terrible desire to invade my girlfriends privacy, earlier in our relationship that showed as checking her phone, but after being blatantly told that was totally uncool I stopped and was proud of myself. To be honest until i met her i never saw stuff like that as toxic as I've never understood the concept of privacy nor have i ever had any growing up which always gave me the mindset of privacy = hiding something. For about 4 months now I've switched my views and have respected my girlfriends privacy although I dont understand it. Now the issue with it is I dont think shes cheated, nor am I doing it out of curiosity its simply I liked knowing what was going on and understanding her from her personal point of view. I still will find myself up late at night fighting the extreme urges to check her phone, I always prevail but it leaves me unfulfilled in a sense, almost empty like I'm missing something (I'm very much the type that likes to know everything and figure people out, how they think etc.) because of that I end up hating myself for dealing with these temptations because they arnt anxiety or self esteem moreso I'm just fucked up and awful and I deeply feel the need to invade privacy for my own selfish gain.

My second issue as of late is the more pressing one, I feel like a complete failure, my own confidence ive always rellied on tells me ""thats ridiculous you're 18 with a house, a dog, a cat, food on the table, a vehicle you own, a wonderful girlfriend, good musical talent, good looks, good ethic, and good maturity for your age"" but for some reason I feel like I'm always failing, not being good enough to my girlfriend after 1 slip up, being a employee for working 40 hours instead of 50, being a bad man of the house for coming in a little short on cash and we have to eat ramen, etc. This has been rotting me out from the inside I only sleep 3 hour nights, those 3 hours I have hellish nightmares, I lay in bed despising myself, my psychosis relapsed and I find myself crying wanting the hell to end wondering why I'm so fucked up yet doing so well. For example here's the dream I had last night taken from my dream journal:

""Last night I fell asleep at 3 woke up at 7 those 4 hours were spent in nightmares of me wading through rivers and oceans of my deceased offspring, they all called out asking why I created them with my fucked up genes and why I'd create atrocities, they all were spiting me for having part of me in them, and I tried to help them, and my girlfriend but I failed everytime, they all despised me and I was trying my hardest, every moment of existing there was pain and I felt it I wanted nothing else but to die yet I wanted to help my children,  and my girlfriend.  They castrated me saying it would rid the world of my seed, and that anything that sprouted from it would have myself in them and would suffer eternally because of it. I was paralyzed all I could do was stand and watch as these thousands of babies were tormented internally the same way I was, they were throwing themselves off cliffs, gouging at each other, anything to die but they all failed""

I'm honestly looking for clarity or really just other peoples opinions on this.

I should disclaim:
-This is not making me suicidal
-I want to see a doc but I have little money and no insurance 
-My mind is typically dark and extreme dreams, thoughts, or episodes of psychosis in which I witness such as above are not uncommon yet I felt like that one had meaning

,mentalhealth,"I'm currently in therapy after experiencing rape and being in an abusive relationship (two separate people). My therapist and I have discussed that I entered these relationships because I felt that I deserved to be treated that way or was already used to being treated badly. She suggested that this may have come from my family. I've always thought my family was relatively normal and healthy, but looking back I'm starting to notice some things that were off. 

I tried running away as a child at least three times, from ages 9-12. I first started thinking about self-harming when I was 12, then actually started doing it when I was 15. 15 was when I first started considering suicide, though I didn't attempt it until 20, which was after the rape and abusive relationship. At a very young age, around 7-8, I really enjoyed drawing violent gory images and showing them to other kids, because I thought it was funny how uncomfortable it made them. I remember experiencing intense anger at my younger brothers, to the point where I imagined, in gruesome detail, how I would like to kill them. I took pleasure in imagining this and it provided some relief for my anger. I had a friend who gave me a stick that they carved into a knife, and one day I got so angry at my youngest brother that I actually stabbed him. (the ""blade"" wasn't even an inch long, it was just a cone-shaped point on the end. but it did draw blood). 

If I heard of another child doing these things, I'd think it was definitely a psychopath in the making. But I'm 21 now and I would never want to hurt anyone. I never intentionally hurt animals or people (besides my brother). I was raped at age 17 and in an abusive relationship from 18-20. The past few years have been very cold, lonely, and numb. 

It's clear to me that something was wrong with me as a child. Something must have happened or been wrong in my family that made me so angry. The two biggest themes of my childhood are loneliness and anger. I never had good self-esteem, never had many friends, was always shy and quiet.

,mentalhealth,"I’m sorry if this wasn’t an appropriate sub to do this...

throwaway because my actual u/ is recognizable. I also apologize in advance that I’m going to explain a lot and it’s going to be really long, but this will be the first time I’ve ever told the entire story to someone, and I just need to do it. 

In April 2018, I [20F at the time] was at a university event with a ton of people that I knew and that knew me very well. I had just broken up with my boyfriend of almost a year, but we were still figuring out what breaking up looked like, because I was his first girlfriend, and it was generally a weird time. Anyway, so at this event, there was a guy who was 4(ish) years older than me who I didn’t know. He took an interest in me and it was sweet at first, as I had not really been hit on for over a year since being in the relationship. It very quickly became very uncomfortable. In pretty much every photo from that event, it looks normal, but I know that his hand was up my dress behind the scenes. He tried to kiss me against a wall at one point during the night but I pushed him off and ignored his advances for the rest of the first half of the night. 

Later on that night, my roommate who was also at the event and I invited a group of our friends back to our house to drink and wind down the night closer to home. I didn’t know until we were already at my house that someone that my roommate had invited had driven the guy to and from the event, and so he showed up at my house. He was one of my roommates friends, which I also didn’t know until this point. I didn’t want to be rude and cause a scene, so I didn’t say anything. I made a point to sit in our armchair, so he couldn’t sit next to me, and also positioned the chair on the complete opposite side of the room, with the large, circular coffee table between us (this is important). Cut a long story slightly shorter, I ended up getting way more drunk than I intended to, more than I originally thought I was at the time. 

By this point in the night, our other friends had mostly begin to filter out and go home. After saying goodbye to them, there was my roommate, me, the guy and his ride from earlier left in the house. My roommate went to the bathroom and I’m not sure where the ride went. I went to get up to put my glass in the sink in the kitchen, and in order to do so I had to walk around the coffee table. I don’t really know why I didn’t walk around all the couches, if I had maybe none of this would’ve happened. I hate myself for that. When I did this, I had my glass in one hand and my phone in the other. As I walked around, he told me to come sit with him, and I said “no, I’m going to the kitchen” he said something else, then reached up and grabbed my hand that was holding my phone and pulled me down into his lap. I remember trying to get up and not being able to, dropping the glass onto the couch, and him putting my phone out of reach.

Apparently by this point, my roommate and the ride saw this, me on top of his lap, and decided that it was consensual, since I’d just broken up with my boyfriend and they’d seen him flirting with me beforehand. She also claims that she had asked me how I felt about him earlier in the night and I laughed but didn’t say anything, but I don’t remember this. Ultimately, my roommate and the ride decided not to intervene and the ride drove home and left the guy with me, and my roommate went to bed. 

The last thing I remember that night is being guided or carried into my room and the door slamming behind me. I remember also feeling overpowered and scared, because he was extremely tall, especially by my standards (I’m above 5’10 for reference without specificity). When I “came to” I was shaking uncontrollably in bed around 7/8am the next morning. I rolled over and someone was in bed next to me. I thought perhaps my roommate had left the door unlocked and my ex-boyfriend had come over to try and talk, found that I was too drunk and decided to stay. I checked my phone first for evidence of that, and of course there was nothing. Then I finally saw his face and realized what was going on. Panic set in, and there’s a lot of blanks after this too. I remember that he woke up like nothing was wrong and asked if I’d give him a ride home. I didn’t really know how to respond to that because I’ve never been good with confrontation. I took him home. As soon as he got out of my car, I broke down. I had the worst panic attack I’d ever had in the parking lot adjacent to his house. I was probably there for more than an hour, because I remember I didn’t get home until after noon. 

I tried to talk to my roommate about what happened, and we ended up falling out as friends because she didn’t believe I would dare to accuse one of her friends of rape because she’d seen me sitting on his lap, which she took was being consensual. I don’t necessarily agree with that, but I honestly wasn’t in the right state of mind to argue with her over something I couldn’t remember or even begin to explain. She accused me of calling it rape to cover up me cheating on my boyfriend, but I hadn’t told her that we’d broken up already and wouldn’t believe me after I told her. So we cut our losses, moved out and moved on.

Honestly? I [now 23 at the time of this post] don’t know if this is actually rape. I’ll let you all answer that for me, I guess. But since then, I’m damaged. I was a victim of domestic abuse/violence two years before this happened, and the year in between I was drugged at a party and would’ve put money on me dying (but thankfully was well taken care of by kind strangers who have since become friends). The culmination of all of these things affects me every day. I’ve never had therapy, because my family does not believe in it, and even if they did approve, I couldn’t afford it. I can’t maintain or even desire being in a relationship, having sex is terrifying but I do it to make the other person happy and hope that one day I’ll just have sex and I won’t be scared anymore. I can’t make even the most basic decisions by myself, I always require reassurance or someone else to decide for me, because I guess I feel like all of my past decisions have led to trauma. I have flashbacks and random panic attacks  while out with friends, and now it’s affecting me at work due to what I do (ironically, therapy.) 

Any kind of advice or help you can offer me or even just talking to me would help at this point. I’m consistently sitting on the edge just waiting for the next traumatic thing to happen.

,mentalhealth,"I was put on Psych meds at 19 (I'm now 31) after a panic attack.

The meds were prescribed by the family GP and he didn't monitor me on them.  Fast forward 5 years and they stopped working so he prescribed me another one.

I suffer from Chronic Fatigue after a bout of Glandular Fever that I never fully recovered from. I thought the meds might be contributing to the fatigue so I weaned off early 2018.

The withdrawals were very tough so I went to a Psychiatrist and he prescribed me another med + an antipsychotic at a low dose to help with my trouble sleeping. I had a terrible reaction and developed Akathisia. It sent me into a month long spiral of terror and involuntary movements.

I stopped taking the meds and refuse to take anymore because Akathisia was the most indescribable terror I have ever experienced, worse than any panic attack or depressive episode.

Ever since then I have what I can only describe as brain damage. I can't handle any mental stress. By stress I mean anytime I have to concentrate, like right now my feet are twitching, ears are ringing and I am heavily agitated because I have to focus while writing this. 

I have no respite, I can't exercise because of Chronic Fatigue, I can't take medication to ease the mental side effects, and I am deathly scared of seeing a mental health professional. The power they have frightens me and I don't trust them enough not to send me to the psych ward. I'm too scared that if I say something that alarms them (I'm not suicidal) they will have me admitted. If I get admitted I will be given medication. There's a chance that the medication will cause Akathisia and I will die. That isn't a dramatisation. I will die.

I feel, fake in a way, like I’m just being an attention seeker. Like I want to have a mental illness but I don’t. I will think “hey wouldn’t it be great if I had a panic attack right now?” And shit like that. I can’t talk about this to my friends because I am the one with no problems, a good family, happy life etc... I listen to their problems all the time and get involved in their drama. I feel like a walking talking therapist who can make funny jokes about having depression and talk a bit about how I am sad sometimes, then it goes back to them and all. I feel like trash because I know they need it and I am honestly good. They are the ones who have tried to commit suicide and have parents that don’t love them. The ones who rave run away from home and had exes cheat on them. I just feel like an attention whore for even thinking about bothering them with my minor problems. Going back, I remember the first time I cut, I was so proud to show my friend who introduced it to me because I was like her! Even now when my friends cut they show me and our friend group and their other friends.

I feel like a walking talking therapist who can make funny jokes about having depression and talk a bit about how I am sad sometimes, then it goes back to them and all. I feel like trash because I know they need it and I am honestly good. They are the ones who have tried to commit suicide and have parents that don’t love them. The ones who rave run away from home and had exes cheat on them. I just feel like an attention whore for even thinking about bothering them with my minor problems.

\- she texted me to say that ""You had failed to attend your session"".

\- I apologised for this and then contacted her for another appointment and since then she's ignored me.

,mentalhealth,"I am a 17M. 

So this all started with this incident nearly 2 months ago, where food was stuck in my throat and i thought i night choke any second. I kept on panicking and panicking and panicking. I then developed globus sensation after 1 whole week of constant extreme worrying and stressing out. I wouldn't eat for a whole week and not exercise at all.

I would smoke weed even tho i knew i had a bad throat problem and had depersonalization and when i would get high it got worse and i got some bad depersonalization after. (I have had depersonalization before all this but it was weak and its stronger then ever as i type)

I then got over the throat problem but then developed heart palpitations. I cut out sugar and some time went by and it stopped. 

I then now got stomach cramps and gas probably related to the throat problem but i don't have acid reflux. It still probably affects my stomach somehow (my globus sensation)

Going thru all this one right after the other to the end has really freaking messed me up. I feel way more stronger depersonalization all the time, i can't eat during the evenings and nights because my throat feels worse and i cannot eat comfortably, feel stomach problems once every few days, am experiencing masturbation withdrawals symptoms, reduced sugar intake... i feel like am really going crazy especially at night times. And a combination of everything i'm experiencing can kill me?

Am i going crazy? Am i going to die?",t2_56ghsozs,False,,0,False,Am i going crazy or am going to die?,[],r/mentalhealth,False,,,0,,False,t3_errg8e,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1579621652.0,text,,,,text,self.mentalhealth,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a 17M. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this all started with this incident nearly 2 months ago, where food was stuck in my throat and i thought i night choke any second. I kept on panicking and panicking and panicking. I then developed globus sensation after 1 whole week of constant extreme worrying and stressing out. I wouldn&amp;#39;t eat for a whole week and not exercise at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would smoke weed even tho i knew i had a bad throat problem and had depersonalization and when i would get high it got worse and i got some bad depersonalization after. (I have had depersonalization before all this but it was weak and its stronger then ever as i type)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then got over the throat problem but then developed heart palpitations. I cut out sugar and some time went by and it stopped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then now got stomach cramps and gas probably related to the throat problem but i don&amp;#39;t have acid reflux. It still probably affects my stomach somehow (my globus sensation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going thru all this one right after the other to the end has really freaking messed me up. I feel way more stronger depersonalization all the time, i can&amp;#39;t eat during the evenings and nights because my throat feels worse and i cannot eat comfortably, feel stomach problems once every few days, am experiencing masturbation withdrawals symptoms, reduced sugar intake... i feel like am really going crazy especially at night times. And a combination of everything i&amp;#39;m experiencing can kill me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am i going crazy? Am i going to die?&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"**2020 plan**

2020: new year, new decade, new chapter of my life. 2020 is my year, the year to improve myself. 

**MAIN GOAL: GET INTO SHAPE!!!**

**Short term**

&amp;#x200B;

* Become healthier (drink more water, less carbs, more fruit and veg)
* Join a gym
* Be friendlier with people (make new friends)
* Spend more time with parents
* Keep weekly journals
* Hand in all assignments in on time
* Spend more time on self care/digital detox
* Have a more positive outlook on things
* Less frivolous with my money 

**Long term**

&amp;#x200B;

* Loose weight
* Become more advance with boxing
* Stop biting my nails
* Go abroad
* Treat my family (gifts)
* Talk to people more (trust certain people more)
* Become more productive (create notes/plans)
* Aim for distinctions at the end of June
* Improve concentration
* Don’t get annoyed so easily

It takes in average 66 days to create new habits, so for the first 2 months stick with everything, and slowly it will be easier to carry on doing those things (resist biting your nails, drink water even when your not thirsty, smile even if you’re not 100% happy)

**Ways to loose weight**

**Food and drink**

&amp;#x200B;

* Cut back on sugar (low/no sugar)
* Cut back on starches
* Reduce appetite (eat less in meals)
* Drink 2,000 ml water a day
* Stick to water all day or low sugar squash/juice
* No “dirty” snacking between meals, only fruit or veg or health bars (low sugar) 
* No fizzy drinks during the week, only no sugar fizzy on weekend
* Only grilled salads, water and fruit at work

**Exercise**

&amp;#x200B;

* Run x2 a week (Tuesday and Thursday)
* Do at least 50 squats, 50 sit-ups, 30 press-ups a day
* Boxing x2 a week and football x2 a week

**Selfcare and skincare**

&amp;#x200B;

* Create a routine with skin (wash moisture etc.)
* Try to wear less makeup; which would clear up your skin, make it healthier and boost your self-esteem in the long run
* Maintain a good daily selfceare routine (brush hair, brush teeth, shower reguarly, change bed sheets regularly)

&amp;#x200B;

* Weigh myself everyday
* Keep a food and weight diary as much as possible

**Ways to become a better person**

**Make small everyday changes**

&amp;#x200B;

* Make the bed in the morning
* Put clothes away/wash basket at the end of the everyday
* Create a to do list if need to do something that day
* Make notes of things that had happened that day/week 

**Have a more positive outlook on things**

&amp;#x200B;

* Wake up and think “you’ve got this”
* Smile more
* Rather than assuming things think about it realistically
* Go into things positively, rather than assuming its going to be bad

**Remove any toxicity from your life**

&amp;#x200B;

* Any toxic relationships: GET RID OF THEM
* Stay clear of people who have a negative influence on your life (people who do the wrong things, whether it’s behaviour or actions etc.)

Removing any toxicity from your life will clear your mind up of having to always please people or do things for them. Cut them out of your life, do things for yourself and protect your physical and mental health.

**Management**

**Money wise**

&amp;#x200B;

* Stop being frivolous with your money, its not an ever-growing tree
* Don’t feel pressured to get something, just because everyone else is
* Remember you have bills to pay 
* Only buy things if an absolute necessity 
* Each week plan anything that may need to be brought (presents etc.)
* Make sure to be paid by people by said times

**Life wise**

&amp;#x200B;

* Make plans of things that need to be done (appointments, organising room etc.)
* Keep a weekly diary with picture (free prints each month)—&gt; to then possibly create a scrapbook of the year
* Manage your times, if you have to be somewhere by a certain time plan when you’re going to get ready/leave etc. and remember its better to be early than late, so plan to get to your location 10 minutes before
* Declutter cupboards, only keep things you actually need
* Buy gifts at least a month before someones birthday/christmas
* Priories people (family first)
* Priories things (tidy room is more of a priority than playing games on your phone)

**Relationships and social life**

**Build up relationships with people you interact with on a daily basis**

&amp;#x200B;

* If you work with people, say good morning, smile at them, make that little effort with them
* People you live with, help them with any chores etc.
* People you love, show them more affection

Making that little gesture can offer an olive branch and build up stronger relationships in the long run

**Social media**

&amp;#x200B;

* Take time away from social media and spend time with people in person
* Unfollow those celebrities/models that are setting unrealistic standards 
* Buy gifts at least a month before someones birthday/Christmas be badshower regularly, change bed sheets regularly))to see things you’re posting",t2_5bbmqvul,False,,0,False,2020 plan - new me,[],r/mentalhealth,False,,,0,,False,t3_err0w3,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1579618845.0,text,,,,text,self.mentalhealth,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020 plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020: new year, new decade, new chapter of my life. 2020 is my year, the year to improve myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAIN GOAL: GET INTO SHAPE!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short term&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become healthier (drink more water, less carbs, more fruit and veg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join a gym&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be friendlier with people (make new friends)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more time with parents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep weekly journals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand in all assignments in on time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more time on self care/digital detox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a more positive outlook on things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less frivolous with my money &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long term&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loose weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become more advance with boxing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop biting my nails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go abroad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat my family (gifts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to people more (trust certain people more)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become more productive (create notes/plans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim for distinctions at the end of June&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve concentration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t get annoyed so easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes in average 66 days to create new habits, so for the first 2 months stick with everything, and slowly it will be easier to carry on doing those things (resist biting your nails, drink water even when your not thirsty, smile even if you’re not 100% happy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ways to loose weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and drink&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut back on sugar (low/no sugar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut back on starches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce appetite (eat less in meals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink 2,000 ml water a day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stick to water all day or low sugar squash/juice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No “dirty” snacking between meals, only fruit or veg or health bars (low sugar) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No fizzy drinks during the week, only no sugar fizzy on weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only grilled salads, water and fruit at work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run x2 a week (Tuesday and Thursday)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do at least 50 squats, 50 sit-ups, 30 press-ups a day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boxing x2 a week and football x2 a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selfcare and skincare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a routine with skin (wash moisture etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to wear less makeup; which would clear up your skin, make it healthier and boost your self-esteem in the long run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a good daily selfceare routine (brush hair, brush teeth, shower reguarly, change bed sheets regularly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weigh myself everyday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a food and weight diary as much as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ways to become a better person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make small everyday changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create a to do list if need to do something that day&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a more positive outlook on things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"I am 18M and when I was 11-12 I was molested by a boy 3-4 years older than me. I don’t remember the exact age I was for some reason. Same with my dad. He used to hit me, but I can’t remember when it started it when it ended. I remember him becoming my friend and gaining my trust, then one time we were in the lake and we were play fighting and he wrapped his legs around mine and closed them shut so I couldn’t escape and he started touching and grabbing me through my thin soccer shorts that I was wearing as swim shorts at the time. For years I blocked it out and dismissed it as “almost molested,” because he only grabbed my penis once and he didn’t perform any sex acts on me. But lately the memories have come back up and it’s really bothering me. I have had panic attacks after having flashbacks and triggering thoughts. One time my body went numb and I couldn’t control my muscles. I tried to take a drink of water and I just dropped it. If I see anything about child sexual abuse I have to look away and I start hyperventilating. I can’t sleep at night. I have been up past 6 am for over 2 weeks now. I just sit in my phone because I can’t stand being without a distraction. Sometimes I can even feel his legs or his hands again. I can see his smile in my mind when I close my eyes. I feel overwhelming anxiety, embarrassment and shame. All I want to do is sit inside and get away from people. They can’t be trusted. Unless they understand what it’s like, they don’t care. They just tell you to go see a therapist. Like they just pawn you off to be someone else’s problem. They must just not understand how to help and it makes them uncomfortable, but it’s still extremely disheartening. The only support I have really got the has been online. My friends seem to just want to ignore it. It just feels hopeless. What some people do to others, especially children, for their own sick pleasure. Gain a child’s trust just to throw it in their face, and traumatize them for a few seconds of pleasure. I have become extremely introverted since it happened. I avoid intimate and sexual relationships because they are too stressful to even think about. I’ve never had a girlfriend, let alone had sex. I’ve had people tell me that it I might have PTSD, even in other posts I have made on this sub, and I think they are right, but I didn’t really have many of these problems, except for the introversion and avoidance of relationships, before the memories came back in early December.

For years I blocked it out and dismissed it as “almost molested,” because he only grabbed my penis once and he didn’t perform any sex acts on me. But lately the memories have come back up and it’s really bothering me. I have had panic attacks after having flashbacks and triggering thoughts. One time my body went numb and I couldn’t control my muscles. I tried to take a drink of water and I just dropped it. If I see anything about child sexual abuse I have to look away and I start hyperventilating. I can’t sleep at night. I have been up past 6 am for over 2 weeks now. I just sit in my phone because I can’t stand being without a distraction. Sometimes I can even feel his legs or his hands again. I can see his smile in my mind when I close my eyes. I feel overwhelming anxiety, embarrassment and shame. All I want to do is sit inside and get away from people. They can’t be trusted. Unless they understand what it’s like, they don’t care. They just tell you to go see a therapist. Like they just pawn you off to be someone else’s problem. They must just not understand how to help and it makes them uncomfortable, but it’s still extremely disheartening. The only support I have really got the has been online. My friends seem to just want to ignore it. It just feels hopeless. What some people do to others, especially children, for their own sick pleasure. Gain a child’s trust just to throw it in their face, and traumatize them for a few seconds of pleasure. I have become extremely introverted since it happened. I avoid intimate and sexual relationships because they are too stressful to even think about. I’ve never had a girlfriend, let alone had sex. I’ve had people tell me that it I might have PTSD, even in other posts I have made on this sub, and I think they are right, but I didn’t really have many of these problems, except for the introversion and avoidance of relationships, before the memories came back in early December. I read that PTSD symptoms start soon after the trauma, but it’s been 6-7 years. Is this something else? Can PTSD appear years after the traumatic event? Thank you for anyone who replies.&lt;/p&gt;

For some background: I am 21 and female. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, severe anxiety, and BPD. I struggle with suicidal ideation.

My SO thinks inpatient would be good for me. He’s worried about me. He told me he’s scared to leave me alone and feels like he has to ‘babysit’ me or I’ll hurt myself or commit suicide.

,mentalhealth,"I love my job. It's maybe the only thing that gives me a consistent feeling of self-worth, and I'm surrounded by fun and supportive coworkers. It has been keeping me going and I'm extremely grateful. So I don't want to risk losing it or the support of my coworkers, even if the law might protect me to enter a rehab program.

If I felt I really needed to, to turn my life around, **I wondered what my options for short-term inpatient or outpatient (2-6 weeks) treatment for suicidal ideation in New York City, and what I might expect from the program.** It sounds ignorant and I admit I am—I admit I'm driven by a momentary spark of self-care.

That's all, but here is more if someone would be willing to read.

\---

It's been fifteen years since I remember wanting to take my life. I'm 30-something now. I made it this far because of good times with girlfriends and chasing dreams, because of novelties like doing drugs with friends or moving to a new city, and also because of therapy at times and medicine at times. Life always had something new to distract me. But there was never a stretch longer than week I think, that I didn't think about dying. I could never be truly honest with my doctors, and the one time I tried, I was almost committed against my will and about to lose my job and everything—I had to cry and beg to get out of it with a promise that I'd see another doctor the next day.

I always looked for some feeling that felt different one day in my life, anything to latch onto. And right now I feel something like that. I want to try again to find a therapist, despite the exhausting and disappointing process. I want to commit to seeing a psychiatrist regularly and open my mind to any medicine they want to suggest—in a way, I'm ready to submit to them. I want to drink less. All this, not because I care about me, but because I'm sick and tired of making my family and friends and coworkers feel the way I make them feel. Never seeming well, always worried or stressed or tired, everyone having to tiptoe, and closer ones walking on glass. Never being able to commit because I won't know how I'll feel, even the next day. Not replying to texts for days or weeks, and completely having given up on phone calls and emails. Never wanting anything even when they want do so much for me, because ultimately I don't give a damn about myself. Annually cutting communication with everyone and hearing later that they each wondered what they did wrong, when in fact it was my inability to cope with the burden and harm I felt I was to them.

If I *want* to die but still don't have the *will* to die, then *until* I gain the will to die, I want to get better, for all these people I've hurt and I'm going to hurt, wallowing and existing doing no service to anyone. I don't have the capacity to care about myself, but I have some capacity to care for others.

So I thought, aside from just trying all those things—therapists, doctors, medicine, less drinking—and possibly failing and falling back to square one, what can I do this time to really drive it in, really feel like this time it's a real attempt to get better? And I thought, maybe I can prove it to myself by committing to a rehab program, even if it means unpaid leave from my job, and taking it from there.

Maybe none of this is a good idea, I don't know now.

,mentalhealth,"Hi, so basically I just need to rant about this because I feel like I'm completely losing my mind and I have no idea what is wrong with me and nobody seems to understand what I mean, I barely understand what I mean. Basically, I'm 17, I've been on Prozac (40 mg) for about 6 months? I think? I don't even remember when I started. I go to therapy bi-weekly. I feel completely empty and lost. My mental health seems like something that nobody can crack, not even me. I feel invalid and stupid whenever I complain about my mental wellbeing, and I don't know if it's because of metacognition or whatever, I just feel like that I'm self-aware of what's wrong with me it makes me fake. My trauma feels fake, my whole life feels fake and most times I can't remember being so viscerally angry or upset, I kept a trauma journal since my 17th birthday to make sure I remember when I have breakdowns and stuff, for a while I felt like someone was erasing my memory while I was asleep or that my medication erases my memory, and I still believe that now. I just don't feel like I fit into the mental illness box, my boyfriend says I'm not mentally ill and that bad stuff just happened to me, so that makes me feel fake and stupid, but I know he has the best intentions. My therapist just passes it off as anxiety and depression, which I know are serious things but it doesn't feel like anyone in my life takes me seriously. I can't open up about certain things without feeling they're downplayed, or that my traumas weren't severe enough, or that I'm making stuff up. 

Basically, I grew up in a super shitty home, (my therapist confirmed this), the school I go to and my therapist have almost called CPS numerous times. When I was very young (around 3-4) I was diagnosed with PAN and spent 6 months in intensive care. I had most of my intestines removed. I don't remember much about the hospital but my parents say that I was very angry, and I would bite and scream all the time. I don't remember anything about it really. From ages 8-12 I believed I was an angel and that my parents couldn't be my ""real"" parents because my ""real"" parents would never hurt me. I truly believed that the day I turned 12 I would be brought to live in the clouds with my true angel mother who would never hurt me, and that I was on earth to suffer for a little while before I was able to be happy. Of course, that never happened and my delusion completely fell apart as soon as I woke up in the same bed.  When I was 13 I had vivid hallucinations of a ""Ring"" style girl with long black hair ripping out her intestines at the end of my bed. I had flashing images of fucked up faces that were in front of my eyes. I know I wasn't dreaming. I also hallucinated a boy who opened his mouth full of teeth and he ate me. I didn't sleep that night and cried on the floor. I had hallucinations outside the next day of a giant furry creature with huge teeth. There were other things. Those hallucinations only lasted 3 days before I think things went back to normal and I no longer had visual hallucinations or auditory ones. At least none that I can remember. I also have extreme apathy about my family, I feel no love towards them whatsoever. When I was 12 I prayed every day that my parents would die in a car crash. I always fantasized about a ""Sucker Punch"" style revenge where I would kill them all and get to be free. I hoped a lot that my family would die and I could escape. I've never acted on those thoughts of course, but they've been extremely present and intrusive throughout my whole life. My freshmen year of high school I was sexually assaulted, the school did nothing, they knew about it, the kid wasn't even punished. It wasn't that bad, just unwanted groping so I didn't even have it bad. I have vivid nightmares about being raped almost every week, often 2 or 3 nights in a row. They're extremely lucid, not that I can do anything but that I can feel everything happening. They're often violent and I am scared to go to sleep sometimes. I believed I was being raped while I slept by my father or a demon but I can acknowledge that that's a ridiculous thing to believe. I've had a few suicide attempts but I've never been hospitalized. 

That's about all I can remember. That's all my mental stuff thrown out there. I don't know. Most times I feel extremely fake. I feel like I am empty and blank all the time. I feel like I don't know who I am, that I can't even rely on myself to judge my self-concept. Sometimes I feel like just anxiety and depression doesn't explain it all, and that nobody is taking me seriously. I don't know what to tell my therapist, because whenever I go into his office I am suddenly fine and in a good mood. I write stuff down in my trauma journal or in my phone but I can't work up the courage to talk about it. I don't know what to do. I feel like I am about to snap. The best way I can put it is that my foundation is infested in termites, and there are so many holes and pieces rotting and being eaten away, but everyone has just put a gloss over it and pretends like that's enough even though the termites still chew away at it. I feel like I'm on a stack of cards built on top of that gloss, and at any second the foundation will fall away. I feel like a blanket is being pulled over my head and I'm suffocating. I just don't know what to do. I should be grateful that I'm on medication and have therapy but I just don't feel like my needs are being met. I know that's selfish to say but some things don't add up. Recently I've missed a lot of days for my meds, but on those days at least I feel like myself again, I feel like a person instead of a husk. I just don't know what's wrong with me, if I'm being ungrateful and unreasonable or if something really is wrong.

,mentalhealth,"Hey yall,

\#ReportSurvival is an initiative to share real life survivor stories, give the hopeless hope, and help end suicide contagion. Right now we're looking for people who have stories that they'd be willing to share. If you or someone you know does, we'd love to hear from ya! Also, if you have feedback on the proposal below we welcome your comments.

All the best,

The #ReportSurvival team

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE?**

***The news is killing people.***

When we lost Robin Williams the suicide rate increased by 10%. Marilyn Monroe: 12%. When Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain committed suicide, the hotline got 25% more calls. It's called *suicide contagion,* and it’s the proven link between mass media coverage of suicide and an increase in suicide rates.

Think about it. If a celebrity with more resources and success couldn’t beat it, how can anyone? It makes you feel hopeless. And hopelessness can be deadly.

With suicide rates increasing across the world, we have to do something now more than ever. Something unprecedented. We have to tell the other side of the story. Where people survive and thrive. We have to #ReportSurvival.

***#ReportSurvival***\*\*?\*\*

\#ReportSurvival is a campaign guiding news organizations to report suicide more responsibly. Whether it’s Buzzfeed, the local news, or CNN, we’ll create a media landscape where a story of someone who survived suicide follows every report of someone who didn't.

**WHY SURVIVOR STORIES?**

***Why survivor stories?***

For every person that dies by suicide, another 280 people survive. Many of whom go on to live happy, fulfilling lives. These stories of survival and perseverance hold extraordinary power. That's why they're an effective way to end suicide contagion. But don't take it from us, take it from them:

“Portraying suicide survivors rather than focusing on completed cases in the media is more effective in reducing suicide contagion.”

* *Madelyn Gould, professor of clinical epidemiology at Columbia University and expert in youth suicide*

“Our best answers as to why suicides happen and what we can do to prevent them are not found by focusing on the one person who died by suicide, but by focusing on the living—the other 280 who survived.”

* *John Draper, Ph.D., executive director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline*

“It turns out that, although suicide can be contagious, resilience can also be contagious. And when we look at media reports that talk about people who thought about suicide but instead got help and got better, that actually rates across the population, the number of deaths that happen in a specific area, go down. And we really really want to encourage people to report in that kind of way.”

* *Mark Sinyor, M.D., Clinical Researcher and Professor at the University of Toronto*

“Hearing stories from people who have survived suicide attempts is an important step in suicide prevention.”

* *Professor Patrick McGorry, former Australian of the Year for his services to youth mental health*

“Their stories are not only enlightening professionals who create policies or study the subject, but they are also transmitting all important hope to those at risk.""

* *Center for Suicide Prevention*

""People see stories all the time about those surviving breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke, and we know what that recovery looks like—it helps people who are experiencing it or someone whose mom just got diagnosed. So many people go through their suicidal crisis feeling completely isolated and alone because they think they're the only ones. But they're not. There are millions of healing and recovery stories—they just haven't been shared.""

* *Shelby Rowe, a youth suicide prevention program manager for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services*

***Don’t survivor stories already exist?***

When was the last time you saw an uplifting news story about someone who overcame suicide? Unfortunately, it’s human nature to take an interest in conflict, drama, and tragedy. As a result, the few survivor stories that are independently produced are unpromoted and low quality.

Of the content that does exist, ours will be different in several crucial ways:

1. ***Relevance*** \- Instead of one or two, we’ll feature 20 unique stories. This ensures every sufferer, no matter their experience, has something they can relate to.
2. ***Quality*** \- We’ve worked with award-winning production companies, many of whom are interested in pro-bono work. That means we’ll have the best equipment, crews, and directors to deliver quality films that distinguish our stories and engage our viewers.
3. ***Compelling Content*** \- We’ve learned storytelling at some of the world’s most renown advertising agencies and news organizations. Given our experience, we’re confident we can create films that are enthralling, concise, and effective.
4. ***Understanding*** *–* We understand these issues because we’ve been victims of them. Whether it’s suicide, suicide contagion, or depression, the videos we’re creating are films we wish existed when we felt lost and hopeless.
5. ***Casting*** \- Finding the right people is essential. Without a good story, we don’t have a film worth making. That’s why we won’t proceed until we’re completely satisfied.
6. ***Link to Treatment*** \- This is about more than hope. It’s about action and lasting change. That’s why we’re putting emphasis on how suicide survivors got through it, giving concrete examples of how others can too. Each film will link to treatment options and affordable resources to help people take the next step and get the help they so desperately need.

**HOW WILL THIS WORK?**

For this to work, we need news organizations to see these survivor stories and make a commitment to #ReportSurvival. Here’s why it will happen:

1. ***It’s nothing new:*** Media guidelines for how to report suicide already exist. The most effective being the suicide prevention hotline. Problem is, suicide contagion is only getting worse. This makes #ReportSurvival a simple, yet essential evolution of these guidelines.
2. ***We made it simple:*** We'll make the survivor films ourselves. All they’ll have to do is link to the film. That's one line of text alongside the suicide prevention hotline number. It’s that easy.
3. ***Broadcast quality:*** Our films will be as compelling and well produced as any broadcast segment.
4. ***Variety:*** With 20 different films, news outlets won’t have to worry about covering the same story.
5. ***Pre-launch partnership:*** We’ll partner with a news organization beforehand. When we launch they'll pledge to #ReportSurvival, which ensures others will follow.
6. ***PR:*** A well-executed PR plan is essential. In the absence of one, our survivor stories will get lost in a clutter of internet content. Our experience pitching blogs and acquiring earned media will ensure people and news organizations won’t miss our efforts.
7. ***Legitimacy:*** Along the way, we'll get endorsements from mental health organizations like NAMI and influencers like Michael Phelps.
8. ***They already care:*** Unlike the rest of the world, reporters are well aware of suicide contagion. #ReportSurvival is a chance for them to help end a life or death issue they’re painfully aware of.

With that, let’s go over how this works executionally.

1. ***Pre-Launch: The Stories***

***Casting***

First things first. We’ll partner with a casting agency to help us find the most moving survivor stories. At the same time, we’ll tap into our own networks to cast an even wider net.

***Production***

To ensure viewers have a story they can relate to, we'll produce 20 films. Each will represent a different gender, sexuality, race, age, trauma, or treatment. That means 300 million people who’re suffering from depression will finally have access to stories they can relate to.

***Partnerships***

The more help we can get the better. Whether it’s non-profits with funding, individuals with feedback, or production partners with time and equipment, we’ll take whatever we can get.

2) ***Pre-Launch: #ReportSurvival***

***Influencers***

Although it’s not essential, influencers have helped spark some of the most successful social movements in the digital age. Movements like #MeToo, Obama’s “Change” campaign, and the Ice Bucket Challenge dominated the internet because of influencer support.

Given this issue's importance, our connections, and how unaware people are, we believe we can recruit some of the world’s most influential people. Celebrities with their own survivor stories in all areas of life. Oprah, Michael Phelps, Ted Turner, Prince Harry, and J.K. Rowling are just a few examples of influencers who are just as passionate as we are.

***Bring on the News***

As proven with the existing suicide guidelines when one news organization commits to change, the rest join. Doesn’t matter if it’s Fox News or MSNBC, they all want to help end suicide contagion. So as we previously mentioned, we’ll partner with an organization beforehand.

3) ***Launch***

***Wait for it***

Every high profile suicide has lead to record-breaking global awareness, but very little action or change. By launching our campaign in reaction to the next widely publicized high profile suicide, we’ll turn awareness into action.

**WHO ARE WE?**

***I’m Tim***

I spent the last 6 years working at Ogilvy &amp; Mather. While there, I executed campaigns for American Express, British Airways, Coke Zero, ThinkPad, and Qualcomm.

I know what it's like to feel hopeless. I know suicide contagion exists because I was almost a victim of it. And I know how discouraging it is to see countless stories of people who gave up, but none of the people who beat it.

That’s why this isn’t something I *want* to do. This is something I *will do*.

***The Agency***

My digital media company GUSH specializes in social media campaigns and PR-worthy executions. Part of our business is applying our digital, social, and PR skills to end the mental health crisis.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We made it simple:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;ll make the survivor films ourselves. All they’ll have to do is link to the film. That&amp;#39;s one line of text alongside the suicide prevention hotline number. It’s that easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broadcast quality:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Our films will be as compelling and well produced as any broadcast segment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; With 20 different films, news outlets won’t have to worry about covering the same story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pre-launch partnership:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll partner with a news organization beforehand. When we launch they&amp;#39;ll pledge to #ReportSurvival, which ensures others will follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;PR:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A well-executed PR plan is essential. In the absence of one, our survivor stories will get lost in a clutter of internet content. Our experience pitching blogs and acquiring earned media will ensure people and news organizations won’t miss our efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legitimacy:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Along the way, we&amp;#39;ll get endorsements from mental health organizations like NAMI and influencers like Michael Phelps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;They already care:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike the rest of the world, reporters are well aware of suicide contagion. #ReportSurvival is a chance for them to help end a life or death issue they’re painfully aware of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, let’s go over how this works executionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pre-Launch: The Stories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Casting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first. We’ll partner with a casting agency to help us find the most moving survivor stories. At the same time, we’ll tap into our own networks to cast an even wider net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure viewers have a story they can relate to, we&amp;#39;ll produce 20 films. Each will represent a different gender, sexuality, race, age, trauma, or treatment. That means 300 million people who’re suffering from depression will finally have access to stories they can relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partnerships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more help we can get the better. Whether it’s non-profits with funding, individuals with feedback, or production partners with time and equipment, we’ll take whatever we can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pre-Launch: #ReportSurvival&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Influencers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it’s not essential, influencers have helped spark some of the most successful social movements in the digital age. Movements like #MeToo, Obama’s “Change” campaign, and the Ice Bucket Challenge dominated the internet because of influencer support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this issue&amp;#39;s importance, our connections, and how unaware people are, we believe we can recruit some of the world’s most influential people. Celebrities with their own survivor stories in all areas of life. Oprah, Michael Phelps, Ted Turner, Prince Harry, and J.K. Rowling are just a few examples of influencers who are just as passionate as we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bring on the News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As proven with the existing suicide guidelines when one news organization commits to change, the rest join. Doesn’t matter if it’s Fox News or MSNBC, they all want to help end suicide contagion. So as we previously mentioned, we’ll partner with an organization beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Launch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait for it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every high profile suicide has lead to record-breaking global awareness, but very little action or change. By launching our campaign in reaction to the next widely publicized high profile suicide, we’ll turn awareness into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO ARE WE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m Tim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the last 6 years working at Ogilvy &amp;amp; Mather. While there, I executed campaigns for American Express, British Airways, Coke Zero, ThinkPad, and Qualcomm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what it&amp;#39;s like to feel hopeless. I know suicide contagion exists because I was almost a victim of it. And I know how discouraging it is to see countless stories of people who gave up, but none of the people who beat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why this isn’t something I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do. This is something I &lt;em&gt;will do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Agency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My digital media company GUSH specializes in social media campaigns and PR-worthy executions. Part of our business is applying our digital, social, and PR skills to end the mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO YOU HAVE A STORY?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d love to hear it and potentially feature it to help launch this initi1ative.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Hi there,

I'm 26 and married (for now at least). 

I've been dating my now wife for about 10 years now. About a year ago I became addicted to alcohol. A short time after that I started compulsively lying about everything, big or small. From getting promotions at work, to being in a car accident, to what time I would come home from work. 

I recently got discovered, and naturally my wife is furious. 

I'm going to my first AA meeting later tonight, and I'm starting therapy that specializes in sexual abuse later this week. 

The worst part is that I feel very little emotion or remorse. I don't know if I'm in shock or just apathetic and depressed. But it's really hard for me feel right now. And that makes me want to drink again and end my massive 12 hours of sobriety already.

Now that have the good part out of the way, I want to highlight some habits and mindsets I currently have and how I feel like they prevent me from doing more.

-I'm a huge nerd. Now there's nothing wrong with that, but my whole life I've spent consuming entertainment. I'm always making lists of movies, comics, anime, music, video games, shows to consume and the majority of my free time goes into those.

-I used to be pretty creative as a kid and drew everyday. I think discovering the internet, this whole other world of overabundance in entertainment, really fcked me up. And I have no doubt discovering porn killed a lot of motivation I had for healthier activities.

-I have this habit of thinking ""Oh, I might try this and that out and turn it into a legit hobby and if I'm lucky enough, a career out of it"" I can't count the number of times I've started this only to quit within a few days. Basically things that aren't required, but challenge me, I end up quitting. And these are things my other friend does with no hesitation and things you would think I would be interested in(trailer editing, music production, writing film reviews, web designing for a blog where I could talk about my interests).

Now I've never been diagnosed with any of the above mental conditions and I think if I did, I'm not at a severe level. Since being a kid, I moved around a lot and never really fit into any group. I 've always been introverted and didn't like sports except when I did track in HS, which I actually kinda excelled at. I scored somewhat in neuroticism in the big 5 psychology test to no surprise, I've always been socially anxious and the feared talking with people and in front of the room. I feel like I've ruined dates on online dating by having doubts and not being able to keep my cool. I'm always scared of not being able to get along or impress someone and this is due to lack of inner confidence than looks, the lack of grounded confidence is what kills opportunities with other people. I have had a few bouts of depression here and there but I would say mostly triggered from life events. Although these bouts caused me to be more introspective and become sad about the things I was not achieving.

Should I seek therapy/medication? Or avoid that road and just meditate re-attempt certain activities and see where that takes me?

,mentalhealth,"After 25 years of marriage, and three (grown to almost grown) children, my high functioning wife has had a complete mental breakdown.

It relates to a career decision she made that backfired, and cost her some salary/prestige.  The amount of the salary cut she took, and the cost of being out of work for a while, is in an isolated number if I typed it out, sounds meaningful.  However, in the context of our overall current financial situation (savings, my income, her income potential, etc), it is at most, a slight inconvenience.  In the context of our overall life and plan, it is barely a blip.  We have spent at least half our marriage in a much more challenging financial situation.

However, she has absolutely collapsed mentally and emotionally in the past six months.  She is incapable of any conversation that isn't a variation of:

\-wanting to wake up from the nightmare/go back in time

\-She's ruined our lives

\-Everything is lost and is all over

She cannot and will not enjoy anything in life, including time with her children.  She will not participate in anything she previously did for household or for enjoyment. She's broken off her friend group.  She mainly just paces, and babbles the same things over and over.  She's basically becoming agoraphobic and can't interact with anyone...the trajectory is that she will not be attending our childrens' graduations, weddings, etc.

She, and our children have been begging her to see someone for months, and she's a hard refusal.  Her opinion is that it's too late, and a therapist can't do anything because they don't have a time machine.  The damage has been done, and there's nothing they can do or say to help, it's all over and we're ruined, and our children's futures are ruined.  She refuses to even look at financial numbers, budgets, etc that show otherwise, she's set her mind that we're going bankrupt, going to lose the house, etc...anything I try to explain why we are fine financially is ""you don't know, you don't know, it's over.""

She does not want to get better, does not believe there is any future, any possibility of any hope for the future.  Here only context to discuss things being better is that we can go back in time and she not leave the job she had.  That's where it begins and ends, she will not consider anything moving forward.

I don't have any mental health experience, so I don't want to armchair diagnose...it seems like depression, obsessive thinking, anxiety, delusion...anything and everything.  It's basically the type of state I would expect someone to be in from losing a child, or more specifically, accidentally causing the death of a child.  She's that level of distraught, all the time, without relief, and it's been going on for months.

Is there anything that can be done when someone flat out refuses help or any effort to get better?  Or are our lives ruined, and this just something I live with and try to keep things together as long as I can before it all falls apart?  Everything I read online about supporting someone with mental illness presupposes that they want to get better, at least in some moments of clarity, but there isn't one second of the last six months, despite encouraging, begging, crying, screaming, threatening, etc where she has given an inch, even the slightest consideration, to wanting to get better or to see a therapist.

,mentalhealth,"I've been with my boyfriend more than 5 years. He's always had a bit of a temper, but nothing extreme enough to worry about. In the past two years I've noticed some changes in his behaviour that really worry me. (He is in his late 20s - early 30s) He's been engaging in more and more generally reckless behavior, has started to become enraged over even the tiniest things, he has threatened me in fits of anger and I have felt unsafe, is over-exaggerating everything and saying things  then swearing 100% that he never said it, decreased empathy and an emergence of extreme selfishness, constant irritability, extremely low self-esteem, he's paranoid that everyone hates him all the time, constantly unsure of what he wants/likes, says he feels empty all the time, talks about how nobody would miss him if he died and says he'll just jump in front of a bus/train etc but swears he's just joking when I ask him about it later, gets upset/clingy/needy when I'm away from him and also has panic attacks, cannot sleep unless I'm next to him.  + more.

,mentalhealth,"Hello, just to get this out of the way, I'm a 24-year-old guy.  I still live at home with my parents.  

There are alot of sentences that start with ""I"" so be warned haha.  

These last 4 months, I have been on a downward spiral.  I'm taking antidepressants but they don't do anything.  So I've resulted to addictions to energy drinks and fast food.  I don't go a day without fast food.  I'm starting to drink 2 energy drinks per day.  I woke up this morning and after 2 hours of being awake, I laid on my bed and was out for another 40 minutes.  I went to bed at a decent time last night too. This has become more and more common.  

I don't have any real friends.  I do get along with people at work just fine and I sorta talk to people at my church but not really.  As a result, I spend a ton of time by myself and it's starting to eat on me.  I feel my skills of making and keeping conversations are rapidly fading.  On top of this, I gradually find it more and more difficult to even start a conversation with someone.  

Recently I decided to get a Nintendo switch.  I bought it for a few reasons, but here are 2 big ones.  

Reason No. 1. 

I don't have any hobbies or interests.  So I thought that a switch would be good for me.  Sadly, I find that I have to force myself to play video games.  I do enjoy them, but not as much as I want to....this really saddens me.  

Reason No. 2

I really want to fit in.  I want to be able to be apart of conversations about video games and all that stuff.  It's broader in my mind, but this is the best I can put it.  

So yeah, there are my reasons.  I'm not sure if talking about this was all that important, but I thought it was a little, so I included it.  

Every so often, I get these hours where I am very happy and energetic.  It seems to come out of nowhere.  I notice that I get more talkative around my family and I feel pretty happy.  But those hours aren't many.  I'd say for every 96 hours, maybe 15 of them (not in a row but spread across the 96 hour period) I feel those ""happy"" hours.   The rest of the time I'm quiet, anti-social, and tired.  

Now you might say that I need to exercise.  And you are right, I do need it.  But I have lost the desire to do so.  Since 2017, I've gained 40 pounds.  I promised myself that I wouldn't go over 200, but that promise went out the window long ago.  I just don't care anymore.  

I feel stuck.  I'm like a car stuck in the mud and won't come out.

,mentalhealth,"I've always felt a bit off. I didn't have a so called ""bad"" childhood. I didn't really get bullied either since I am a pretty self critical person. Never have I felt that there's something wrong with myself. I don't really see the bad things in myself as bad things. 

I always had these periods when I'm really depressed about things. Not as in I feel bad about myself or really anything. More like just being bored of reality and existence. It's a kinda melancholic feeling. This last year it got worse, maybe because I've had so much stress about things that are not really relevant. I feel like I exist but not really, like I'm not myself. I feel like Plankton controlling SpongeBob but i am Plankton and SpongeBob.

I don't feel like the world has flaws. I'm not depressed about the situation of the world. I don't stress about my bad habits, my looks or anything like that. In fact I'm really happy with myself as i am. I just feel like nothing is in place in a kind of cosmic level (Not like religiously but you get it.) 

In my early teenage years I did some selfharm but I feel like it was just some teen angst thing so i would get attention. Though lately I got a huge urge to hurt myself and to know what death feels like so I started burning myself with cigarettes. It's not that i don't like myself, not even that it's a way to ""feel at least something"". Now that i have these burns over my arms it just feels like I want more of that adrenaline feeling. 

If I could be reborn infinite times, I'd shoot myself with a shotgun until I finally die permanently.  
I don't feel suicidal I feel it's more like masochism but in a non-sexual way.

I crave everything but nothing is made for me. I feel like I'm drifting through time but it's okay, its alright. Everything in my life is starting to go off the road but it's not like I'd care about that. I sleep whenever and wake up whenever. One week I go to sleep very very early. Sometimes I sleep once every two days, sometimes even once every three days. Sometimes i almost sleep the whole weekend. At first it didn't really affect my studying but now it starts to. 

I am not from this planet. Or so I feel like. I observe life around me and try to learn everything about it but it's getting hard since every day i feel like i watch the world through more and more dirty blurry lenses. I feel like i'm sinking into my own head but it doesn't feel bad. In all honesty i am a very anxious person. Maybe it's just my personality or maybe i have a disorder. 

After all i don't really care, None of this feels bad. None of this is an obstacle for my mind but more for the progress of my life. If i was the one choosing i would never do anything.  
The thing that really gets to me is how everyone around me keeps telling me that ""That's life, you can't always just get what you want"". 

Why do i have to get a stable job to get money to pay my bills. Why do i have to be like this and that. I understand that i CAN be myself and i CAN be expressive of my own style and all that and i am that.  
Truthfully no one can be themselves. Yeah you can wear the clothes you like or listen to your own preferred music but after all you are just going to have to grow to be a normal job going, bill paying, social rules following man/woman who is a prisoner of themselves and the system.

I really understand the importance of all the kinds of systems and such to keep order i feel like there's really no other way to keep the world up. 

I love Earth. Nature is beautiful. Humans are beautiful. How we got here, how we have learned so much about things and how we keep building and manipulating everything around us is in my eyes so beautiful. We know so much about everything, there's good people and bad people. Sometimes we need bad people for balance. I don't see tech as a bad thing i think it's just awesome how humankind has gotten this far. We are living the future. I wouldn't change a thing in this world. 

I just wish i could only keep observing this world. I wish someone would build a small pod with eyes and transfer my brain in it so i could just keep observing life around me.

I feel out of place in this world and in my body but i don't want out. I know there's no way out. I know the consequences of me ending it for myself. People would be sad i'm sure. My family would never stop grieving after me. And to be honest i don't even want to end it. Like i said i love the world we live in.

,mentalhealth,"Hello everybody!  First post on this sub and I'm happy to meet you all!

Not sure if this is the right sub for this though.

Just wanted to get something off my chest: I (27M) noticed I unwillingly ""dive"" into various scenarios when something positive happens to me.  Say for example I add or talk to a girl I like on Facebook.  I feel very happy doing that which makes sense.  However, what I don't like is that my mind jumps to imagining how I would react if I met her parents or how might I take a flight to go visit her (for example if she lives far away).  Or say I go to the gym and do a 10k run and the time is better than last time - which is great!  But then my mind jumps again to a scenario in which I've trained hard for like a year and I'm like super fit and can *always* beat this time - so the first time I'm slower (because tired or whatever reason), the whole thing collapses and I don't feel motivated at all.

I'm thinking It's like my mind extrapolates from a little good thing into this grandiose fantasy and the scary thing is I noticed I need to consciously re-focus else I can end up indulging in the fantasy for a long time.

What I noticed happening in the past is that these fantasies almost never come true - I've even said to myself once that anything that I fantasize about won't come true, so if I want something, I shouldn't fantasize about it.  Still, I don't always notice and what happens is I spend a lot of time thinking about ""how things great would be if X"" but as soon as X doesn't happen then I feel demoralized and depressed.

They were my main source of food and shelter and were willing to physically hurt and verbally berate me.\n\nAs an adult, I got the ability to challenge my parents on their beliefs and behaviors because I now had financial freedom plus the benefit of now longer being subjugated to their physical strength.\n\nInitially, when I told my parents that hitting children is evil, they looked sorry and they spouted seemingly apologetic words. Over the course of a month or two, I was able to gather information from our conversations and figured out whether they were truly sorry or if they were only trying to manipulate me into compliance and belief without proof.\n\n*Distraction*, *Excuses*, and *Avoidance*\n\n   1. When I told my father that being hit by him as a child made me extremely sad, his reply was, ""My father hit me too; it\'s something I learned from my father. My childhood was a lot worse than yours"".\n\nHere, I was telling my dad something very honest and emotional and he dismissed my emotions and started talking about his own life. Also, he didn\'t take responsibility for hitting me and he didn\'t say he was sorry for hitting me.\n\n   2. I was telling my mom about the fact that I hated being a bully. I asked her about why she let my behave in such a crude and forceful manner. Her reply was, ""I would have never let you do that because I was bullied when I was a child.""\n\nHere, my mom blatantly lied because I was a bully and she knew I was a bully. Similar to my dad, she puts the focus of the conversation on herself by talking about her own experience with bullies instead of asking me about my experience and she did not apologize for not teaching me peaceful negotiation.\n\n   3. On one occasion, my entire family was in the room and I started talking about being hit, yet again. My mom immediately stood up and said, ""AGAIN? We\'ve already talked about this. I want to talk about something else.""\n\nHere, my mom was revealing clear signs of unempathetic disinterest. She didn\'t care about what I had to say and she valued her own preference to avoid conversation more than my desire to speak about it. She knew this was important to me but she felt uncomfortable and so she tried to avoid the conversation by trying to silent me.

Over the course of a month or two, I was able to gather information from our conversations and figured out whether they were truly sorry or if they were only trying to manipulate me into compliance and belief without proof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Distraction&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Excuses&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Avoidance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When I told my father that being hit by him as a child made me extremely sad, his reply was, &amp;quot;My father hit me too; it&amp;#39;s something I learned from my father.

She didn&amp;#39;t care about what I had to say and she valued her own preference to avoid conversation more than my desire to speak about it. She knew this was important to me but she felt uncomfortable and so she tried to avoid the conversation by trying to silent me.

,mentalhealth,"I posted a few days ago about severe social anxiety/agoraphobia, but a friend said that it sounds like I have PTSD, which may have resulted in everything else over time.

In short: I was bullied severely (""bullied."" It was abuse). I was stabbed in the arm at one point and had my arm pulled out of it's socket on one occasion resulting in a cast for about 6-8 weeks. I turned into an alcoholic just to make it through high school, and I survived with my emotions buried for years. Then, once I stopped drinking, I found I had all this unresolved rage/emotional distress. For the past 7 years, I've both struggled to remember the specifics of the events, but also had moments of total clarity, that I can only describe as watching a movie of my worst moments with surround sound. Sometimes I get pulled in unwillingly, and other times it's more like a daydream that I can break out of if I try. There's also a certain type of person that ""triggers"" me, (very ""laddish/broish"" straight men) as they remind me of the worst of the abusers. I have a lot of rage/negativity toward these types of people, although I don't know them, and I often exit places they're present because I'm seconds away from a panic attack.

,mentalhealth,"GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

,mentalhealth,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but if not, feel free to point me in the right direction. I'm a 29 (close to 30) year old white man living in the USA, I'm on testosterone replacement therapy, I drink 2-3 times a month with friends, and I smoke cannabis 1-2 times a month to help with occasional sleep issues because my TRT makes me very amped up. I quit smoking about two years ago, and now I smoke Juul (nicotine) daily. Other than that I have never taken any drugs with the exception of the occasional multivitamin.

Long story short, I can't think creatively. I've always been a very concrete/rigid thinker. For example, it's always been difficult for me to understand things like improv comedy or musical 'jam sessions' that don't involve following sheet music, or cooking that doesn't involve following a recipe or guide. I've been this way as long as I can remember. However, up until I was about 22 I was a musician and also an artist, and while it was difficult for me to create new works, I pushed past the mental blocks and was able to complete dozens of long-term projects.

When I was 21 I had a major psychotic break from stress, that lasted about two months, and there were lingering effects from it for several months afterward. About six months after my psychotic break I realized I couldn't write music anymore, and creating art was very difficult for me unless I was copying someone else's style. I have no idea if that was related, I asked my therapist and my dad and both said losing your creative streak is just something that happens when you get older. I haven't had any issues related to psychosis since then, but my wife is concerned that the stress I was under in that two month period fried my ability to think creatively, and that I may need to re-learn how to think, as if I were a baby that never learned it in the first place. I'm not sure if that's how brains work, but at this point I'd be willing to try anything.

For the past six or seven years it's been extreme. I can't drive anywhere unless I have a destination in mind (so 'just going for a drive' gives me excessive anxiety unless I plan out several destinations). I can't 'get creative' in bed, I can only perform actions I've seen other people do (either in porn or otherwise). I can't make certain foods even though I'm physically capable of doing so, because I have a mental block in place saying it's not possible. I'm in school for Computer Science and it's borderline impossible for me because most of CS is solving puzzles that haven't been solved before, and I can't visualize solutions for things if I've never seen the solution before.

I can't make playlists, write music or make art, be spontaneous, be romantic, or do anything that requires coming up with a new idea. I was never really any good at most of those things to begin with, but prior to age 22ish I could at least try and while it was difficult, I'd usually get at least part of it right. A couple months ago one of my friends asked me to sit in on a game of charades and I had an embarrassing breakdown because when it was my turn I couldn't think of anything that hadn't been played already. It's not just absent-mindedness, it's more like I see absolutely nothing in my 'mind's eye'.

This is really affecting my relationship with my wife because she's tired of being the person who always has to do the thinking, and it's affecting my ability to form friendships and enjoy life, and I'm curious as to what kind of doctor I should see or if anyone else has this issue.",t2_559ihcnx,False,,0,False,"I am unable to think creatively in any way, and my wife is incredibly concerned I've fried my brain in some way.

I have no idea if that was related, I asked my therapist and my dad and both said losing your creative streak is just something that happens when you get older. I haven&amp;#39;t had any issues related to psychosis since then, but my wife is concerned that the stress I was under in that two month period fried my ability to think creatively, and that I may need to re-learn how to think, as if I were a baby that never learned it in the first place. I&amp;#39;m not sure if that&amp;#39;s how brains work, but at this point I&amp;#39;d be willing to try anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past six or seven years it&amp;#39;s been extreme. I can&amp;#39;t drive anywhere unless I have a destination in mind (so &amp;#39;just going for a drive&amp;#39; gives me excessive anxiety unless I plan out several destinations). I can&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;get creative&amp;#39; in bed, I can only perform actions I&amp;#39;ve seen other people do (either in porn or otherwise). I can&amp;#39;t make certain foods even though I&amp;#39;m physically capable of doing so, because I have a mental block in place saying it&amp;#39;s not possible. I&amp;#39;m in school for Computer Science and it&amp;#39;s borderline impossible for me because most of CS is solving puzzles that haven&amp;#39;t been solved before, and I can&amp;#39;t visualize solutions for things if I&amp;#39;ve never seen the solution before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t make playlists, write music or make art, be spontaneous, be romantic, or do anything that requires coming up with a new idea. I was never really any good at most of those things to begin with, but prior to age 22ish I could at least try and while it was difficult, I&amp;#39;d usually get at least part of it right. A couple months ago one of my friends asked me to sit in on a game of charades and I had an embarrassing breakdown because when it was my turn I couldn&amp;#39;t think of anything that hadn&amp;#39;t been played already. It&amp;#39;s not just absent-mindedness, it&amp;#39;s more like I see absolutely nothing in my &amp;#39;mind&amp;#39;s eye&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really affecting my relationship with my wife because she&amp;#39;s tired of being the person who always has to do the thinking, and it&amp;#39;s affecting my ability to form friendships and enjoy life, and I&amp;#39;m curious as to what kind of doctor I should see or if anyone else has this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a history of psych admissions and was taken out of high school to be hospitalized. I graduated through a tutor that was sent to my bed on the unit and later to my house. A year and a half later, I was stable enough to accept my place at university! It was exciting to be independent and I managed a 3.93 first semester, but we're one week into second semester and I can already tell this isn't going to be easy.

,mentalhealth,"This year I started Uni and I've been having trouble concentrating on school when I'm studying. Like, not getting distracted by my phone, sounds, everything really.  
My old psychologist from when I as 12 thought I might have ADD but then when she heard how well I did in school she digressed.   
My best friend has ADD and she said it wouldn't be a big surprise if I did have ADD (and she knows me very well).  
Every only test I fill out it says there's a big fat chance I have ADD.  
This was not the case with the test I filled out at the doctors office. This was kind of like a pre-test. But when I filled that one out with half of the questions I just didn't really know what the right answers were. I thought I wasn't that often distracted, just with school, but then my parents were like 'sweetheart remember this and this and this and this and this?' and I realized that yes, I do get distracted a lot. So the test wasn't totally accurate. And I only needed about 2 or 3 points more to possibly have ADD.  
So I wanted to redo the test. And my parents even want me to get officially tested, since ADD also runs in the family and it's just nice to know whether I can rule ADD out or not.   
But when I asked my doctor about it, he said 'You need three things to have ADD. Impulsivity, distractedness and something else (I don't remember). You only have one of them so you most probably don't have it and it's gonna be a waste of money.' Even though impulsivity is part of ADHD and distinguishes ADHD from ADD. It's like he had no idea what he was talking about. And he was like 'Why would you need a label? What are you gonna do when you get a label? Just take medicine?' and I was like 'Well... I mean if it helps me... Sure? And I want the label because I want to know.'' 'But why not just work on your problem of distractedness? You don't need the label.'' ANd in my head I was like 'Well.. if you know it's because of ADD you might have a better way to treat it?' but I didn't say that because social anxiety and it seemed as if he refused to give me the test (which turns out wasn't the case, he was just trying to be reasonable and wanted me to think it through).  


And then last time at the doctors office with the lady I regularly talk to (kind of therapist-like but not really) she asked about my recent grades, and I boasted that I got only one 7 out of 10 and an 8, 9, and 8.5, and she immidiately was like 'see this is why I think you probably dont have ADD. People with ADD usually don't do this well in school.' and I immidiately told her that my other friend has ADD, she studied way less than me (I study about 6 hours a day just summarising everything, and like all through the semester, not just right before the exams and my friend only studied about a five days leading up to the exams, with only summaries from the internet) and I got an 8 and she mostly got 6's. So I was like 'Well my friend has ADD but she also did very well'.  
'That's because ADD is different for everyone'. And I wanted to straight up yell at her and tell her 'Yeah well MAYBE ITS LIKE THAT WITH ME TOO?' Plus apperently (so I've read) women with ADD ofteb manage to hide it well and can still do well in school. So I was like 'Woman you're a sweetheart but you have no idea what the F you're talking about'. Didn't say that out loud. But I thought it.

I did get a referance after all though because 'if this is really what you want (sneaky headshake) I will write you a note to get tested'.

,mentalhealth,"So this weekend a casual get together with friends went completely sideways. We had all been drinking, and only one witness. Shit happened so fast, I believe we were all truly floored. The friend who witnessed the blow out, initially told all that I initiated it. This was not the case, and she confirmed that to my husband the following day.

My ""friend"" innocently enough put her hands around my face and lovingly told me to stop making everything she says out to be negative. We had a recent disagreement that we decided not to discuss and just move forward. So when she started this talk, it immediately triggered me. But she followed it up with getting in my face and screaming at me that she never wanted to hear a particular word ever come out of my mouth again...Bipolar.

A couple weeks ago, I briefly explained that I had just been diagnosed, and was struggling with feeling shame. Told her I was learning a new vocabulary and still getting the gist of it. It wasn't really discussed beyond that, or again since.

This ""friend"" isn't the type to allow others to speak much...but I'm sure I muttered a statement or so back about moving forward, but that she didn't get a pass to tear me down...that we obviously need to resolve it another time...

She continued screaming accusing me of lying about having cancer (stage 4 breast cancer, thriving 3 years now)....and it went to hell in a handbasket after that. I initially tried to tell her that we weren't going to do this now...but I readily defended myself after that.

We managed to pull it together, offer brief apologies, and left abruptly.  Thought it was done. Pretty much felt confident that a parting of ways was in order, but didn't need it to be a big deal.

The next day she gave my number to one of her friends, which initiated a group chat stirring a ton of drama. My husband was included. The sticking point here is this woman and my husband have been close friends for a number of years. The group texts blew up our phones with 43 messages over two hours. Their mission was to try to expose lies to my husband. Fact is that while I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of, I'm brutally honest. Information is being shared with her that is 100% true, hurtful, embarrassing, and can affect quite a few people. 

So I have no love lost over ending my friendship with this circle. My husband has been put in a very uncomfortable position, and I feel horribly for that. He is quite upset with the four ""friends"" that spent hours harassing me during our Sunday. But I kind of doubt he just wants to call it done. My man has a huge heart, and huge capacity for forgiveness. 

Just seeking advice on how to overcome the emotional hangover of it all? I can't concentrate, so my usual strategies to distract my mind just aren't working. 

My anxiety is in overdrive and I am overwhelmed with how awful this must be for my husband. I know I'm not giving them another moment to drain my energy or peace. Just really nervous about helping my husband cope.

In the past 2-3 years, I've seen a lot of doctors, therapists, etc. I have been temporarily diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, social anxiety disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. But then within a few months, the diagnosis goes right back to depression and anxiety. They increased it to depression with psychotic features. But now my current therapist doesn't agree with that.

You know, that huge feeling, that oppresses your chest and makes you wanna explode, ripe your hearth out so you don't feel anything anymore ?
Well, that.

Just fought with my boyfriend, my ""group of friends"" in my classroom do not give a fuck about me and I think that's because they don't really like my bf ? In any ways, they are amazingly rude and it is just so hurting.

I felt so intensly overwhelmed. And when I'm overwhelming... I feel suicidal.

Fuck, it would have felt so good to actually be dying. Like, I don't know, taking a lot of meds, or just laying in the bathtub and cutting my wrists open, slowly passing out in the warm water, the music I like in the background.
That just sounds like such a relief.

I hate myself, and just my life lately.

And I hate myself even more because I don't really have any reason to be sad. I'm just a fucking unhappy brat.

So I have been having an horrible week but today was probably the worst... I live with my partner and with roommates... This morning my boyfriend got out of our room and talked to our roommate. Apparently, this week when I cooked for myself I forgot to clean part of a mess I made. I had an accident and spilled something. I cleaned up what I saw, but I didn't think to check inside the cupboard. My roommate got pissed about it and spoke to my boyfriend about this. Boyfriend gets back in the room and confront me about it. I explained I didn't knew it spilled inside and would gladly clean it. Since I have a phobia of being judged (social anxiety in a nutshell) and my roommate was still using the kitchen, I really did not wanted to show my face out of my room while she was still mad about it, so I said I would do it as soon as she leave the kitchen and my boyfriend accused me of being too prideful... In his mind if I did not wanted to clean up, it was because I did not wanted to ''bow'' to her and admit my fault... He even argued with me when I tried to explain that I was terrified... **''I'm sorry but no... its not anxiety, its just your pride, I know you, you're always like that''**

That statement broke me... The way I see it, every time something like that happened, he just assumed it was pride... Obviously I have pride, everyone has.... but mine is broken because of many past experiences and mental health issues, but I still admit my faults. In fact I even take too much of the blame in arguments just to make the argument settle down quicker so I can flee. So stepping on my pride.. its almost a daily thing to me... I have to deal with apocalyptic mindset, depression, and overwhelming fear of judgement and now I will worry like crazy about seeming too prideful... I really could use a break of this right now...

&amp;#x200B;

Before anyone judges my boyfriend, he may not be the most considerate person when it comes to my mental health, but he does bring a lot of positive in my life... its just... at times I really feel overwhelmed by everything and I cant turn to him as he doesn't want/try to understand... I haven't reached a breaking point yet... but this hurt me so bad... I'm scared that the next thing thrown at me will be too much... I had to spend an our alone in the bathroom today to regain control of my thoughts and stop trembling then another hour cleaning it just to feel less self-conscious about the mess I made in the kitchen.

,mentalhealth,"Just want to start off by saying that this post is in regards to a recent YouTube video of mine. If that bothers you, then by all means feel free to exit out of here.

The ancient Stoics understood that there's only one thing that we can control in life, and that's ourselves or in other words, our perspective.

We can't control how people act toward us. We can't control what happens to us. We can't control the traffic. We can't control the weather. All that we can control is how we see those things. And in the eyes of a Stoic, that means to accept them as they are. No need to fuss.

That's point number one.

Point number two is that we can enhance that perspective by being grateful for the good things in our lives. 

We all have something that we can be grateful for. By focusing on the goodness we put ourselves into a much more positive state, and thus improve our perspective.

So long story short the key to happiness, or at least the most important one, is perspective. How we see ourselves and our lives, greatly affects how we feel.

&lt;p&gt;I’d be a much happier person if everyone just left me alone. Like truly 100% alone.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Note: I got super duper off topic. 

I think that the title above is the best shortest summary of it but I will go on anyway.

It really doesn't take much, a few words and a few minutes. You don't have to say much or even compliment me. Just look at me and ask me what my name is. There doesn't need to be anything more. Any sign of genuine interest in me and who I am is all it takes for me to pay attention to you for months. I become aware of you and your existence and start thinking about it. For example I have a crush on a girl I didn't see for almost two years - I wasn't even friends with her.

It's odd because as soon as anyone notices or talks to me I want to run. I panic but try to remain calm and normal. 

I also know that this isn't real love. It's some kind of a desperate obsession because I truly love attention despite how much it terrifies me.

I do what I can to remain rational. But why am I like this in the first place? Is it my shitty relationship with my mum? My lack of a relationship with my dad? The fact that I don't think anyone I have ever been friends with has ever really liked me as a person? Does it have anything to do with the fact that my life took a complete 180 degrees turn in a flash and I became so alone? Not even realising that it was an issue. That anything was an issue, that everything wasn't ok?

Honestly at this point I think I'm just a mess. Not just because of this but because of other things. I can't talk to people, I don't know how. I panic and don't know what to say. Sometimes I just feel so depressed and while all of that sucks I think the impact of time is what plays the biggest part. I don't even know when this started, it has been years. I tried to get help but there is always something in the way, and when there isn't, it's always the fear that stops me. Do I even need to speak to a professional I ask myself? Am I wasting resources. I know it's not rational but I can't get a hold of myself whenever I try to make that phone call.

I don't think much about any of this, I try to avoid it. I forget about my anxiety untill I have to speak to another human being.  I forget about so many things. I even started having memory issues recently. I can't even point out all the things wrong with me because my mind is blank 99% of the time. Just someone sitting next to me on a bus makes it hard to breath. I don't know how I will get a job, how I will live on my own. 

However despite all this I love myself so much most of the time. I look in the mirror and I couldn't be happier to be me. Not because of my appearance but because I like who I am as a person despite the flaws I have. Yet at the same time maybe I am insecure on some level? I can't really tell but I probably am.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Maybe it's a rant or maybe I just want advice. TBH writing about myself and getting this out is just nice.

,mentalhealth,"I live alone and for the most part, I work on a very small team and spend the majority of my day alone. Because of that, I place a lot of value on my friends. The problem? I don’t really have any.

I do have friends via work and one I play video games with online so that helps but they all live far away (I don’t have a car and it’s an hour drive to get to any of them because they live in the opposite direction from work). 

The real problem is my college friends. I moved up to the city so that I could see them more; four of six of the guys I lived with, my best friends in the world, all live here. Then one moved to Kenya and didn’t invite me to his going away party. The others live not even a 15 minute drive away and I am always the one to reach out. Not once have they engaged first and it makes me feel really shitty and like a huge burden to them. One of them even works at the same company as me and I haven’t seen him since November.

I’m used to getting the runaround and I always hear “I’ve been so busy” which I’m not buying as an excuse anymore. I hold my tongue but I’m always thinking “really? You’re so busy you didn’t have time to send a five second text? You’re telling me that not once did you have a single moment to yourself to watch a movie or play video games when instead you could reach out? Which again takes five seconds”

For the past two months, I’ve been doing an experiment: I’ve resolved to not text my friends for at least three months to see if they even remember me. It’s already been two months and nothing. Which leads me to my question: what do I do about it? Do I just let them fade into the background and try to forget or move on? Or in the future, say at four months, should I confront them and ask point blank if we’re even friends anymore?

This has happened to me a lot and I’m struggling to understand why. I have so many friends, outside my college friends, that have ghosted new for inexplicable reasons. One didn’t respond to me for six months and I honestly thought he had died or moved. He ended up texting me a week before he went to Amsterdam for grad school and the only question I had for him was “what the hell man?” to which he didn’t have any answer. Another friend at my old job did the same thing; I was actively trying to get him a job at my new job because he’s pretty skilled and he just ignored me for four months and when he did get back in contact, he had no excuse. I understand if something really bad happens like a parent dying but that’s never the case; all I get is a shrug and a half baked apology. It happened again recently but thankfully not as bad with a girl I used to be into that I’ve been trying to hang out with and she ignored me for two weeks and couldn’t even extend the courtesy of telling me she was busy.

Why do people treat me this way? I’m not a pushover by any means, in fact I’m widely regarded as a “force of nature” and a somewhat intense individual. But I struggle to understand why people abandon me and just forget about me. Is it because I don’t have any social media like Facebook? Or am I just that shitty of a person that no one wants to be around me? 

It makes me really really sad. Thankfully I’ve never had issues with suicide and I never will, I’m very fortunate to be incredibly self-aware, but this stuff is wearing on me in a bad way and I’m slipping further into a depression. And I don’t have anyone I can talk to about it; I have a therapist but I haven’t seen her for a while and won’t for another while because of insurance issues and the 15 minutes with the Suicide and Crisis line in my city isn’t enough.

I don’t know what this is,  normally I would be happy about this because when I cry I feel relief but today I don’t. I don’t feel better, but it feels like my soul is speaking to me sounds weird but Idk can anyone relate to this?&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth," 

I have periods of clarity where I grow a lot in a day or two and then a massive downward spike into confusion and I lose myself completely. I've accepted this pattern but I've found out I can accept and embrace it as much as I want, it is actually a problem. I tell myself its my unique little thing I have to deal with, everyone has them and that's okay. I also can completely disconnect with the world, control my thoughts so much that I only think certain things and the world becomes a magical harmless place. But this isn't life and those methods come at a rather large cost.

I'm the crazy guy at this point and honestly I don't really care, its the only way I feel okay and stop myself from hurting others, or as least thinking I am. I have been to so many strange places in my mind and I've trimmed off the physical world to only what I thought was absolutely essential. I will ignore people, ignore social constructs, ignore pain, ignore literally anything I need to in order to have stability for an extended period of time. It killed me at first to do this because I would be hurting others, but I figured they'd get used to me like this and I'd just be known as that guy, plus I was harmless enough right? I have no choice to ignore my mixed feelings and doubts because my quality of life was my excuse.

I've tried millions of things to fix this ""problem"". Including not seeing it as a problem but something to learn from and adapt to but unfortunately to no avail. I've of course done the typical google search but few people have posted what seems similar. I read piece on disassociate disorder which seemed eerily similar but I'm extremely hesitant to suggest I have anything wrong with me at all without the opinion of others.

I've done some research on the spectrum and I feel that is a possibility, I have brought this up with a few friends and family but they are adamant that's not the case. Although they are not professionals of course. My councillor who I saw twice was not much help because on 1/2 days I had clarity. On the day I was confused she agreed with my suggestion that the spectrum was a possibility but I was forwarded onto a doctor and as I felt clarity that day she sent me away with a referral to more sessions but essentially wrote me off as a silly teenager who will figure it out eventually and left me with a few half hearted responses about managing yourself through your actions; diet, meditation and exercise. She didn't buy any of it and instead changed the topic to getting an sti check. That kinda hurt because it took a lot for me to put myself in that position. It left me with little hope for the future and a forced outlook on being content. I turned 21 recently.

Apologies if this is unclear or confusing, I don't really know if this makes any sense. I'll inevitably read this tomorrow and be confused myself. I've tried not to answer my own thoughts and questions in this post but apologies if I've fallen into that habit again.

,mentalhealth,"Note: this post got really long, but the title explains most of it and I wanted to share my accomplisment. 

I struggle a lot with overthinking, mostly about social events. When I’m at school, or at work or just any place with a lot of well known people around I really quickly say yes to hangout plans or ask if I may come as well. I usually regret doing this right after, because I start telling myself they can have a far better time with other people/without you. Most of the time I keep it at that and just don’t mention anything about it anymore, hoping my friends will forget I said yes. However, if they remember, I try to be truthful and say something like: “I don’t think I add something,” or, “It’s better for you to spend your time without me or something.”

Anyway, to give some context. I was at school with friends and they made plans to do something, but I wasn’t really taking part in the conversation. They did invite me to hang out with them, which felt really nice because it had been a while since we as a group hanged out. Later that day, I was put into a group chat with all the people that would come, but I noticed I was added later then everyone else. This already made me start thinking they didn’t want to have me there, but one of them quickly remembered (and in my head probably regretted) to invite me as well. I really didn’t think I should go, but I said to myself, just go and have a good time. When I cycled to my friends house I constantly said to myself, “Why are you going, they don’t want you there. They just wanted to be nice. It was a gesture, not a real invitation.” etc. I then stepped off my bike and wanted to call my friend that I wasn’t coming. After standing in the freezing cold for 10 minutes, still overthinking if I should go and also overthinking if I should call or just don’t go without saying anything, because “they won’t even notice that you’re not there. And if they notice, they’ll just be glad you didn’t show up”, I finally got back to cycling and had a great night. 

It was an real eyeopener for me and my first step to overcome my overthinking. 

TLDR: Struggle a lot with overthinking. Got invited to hang out with friends.

,mentalhealth,"I’ve posted multiple times about how I have a hard time opening up to others and talking about my problems to my loved ones and not getting help from a professional.

Well, good news! I’m getting help! I recently got in touch with my school counselor and I couldn’t be more excited! Our first (and only so far) session didn’t really discuss a lot. He wanted to focus on getting to know me and understand my situation while also introducing himself and we basically were just getting to know each other so that I was more comfortable with talking to him. He was so nice that I nearly broke own because I forgot how nice it is to actually talk to someone about my problems. I don’t have to worry about burdening him because it’s his job to listen to my problems and it makes me feel a lot better about venting.

Even though we didn’t discuss much about my problems, I’m really excited to see him again. He gave me some advice about my ruminating thoughts and how the mind is like an iceberg. Your conscious is the tip of the iceberg and the your subconscious is everything below the water and sometimes the problem is below the water and harder to see and you just have to break down the iceberg to realize just how big the problem really is.

I haven’t told my parents that I’m seeing my counselor yet, and I don’t plan on telling them for awhile until something serious comes up (like having to get a proper diagnosis or whatever).

In other news, I’ve been pretty happy because a friend I haven’t seen for a while got in touch with me recently. He was driving home yesterday and he was feeling worried so he called me so that he could focus on something else. I really like him (a little more than as a friend) and so it meant a lot to me that he reached to me of all people. We talked about a lot of things, especially about our mental health and we talked about how our state of minds are very similar right now. We’re both stuck in this time loop, like we’re TOO stuck in the present. It’s a little hard to explain, but once you experience it you know exactly what I’m talking about. I just felt overwhelming emotions after he hung up and I just wanted to give him a hug and make sure he was okay because we are best friends and I don’t ever want to see him hurt and I want him to know how much I love him.

Other than that, I still feel like shit but I’ve come to accept it and that I’m going to be okay. I’m going to get better and I’m going to be happy someday. I’ve come to accept that being sad isn’t a bad thing and it’s something we all experience but we get over it eventually. Everything is temporary, even when it seems like it’ll never end.

,mentalhealth,"I don't even know where to start with this one but I need some advice.

Since leaving school at 16 I feel like my life (and my mental state) has been in steady decline. I'm now approaching 20 and I'm male by the way.

Without wanting to bore you with every detail of my life, my situation is basically this: Since leaving school, I've lost pretty much all my friends as we've all grown distant from eachother, I'm in a relationship that is not fulfilling and making me miserable, I'm working a shitty job with shitty hours and I can seem to connect with any of my workmates, my financial situation is pretty dire and as I can only get part time work it's not getting any better.

,mentalhealth,"Hi All

I'm a OCD/BDD sufferer who is, right now, doing okay. But obviously I still have obsessions and anxieties all the time regardless of how well I think I'm doing. 

The main thing I worry about all the time now is about getting married and having kids. I'm 33 and my girlfriend is 27 and in a couple years she wants to start a family.

I am petrified of getting married and having kids. It's something I've always theoretically wanted but as I've gotten older and gotten closer to the real deal I find myself recoiling from it and worrying about it constantly. 

There's many different reasons why I'm afraid of it, not least of which is that I straight up will not be able to physically tolerate the mental and physical demands of raising children, the sleep deprivation, the lack of alone time (I'm a serious introvert), etc. Also the fact that I'm the third of three generations of severe mental illness on my dad's side (my Korean war veteran grandfather drank himself to death at 60, his son ((my dad)) died at 57 after a lifetime of severe mental illness) and then there's me, and I would hate to bestow this pain on another child. 

Then there's the fact that most marriages end in divorce, and I don't really believe in the commitment of marriage, I believe in just taking it one day at a time and hoping for the best, which isn't really conducive to raising a kid for 18-20 years straight. 

Then there's also the fact that she wants 3 kids and I want 0-1 kids. 

I also worry about not having kids, and all the old folks who claim that I'll be lonely and regretful if I don't.

I also have the sense of running out of time and I already feel some level of shame being the age I am and not having kids already, and then worrying about what people will think of me if I have kids in my late thirties (even though many people in my family don't have kids yet and are older than me, or have had kids older than me).

,mentalhealth,"My partner and I have quite a turbulent relationship. She has borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety and ocd. We recently had quite a bit falling out after she locked me out and left me to sleep on the stairs of our apartment building. I reluctantly called my mum to come and get me as I couldn’t sleep on the stairs and she wasn’t going to be letting me back in any time soon (it’s happened plenty of times and I have slept in my car for days - but I didn’t have my keys this time). This was all over me having a bad stomach and needing to use the toilet which she had a panic attack about (I am not allowed to use the toilet to shit at home because she has a panic attack every single time). I have stupidly been feeding into this by using the toilet at the shop every time and holding it in for days on end which has pretty much fucked my bowel up. 

So I’m currently 35 miles away at my mums house and have been for 11 days now and we have grown quite distant. We have been talking pretty much every day and she has been struggling a lot. She tells me that she hasn’t eaten and isn’t washing herself properly. She’s basically gone into a deep depression and is now completely emotionally numb. She isn’t sure she loves me anymore or if she’s just depressed and can’t feel it. I’m trying to support her as best I can from my mums. Both of my legs are currently in plaster so I can’t drive, otherwise I would be driving to see her several times a week. I asked her if she wanted to come and see me on Saturday and she agreed. While we were together she was just extremely uncomfortable and nervous, she said it was like I was a stranger and we were on a first date. She then became angry and said that she had been dependent on substances and benzos this whole time. I told her that that is probably why she’s so numb at the moment because she has been taking so many benzos each day. She got frustrated and said that’s the way life is because i CHOSE to leave her. I got upset and said that I did not choose to leave, I had no choice. I’ve been asking to come home but she doesn’t want me home if she has to care for me in any way (my casts, emotionally, dodgy stomach etc). Therefore we are holding out until I have myself sorted before I move back in.

Each day for the past few days, she is keeping me up all night by telling me that she is suicidal at around 10-11pm. She will then turn her phone off and will not communicate with me until the morning. I can’t contact her parents as they have asked me not to involve them in this. They are tired of her behaviour and they don’t know how to manage her. She has behaved like this before when we did not live together and would send me messages that would worry me and then would turn her phone off. I would call the police and she would answer the door in her pyjamas and she had been sleeping the whole time. So it looks like I’m wasting police time and I’m just a complete idiot. If I call the police while I’m at my mums they will most likely section her as she is currently under the mental health team and has been for the last 4 years. They have told her that with her current presentation, any concerns for welfare and they will look at assessing her for hospital admission. I don’t want that, we both know that if she goes into hospital she will most likely kill herself. I have worked in mental health for and I don’t trust them to keep her safe. 

She has told me that she resents me for being able to just carry on while we go through this. I feel like she is making sure that I am not comfortable at my mums. When she came to see me, she didn’t bring any of my belongings when she knew that I have nothing here not even a book or something to keep me occupied. I had to go out and buy new clothes. She is angry with me for choosing to leave but will then go back on that and tell me she knows that I didn’t have a choice and she’s sorry for locking me out. She tells me that it’s going to change and she’s going to manage her anger with me and will just let me live my life (I can’t go to visit my parents most of the time, even going to a family funeral was difficult as she didn’t want me to leave her and I turned up 15 minutes late). She is completely dependent on me and I’m trying to get her to be more independent before we try again with our relationship. I think she senses this and has just increased the pressure. After I saw her on Saturday she told me that she had jumped off a bridge when she got home but she was okay. She walked to her car and drove home. I don’t know how believable that is, I don’t know if she said that to get a reaction from me or if she actually has jumped. She then turned her phone off all night and my mum had to sit up with me until 4am because I was freaking out. I eventually called her bluff and went to sleep and she woke up in the morning and was absolutely fine. Last night she told me that she was going to wake up at 2am and kill herself because she can’t make it through the night. I offered to come and stay with her but she said it would make it worse because of the relationship problems we are having and she would just have to ‘hope’ that she can make it through. I honestly just feel so trapped and im in turmoil every day and it’s really taking its toll on me. My mum is getting frustrated that I am letting her manipulate me but I don’t know how much of it is manipulation and I don’t want to call her bluff and something happen to her. She would be so angry with me for contacting the police or the crisis team. Last night she told me she just wanted her old life back (in and out of hospitals and psychiatric intensive care). She doesn’t want to live a ‘normal’ life of working and family etc. She likes the chaos and the drama, that’s how she has grown up. I’m just tying her down and trying to give her a better life, which probably isn’t what she wants anymore.

She has borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety and ocd. We recently had quite a bit falling out after she locked me out and left me to sleep on the stairs of our apartment building. I reluctantly called my mum to come and get me as I couldn’t sleep on the stairs and she wasn’t going to be letting me back in any time soon (it’s happened plenty of times and I have slept in my car for days - but I didn’t have my keys this time). This was all over me having a bad stomach and needing to use the toilet which she had a panic attack about (I am not allowed to use the toilet to shit at home because she has a panic attack every single time). I have stupidly been feeding into this by using the toilet at the shop every time and holding it in for days on end which has pretty much fucked my bowel up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m currently 35 miles away at my mums house and have been for 11 days now and we have grown quite distant. We have been talking pretty much every day and she has been struggling a lot. She tells me that she hasn’t eaten and isn’t washing herself properly. She’s basically gone into a deep depression and is now completely emotionally numb.

I got too into my friends's problems I developed clinical depression

I talked a friend out of suicide, she then turned manipulative, and threatened with killing herself several times, saying that if she actually died by her hand, it would be my fault. It's been years since that happened, and now I'm waiting for all contact with her to disappear.

Those are the most toxic issues I've had with being there for my friends. The other have problems, too. But there are problems that I can give advice with, and they talk about other things other than their problems.

I'm happy to listen and be there for them, but I'm not equipped to deal with their troubles. This ""therapist friend"" thing is harming my progress with depression a lot. They are not there for me when I need someone, yet I am always there for *them*.

,mentalhealth,"Hi, so i'm 22 F living in the uk but I was born in a small town in north Brazil and i am hoping to visit there again this summer coming up...but im terrified. 

Last time I went I was 18 - BY MYSELF (I wouldnt dare doing it now) and i had a great time with my family and didnt have these worries that I have now. Minding that when I was there we got burgled whilst we were sleeping but it didnt seem to affect me then and idk if it does now? 

Lately ive been more and more anxious in every day life but i feel like its because an obstruction now because i really want to see my family in brazil. Im scared of the long journey flight there, scared of the mosquitoes, the snakes (heard a family friend nearly got bitten), the spiders and im scared of getting robbed (as ive forgotten the language a bit and me and my bf stand out like a sore thumb). 

All of these thoughts have arised and i never used to take much heed but now i've got older and ive had 2 immediate family members pass away - im just always on edge about my safety - heck ive even turned into a hyperchondriac! 
Its as if every few months i add another layer of bubblewrap to keep me safe. 

Questions:
1. how can i start stepping towards being less anxious about everything? 
2. Is there any underlying issues that is causing me to be more anxious? 
3. How do I calm myself if i were to feel anxious if i go to Brazil?

I'm also very hesistant to go to the NHS about it because I went before and I didnt feel comfortable opening up to the people i was given and just have sortve given up on that option. But is it worth a try? I'm scared to think ill be judged by my gp or my work might find out and treat me differently or i might not have time to go for visits.

I would love some help placing these symptoms, I've been trying to find information online but I can drive myself crazy with that stuff, and thought it would be best to reach out to you wonderful people and see if anyone has any opinions on what this could be and if I should worry.

So I have anxiety, ADHD, and depression. Zoning out is something that I have delt with in the past. However more recently I've had these episodes which I have called dissociative episodes. I feel like my consciousness is being sucked into the back of my head, and often times I find the edges of my vision starting to turn black and I end up closing my eyes and my eyelids flutter, and then the feeling subsides and I start to sort of ""come forward"" again and I am left with a tingling sensation in the back of my head. I have three distinct memories of this happening, once at a grocery store last year where I still walked around and kind of was on autopilot and then came back to and I was a few aisles over and had filled my cart with stuff I needed to get. The second was when I was seeing a musical, and I remembered part of what was happening and started to lose the plot a little bit, and found myself still watching the show and listening to the music but feeling like my consciousness was being pushed back until I did the weird fluttery thing and came right back. I have flashes of the scenes and songs, but I really lost the plot (granted it seemed like most of the people around me did too.) I was probably in that pushed back mental state for like 15 minutes or so. And the final example was like, 20 minutes ago? I kind of felt like I was being pushed back for like a few minutes (I didn't check how long but I know it wasn't long at all) and am just left with a fun tingly feeling in the back of my head.

More context time: I have done a lot of research on DID and I don't think it's that because I don't feel like I have really lost long periods of time or have any other distinct personalities (it's more like personality states, but I feel like everyone feels more macho in some situations and more delicate other times) but yeah, no amnesia and no trauma as a child. As far as if it's DP/DR or BPD that's for sure possible cuz I have a terrible sense of self and sometimes feel like I don't belong in my body. And it also could just be a bad brain dissociation thing. But I'm not a professional, and with my ADHD shit honestly I haven't had the time to really get into this with a professional. So I would love to hear what other people who know about mental health think. I'm still feeling not all here, but I also think it could be cuz I'm tired?

I was interrogated by a doctor and they told my parents everything. This only ended up making me get In trouble. The doctor asked my parents to take me back there and consider counselling, but like they would let that happen. They were mad and refused to believe that anything was wrong. I experienced trauma early on as a kid and a lot of my issues stem from that I'm sure. As a teenager nearing adulthood (grad) I've tried many times to find counselling, talking to my family, talking to friends, (mind you I don't talk much) and everything has absolutely done nothing. My school counselor told my parents everything like the doctor did, and that basically broke my trust. When I was suicidal I tried to seek out a councilor at a local youth space and they told me to wait 5 months for a 30 minute session. Is that reasonable? Sometimes I feel really stuck and hopeless. I have never gotten I diagnosis so it's really hard to explain anything I feel to people without them assuming I'm just an angsty teen. P.S, I don't have a family doctor either. I really really need to talk to someone who can help me.    What other options do I have?? Should I just stick it out until I can go to a professional clinic or seek therapy on my own?

,mentalhealth,"I've been a lot through my life, a lotta trauma mainly revolving around my shitshow family. My mom is psychotic, like legit psychotic. Sees stuff, hears stuff, delusional. Not in my life anymore, none of my family are- which is just.. Idk. I always check the news, look up their names on google- seeing if one of them died or killed another. Sounds crazy but TRUST ME it is NOT irrational to believe. They are really  that screwed up.

&amp;#x200B;

 With that being said, I know plenty of red flags, emotional patterns and general toxic traits/behaviors. I am a skittish person, will flinch if you make any sudden movements. Will raise my voice unintentionally, if you have a lot of energy. Though, I also have anger issues of my own. Unlike my mom or sister or really anyone I know with mental issues,  I don't get angry at others and blame them when I get angry. I don't start arguments, I don't call people names just because I'm miserable- I don't do anything other than hide, lay around depressed, or vent online. I am a closeted person, I don't like speaking out about my emotions and I'm damn good at hiding how I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

 No, when I say ""anger issues"", I  mean that in a defensive way. I may not lash out due to my anger, but I will with others. My emotional state is... Weird I guess. I don't feel human because of it, I have a lot of identity issues regarding how I view others and myself. I'm mostly content, emotionless but not monotone. Not happy, not unhappy. Calm and relaxed. But.. It can and will change, and there are no in-between when it does. I will not transition into one mood to the next, I literally go from one mood to the other. No warning signs. No nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

That isn't too bad and hardly noticeable. The only times it is is if I get suicidal or heavily depressed, or like I've mentioned- angry. Apply that to an argument and take into account the trauma and what I deal with- it is messy. I have a habit of physically lashing out on others because of things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not all arguments cause that. I can handle people being upset and restless, I can handle them yelling. I'll just get upset myself or be irritated and level-minded. It is when someone behaves in a way that reminds me of my family that set me off. I live with a roommate who possibly has bipolar disorder and he goes off on me over tiny things and has his hyper fixations on things that don't matter. This doesn't bother me, I mean.. It does but not to the point I lash out. He can call me names like he does, get all fussy, and I'll be somewhat calm during it all because I KNOW he's just being irrational. Yet, if his voice is monotone (emotionless) and he is in one of those moods- that is when I start freaking the fuck around and getting violent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only because those moments he gets like that are meaningless and absurd, but also because  my mom used to get like that too. I don't exactly know how to describe what I'm talking about- you know how insane people don't know right from wrong or is not in the bright mind? Like, they are not aware of the world around them and shit? Yeah??? sort like that I guess????? That mood where they blow a tiny thing out of proportion and says things that make no sense but they are angry about- but their anger doesn't show itself in their voice because their voice is very matter=of-fact and emotionless and they are IMPOSSIBLE to reason with due to their unawareness and unstable mood. Ya feel? Probably not, but that's the best way to put it.

&amp;#x200B;

That is probably what gets me the most- that and other things that remind me of how my mom would act when unstable. There is no moment where I realize this, it all happens so fast and I almost have no control. A blink of an eye. I'd either through what's in my hands or hit you in desperation. Again, this is due what THEY are doing/saying. One time I threw a fork at my roommate because he was insulting me in one of his fits and I was calm yet irritated until he made an insensitive comment regarding my mom. That is when I started screaming at him and just broke down there and then, first throwing the fork at him. I also have a habit of running off, like I left the house soon after with plans of never returning. It's really impulsive behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

I fear I might one day kill someone because of my unpredictable behavior and actions. This week alone I slit my wrists, hurt my knuckles from punching the wall, and had plans of running away. Not because of arguments either. I havent been in one recently, this is all due to being suicidal and depressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

What if I end up stabbing someone or killing someone? I get homicidal thoughts but never act on them ofcourse. What if something happens and I snap? I feel guilt, but a lot of times I won't feel it. A lot of times my empathy and guilt turn off for some reason, and I do things I really shouldn't. Idk... Sorry if this is kinda all over the place and repetitive, just venting really...

,mentalhealth,"I've started seeing a psychologist for the first time in five years since I tried committing suicide. These past two years I've noticed a huge change in my mood, especially the past six months but it's always came in waves within the past 10 years. I've had health issues where I've had heart palpitations, vommitting, my reproductive system has been really unstable and I've had weird out of body experinces and feel like I'm going to freak out in the middle of a crowd (I forget who I am or where I am).

 I go through phases where I've been getting so aggitated over the smallest things, take everything personally or get defensive, have a attitude or short temper with strangers, co-workers or friends.

,mentalhealth,"I had a realization today and it really hit me hard...

This may sound narcissistic a little and I feel a bit bad for thinking this... but I’ve always felt like I was the most generous person I know. Because I always put the feelings of others before my own and I feel like I do a lot of sacrifices for others, sometimes really hard sacrifices. Not that I feel entitled to my friends generosity... but at times I feel like I give a lot more than I get back. But today I realized... that a lot of the ‘’sacrifices’’ I make includes me erasing myself, making myself as small as possible, suppressing my feelings so that others are happy... Because deep down, I feel like a nuisance to others... so making myself small and not complaining is a way to make their life better... at my mental health expense...

The sacrifices I thought I made, were things like : not saying how I truly felt, not saying my opinion if it goes against someone’s opinion, not complaining when someone hurts me, not setting boundaries, letting people step all over me without complaining... and very often I’m really hurt but I say nothing... I smile and tough it out... part of this is cause by self hatred, but most of it comes from my severe social anxiety... I live with roommates, and I hide in my room a lot because I fear their judgement for minor things. I don’t like doing chores in their presence, because my mind is telling me they are judging me for not doing enough, I don’t feel comfortable outside of my room, because I get tense when in their presence. They aren’t mean, but I saw them blow up once, and I am terrified of people raising their voices at me due to past experiences. I litteraly freeze and all I can think about is « how to get out of here/what do I say to calm things down so I can flee »...

A recent example of something I still feel a bit angry about: This Christmas, my boyfriend of three years received 2 luxurious tickets to see hockey. My bf could not decide whether he wanted to go with me or his friends. It was a once in a lifetime experience, because we would never pay to get tickets like those. He obviously wanted to go with me, but I could tell he only wanted to go with me because of boyfriend-girlfriend obligations, and that he’d rather go with his friend... He could not take the decision on his own and kept asking me even when I straight up told him that I am not the one who should be deciding since it’s HIS gift. But he kept turning things around so I’d be the one choosing... The match was yesterday, and of course he went with his friend. Because I told him so... Truth is... I really wanted to go. I never had the chance to see a live match... but I told him to go with his friend because I knew that was what would make him happier... The person who gave him the tickets was actually surprised I wasn’t with him since he did have him the tickets in front of me, he just never specified if it was a gift for the both of us or just to my bf... but, aside from the people who will read this post, no one will ever know how I truly over this...

,mentalhealth,"As in, how much do you let them know what's going on with you? 

My mom is sort of nosy and can be overprotective at times. She always needs to know everything &amp; gets upset if I hide things from her, or if she finds out something from someone else before I get a chance to tell her myself. She's always like ""I'm your mother, you have to talk to me"" so it makes me feel a little guilty but it also feels very controlling. 

It doesn't help that I still live with them (please keep the ""you gotta move out"" comments to yourself, thanks). They probably feel entitled to know every step that I make. They still have authority over me, in a way. But think about it, even as a teenager, how much did you share with them? I feel like I've never had healthy boundaries when it came to sharing.

,mentalhealth,"My family has always had terrible mental illness and I guess it’s finally hit me this year. I just feel heavy like I’m too light and my thoughts get to me almost every morning I wake up and it’s hard to do something as simple as getting dress and my anxiety has gotten to the point were I can’t ask question or buy my own things. 
I even got to the point of bringing my own lunch so I don’t even have the chance of interacting with lunch ladies anymore.
I’m just tired and I didn’t realized how much I cope just by not going to school til I missed the whole month of December and instead of think “oh maybe there is something going on, we should take this seriously” they just sent a letter that said if I missed every one more day of school they will call the state or something

I just want it to stop, I couldn’t even go up to someone and ask for the money they owned me and my basically one friend had to ask them for it for me
I’m can’t even ask I just it’s getting to me and I don’t think I can go much farther
I’m not suicidal, I can’t mess up and let my family deal with more of my fucked up mess

I just want to ruin myself to hurt myself but I can’t even fucking do the “normal” thing and cut myself too much of a wimp with sharp pain 
I guess I lived up to being a fuck up

I get moment where I just am gone as I call it I was physically there but not mentally Could barley lift my arms and even talk 
This is a little thing we’re I just got don’t with being gone after fucking up and got yelled at and lost something cause I was a idiot and basically caused my parents to waste $50 
Names changed

Day after Christmas 
Bad anxiety and shit be fucking me up
So Sister and me had plans to go out and get sushi at noon but then noon passed and I didn’t want to bother her by asking and shit if she called it off and then the WiFi fucked up so couldn’t text anyone
Also almost had anxiety attack  and trouble breathing over nothing 
Apparently we were gonna go at 4 so got ready at 3 learned it was with mother  and sister after she came home from work also learned that I was supposed to have a 50 gift card but didn’t see it in all the tissue and threw it away and anxiety pops up again 
Looked through the trash that was obviously Christmas shit but didn’t fine it freaked out 

then was like I’m not here I’m not real so their is nothing to worry about and dislocated and was heavy and didn’t want to move or do anything cause I’m not there it’s just a body it’s hallow I’m not in it I’m only in it temporary it not mine I’m not it 

Then went to pick Abriel up and shit and they notice and I came clean after forcing myself to talk and shit. 

I was physically there but not mentally Could barley lift my arms and shit and then I was shaky and sister notice me hit my hands and shit and hold my hand but that made me tense cause no outlet and then had to shaky hand

 but mother  told to stop sister  said it was fine and we had a long wait so startbuck which was nice kinda came back to myself but not really until food mama started talking about me getting help and shit and sister  said it be probably drugs to help after mother  said she didn’t want to take that route but with how fucked up I am with anxiety and suffocating daily it seems that’s the only way

Got sushi was nice til came back all the way 
Mama bad that she didn’t get any pictures with all of us and threw a fit and I just wanted to be gone again and Sister couldn’t stay so she got even more upset about hardly seeing her and shit

,mentalhealth,"Hi, Im new to making posts, so please bare with me. 
I’m Em, I suffer with trauma induced anxiety and depression. Earlier today I had a panic attack and it was quite bad. I haven’t had one like that in a while. I was in my room when it happened (I live in the loft) and my dog was downstairs in the living room. Apparently he was whining and the door and doing little barks, so my sister knew something was wrong. She opened the door so he could come upstairs and he starts going frantic at my ladders, alerting my sister what was going on. He’s not a loud dog, he rarely ever barks, but he is going absolutely ballistic at this point, I’ve never heard him like that. He tries jumping up my ladders to get to me but can’t because my sister is sat on them, which seems to worry him even more. He then proceeded to get a flannel from the bathroom and bring it downstairs so my mum notices, he’s a very naughty dog so she noticed straight away. Normally he’s a bugger for dropping stuff, but he did as he was told, at that point my mum knew something was going on. She closed him in the living room and came upstairs. A little while later as I’m calming down I ask if he can come up, I wanted to see what he would do. Bronn is a very very energetic dog, he’s a young border collie, so he leaps on my mums bed as usual but he seems frantic. He climbed all over me, circled me, and finally laid down with his head smushed against my leg. 
The point of this post is really to see if anyone knows how he knew? I find it really strange, we were in completely different parts of the house. It really meant a lot to me what he did, I’ve never known him like that (he’s a complete tosser) and it’s something I’ll never forget.

,mentalhealth,"Hello! I guess I just had a question. But here's some backstory. 

I literally do not feel real. I feel as if I'm like, in a big machine looking though my eyes or something and I'm watching things happen to me in life. But I don't FEEL it.
I remember a few years ago I could feel the situations or the places I was in... if that's how you say that. Like i felt like i was there. But i dont now.

I'm almost sure that 2 experiences I've had in the past year have given me this problem. One of them is when I almost drowned in Yosemite while white water rafting a class 5 river. It was a very very traumatic experience as I got caught under the raft after it flipped over for a bit. This happened in June 2019.
The other experience was when I accidentally smoked laced weed at a friends house and had a really bad trip. I specifically remember worrying that what I was living and my entire life wasn't real while under the influence. Because I didn't know what was happening to me I was very scared which made the trip even worse. This happened in September 2019.

I guess what I'm asking is, does anyone else have this problem? And is there a way I can feel normal again? I really really just want things to feel like they used to but I don't know how. It's very frustrating and depressing.

,mentalhealth,"I was diagnosed with GAD last year, I know I've always had an anxiety problem, but since starting this new job my anxiety has been the worst, but I also don't want to make out that my work only seems bad from my anxiety. 

I've been going through the NHS SilverCloud CBT course, and despite me getting better with social life, house work, general things, my current job is something I really can't get over. I've been having many sleepless nights because my anxiety is so bad, I've also been becoming very depressed at this job. To explain what my job is like, I work in a call center for a recycling company, and it's the most stressful job I've ever had. Firstly the role was made more attractive to me before I started, they said in the interview it's not a sales role and won't be like working in a call center, then I start and it is indeed a sales role and the only difference it has from other call centers is that you're not timed when going the loo, however I find I can never go in the first place.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been going through the NHS SilverCloud CBT course, and despite me getting better with social life, house work, general things, my current job is something I really can&amp;#39;t get over.

To explain what my job is like, I work in a call center for a recycling company, and it&amp;#39;s the most stressful job I&amp;#39;ve ever had. Firstly the role was made more attractive to me before I started, they said in the interview it&amp;#39;s not a sales role and won&amp;#39;t be like working in a call center, then I start and it is indeed a sales role and the only difference it has from other call centers is that you&amp;#39;re not timed when going the loo, however I find I can never go in the first place.

,mentalhealth,"Please don't judge me. I just need to vent in a safe place. 

Today I broke down because my brain can't regulate the chemicals that establish emotions. I broke because my insurance is complete shit...

Thursday I went, with a new written prescription, to my pharmacy to get the Zoloft I've taken for three years. I had three ninety day refills from a different doctor. I was on my last two weeks and asked my new doctor for a script. Got the script, but waited (because I knew my insurance wouldn't fill it until I was closer to being out) until I had two pills left. The pharmacy closes early because the one pharmacist on duty had somewhere to go. No call from them. Friday there was a terrible ice storm and I couldn't leave my house. So yesterday (Saturday) I call to see if I can pick it up. They're busy and say I should have gotten a text. I didn't, can they just check quickly? Nope they'll call back. Never got a call, I didn't call them because I got extremely busy. 

Then today I go up there to see what the heck is going on. They didn't fill it. Why? My insurance isn't going to pay for the fill until the 25th. Why? It's too early for a refill. Wtf?? I can't call my insurance. They're closed on the weekends. They don't have a 24hour line. Why? Because they are the worst. I've had so many problems with them. 

I ask the pharmacist why I didn't get a call. They say I should have gotten a text from the automated system. I don't like that answer. I start to feel upset. I ask the pharmacist if there's anything they can do. I need the script. It's literally the only thing that keeps me feeling okay. It's not my fault. It's my brain. My brain can't regulate itself correctly. I feel like a druggie. I tell her, ""please I can't wait that long I need it ..."" She tells me I'll have to pay for it, ""I don't care"" she asks me if I'm sure and repeats that my insurance probably won't refund me. I'm tearing up and ask how long it'll take to refill. They close for lunch in ten minutes and it probably won't be ready for two hours. I start crying. Like fucking ugly crying. 

I begin to feel that familiar fight or flight shakiness. I pull out of the drive through and to the side. I start to cry. I can't stop. I call my husband. He can't do anything. I ask him to try to get someone on the phone. He gets off. He tries. He texts me that all he's getting is an automatic system. I just can't believe how unlucky I feel. 

I drive home trying to control my tears. I scream. I get home and just weep to my husband. I apologize for crying. For not being able to handle my emotions without a pill. I cry trying to calm myself. I usually don't like to have someone try to help me. I don't like being touched or held when crying. I was sitting on the ground next to the bed my husband was sitting on. I tried to get up (I'm six months pregnant and it's so hard) but couldn't. My husband jumped up to help me onto the bed. He held me and rubbed my back.

,mentalhealth,"I don’t know how to explain what happened to me tonight but it didn’t feel great at all. I grew up with parents that didn’t believe in mental health disorders, and that you can control your mental health any time with your own mind.
So, I have never been to therapy and I really feel like I should go. The only time I’ve ever felt the way I’m about to describe was at certain points in a past relationship, my ex girlfriend used to break up with me frequently and it would cause me to panic, I would get a really tight feeling in my chest, and stop being able to talk or function if I thought it was going to happen. I would be overridden with anxiety, and not be able to calm down. I would sometimes dissociate and I feel like that’s what happened to me tonight, but I was feeling the anxiety/panic attack feeling at the same time. 

So, I have some mutual friends of some of my very closest friends that are really cool. They’re serious musicians and will likely be playing shows this year and they’ve both been in locally successful bands in the past. I myself am also a musician and have been for several years, I’m a song writer and I like almost every type of music. I really like the music they want to play, which is faster punk rock. We finally got around to playing together tonight and while trying to figure out what to play over what the drummer was playing, I had a huge mental breakdown/began dissociating and couldn’t create anything on the spot or play music with them, it was like my brain wouldn’t let me. I felt like I didn’t have access to my own thoughts. I choked. I feel so horrible, I feel like I wasted their time and I’m scared they’ll be judgmental of me and think that I’m a fraud/not have a good opinion of me going forward. We stopped, got beers next door from a record store that we were using to play in after hours, and tried going back in and playing again after and I just couldn’t do it.

,mentalhealth,"Hi, I'm a 19M college student. I've always had problems interacting with people in person, whether it is talking, body language, eye contact, or the like. Now I've never been a social person; even in my childhood, I was known for just wanting to have some time alone. This, in turn, has manifested into a life of reclusiveness, loneliness, depression, and extreme social anxiety. I've never had it in me to ask for help because I felt I would be cast aside by those around me, just as I was in my preteen and early teen years. But, today, I've decided it's time to break the silence.

I figured the best way to start my journey of self-improvement was to confront my social anxiety, which has been severely hindering, no, denying my ability to build any kind of relationship with anyone. And I feel that if I can start to build relationships, that gives me a good platform to mitigate other problems, i.e. depression.

So here's how things line up: 

a) I never have it in me to initiate a conversation.

b) When conversation does happen, I'm super awkward. Like, slurring speech, hands in pockets, no eye contact, weird responses that aren't exactly relevant to conversation. Note that none of this happens when I am alone or talking online.

c) When I get asked to hang out, things are fine for a while, until suddenly my brain keeps telling me ""get outta there."" Usually results in me leaving early.

d) Barely any friends outside of online circles.

So I'm looking for any suggestions to help with this. Sorry for the long post, and I thank you for reading to the end. Have a nice day",t2_9yvqtyw,False,,0,False,Extremely bad social anxiety.

,mentalhealth,"I'm looking for advice on how to be able to cope with sleeping alone. 

Currently I have a boyfriend and we sleep together at least five nights a week, sometimes with me going over purely to sleep at his place. 

For some background info, I had lived with boyfriends (lived with one from 2014-2016 and the other from 2016-2019) for nearly five years straight with only living alone for about two months out of that time. Those two months were spent with me casually dating someone and sleeping at their house a several nights a week. I'm not used to sleeping alone. My current relationship started immediately after my old one (I was still living with my ex too) and we have been sleeping together the five plus nights per week since we started dating. The longest we have consecutively slept apart has been three nights.  

The nights where I sleep alone in my own apartment are miserable. Whenever it's time to get in bed, I start crying and get filled with dread. I feel physically sick, my chest is heavy and I get intense nausea. I'm in tears most of the time until I fall asleep. It makes me miss my partner so strongly, I often go out of my way to be at his place so I don't have to sleep alone. I am also get nightmares more frequently when sleeping alone and wake up frequently. I don't feel well rested when I have to get up the next day. When I really can't fall asleep, sometimes I will get back out of bed and go watch tv until I calm down and then try again. This usually makes it to where I fall asleep faster and have less issue but I still cry. 

Interestingly, I don't experience this if I choose to take a mid afternoon nap, maybe because I am exhausted if I am doing that?

When I sleep with my partner I fall asleep faster, have fewer nightmares, I don't wake up in the night and I generally feel better rested in the morning. He doesn't even have to be sleeping at the time, sometimes he'll stay up working or playing games in the same room and I sleep just fine. 

I want to be okay with sleeping alone. I hate that I feel this way. My partner is alright with me coming over every night to sleep over, he says that he enjoys having me over to sleep. I don't want to because in a few months we are planning to date long distance for about four months so I need to be okay with sleeping alone to make that work. The reason for that is that we are both in college and he graduates one semester ahead of me, the plan is for us to move in together after I graduate. 

Due to my sleep issue it has led to some questionable decisions on my end. Above I referenced how I lived with two different boyfriends in the same year - the second one I only knew three weeks before asking him to move in. He sold a bunch of his things and subleased his apartment to come move in - he was sleeping over every night and we decided ""Fuck it, just move in with me?"". 

I haven't talked to my partner about this. I don't want to pressure him or make him feel guilty for not sleeping with me every night, especially when we try the long distance. I want to be okay with sleeping alone, especially since it's healthier to be able to cope. Plus, this happens whenever one of us are out of town and can't sleep together so it's an inevitable issue even if we live together. 

Maybe another reason playing into how upset I feel is that he hardly ever comes over to sleep at my place. I take it personally that he'd rather stay at his place and sleep without me than drive the 15 minutes to come stay with me. I go out of my way consistently to stay with him. I have a busier schedule than him. For convenience, sometimes I won't go to my home for several days straight but it's frustrating since I feel like I'm paying rent just to store my shit... but I think that's a whole other post. 

Also, if it helps I have diagnosed Bipolar Disorder, a specific phobia (unrelated to sleep) and CPTSD. I am currently taking Lamictal 150mg but am about to transition into taking Lamictal 100mg + 5mg Lexapro, just need to pick up my new prescription.

,mentalhealth,"My (33F) husband (38M) and I have been together for 12 years, living together for 8 years, married for a little over 6. He was diagnosed with bipolar in his early 20s and we open from the beginning about his mental health.

Everything was going well until about 2 years ago. Husband convinced himself that his medication wasn't doing anything and, without telling me or seeking medical advice, stopped taking his medication. I could tell within a short while that something was different (short tempered, very defensive, not sleeping) and, when I found out the reason why, encouraged him to resume taking medication and speak to a new psychiatrist about changing meds.

Husband started seeing the psychiatrist who believed that maybe there was a misdiagnosis all those years ago and kept husband off the lithium. To say things went to shit over the next 12 months is an understatement. Towards the end of it, we were constantly fighting: I couldn't say anything without it becoming an argument. Husband became emotionally abusive towards me, was yelling at his boss, swearing at his parents- everything was totally out of character. Because of his illness, he couldn't see how bad it was or how it was affecting those around him. I had a few suicidal thoughts and became depressed myself. Had I not been scared that he would harm himself or our dogs, I would have walked out.

It all came to a head when, 7 months ago, he had an appointment with a different psychiatrist for a second opinion. He showed up late, didn't like the questions being asked, and started yelling at the staff. The psychiatrist had him scheduled and the police came to the house later that night to have him involuntarily admitted to the local hospital. He was to stay there until he was deemed to be not a threat to himself or others.

Husband was resistant to the treatment at first but was swayed after 48 hours to have a blood test so they could prescribe meds. He was put back on lithium and, within days, we could see an improvement. He was in the public hospital for 2 weeks and then in a private hospital for 3. It sounds horrible, but I was relieved to not have him at home: I knew where he was, that he wasn't doing anything stupid, and felt like I could breathe again.

Just before being admitted to hospital, Husband resigned from his job. He has not worked since. He is applying for jobs, going for some interviews, but has not received a 'yes' yet. We have savings put aside, but had other plans for that money. I wouldn't mind so much about the not working, but he's not doing anything at home. He has no motivation to do anything and sleeps most of the day.

Though we're not arguing, we barely talk. We haven't had sex in 7 months and I feel like we're room mates who share a bed, not husband and wife. I've tried talking to him about everything, but my attempts seem to fall on deaf ears, or things improve temporarily but revert to the way they've been.

I am at a loss about what to do. How can I encourage him to do more without coming off like a nag? His parents have tried talking to him wothout success. He is also seeing a psychologist but she hasn't been able to get through to him either.

Because of his illness, he couldn&amp;#39;t see how bad it was or how it was affecting those around him. I had a few suicidal thoughts and became depressed myself. Had I not been scared that he would harm himself or our dogs, I would have walked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all came to a head when, 7 months ago, he had an appointment with a different psychiatrist for a second opinion. He showed up late, didn&amp;#39;t like the questions being asked, and started yelling at the staff. The psychiatrist had him scheduled and the police came to the house later that night to have him involuntarily admitted to the local hospital. He was to stay there until he was deemed to be not a threat to himself or others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Husband was resistant to the treatment at first but was swayed after 48 hours to have a blood test so they could prescribe meds. He was put back on lithium and, within days, we could see an improvement. He was in the public hospital for 2 weeks and then in a private hospital for 3. It sounds horrible, but I was relieved to not have him at home: I knew where he was, that he wasn&amp;#39;t doing anything stupid, and felt like I could breathe again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before being admitted to hospital, Husband resigned from his job. He has not worked since. He is applying for jobs, going for some interviews, but has not received a &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; yet. We have savings put aside, but had other plans for that money. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind so much about the not working, but he&amp;#39;s not doing anything at home. He has no motivation to do anything and sleeps most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we&amp;#39;re not arguing, we barely talk. We haven&amp;#39;t had sex in 7 months and I feel like we&amp;#39;re room mates who share a bed, not husband and wife. I&amp;#39;ve tried talking to him about everything, but my attempts seem to fall on deaf ears, or things improve temporarily but revert to the way they&amp;#39;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am at a loss about what to do. How can I encourage him to do more without coming off like a nag? His parents have tried talking to him wothout success. He is also seeing a psychologist but she hasn&amp;#39;t been able to get through to him either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my husband but every day I get more and more frustrated with his inaction. Reddit, what advice can you offer?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm constantly trying to be busy so I won't be thinking about my feelings too much and currently I'm living in a share house where basically I have no excuse of being lonely cs I can just go to the shared space and talk to someone. Everyone's here is great, sometimes they'll give me suggestions and advices when I asked them but idk why every month especially at the end I will still be down or having this feeling of being tired and can't get out of my bed.

But then again, I feel like I have to figure out everything by myself cs I'm already considered as an adult (F23). These days it's getting worse, the morning I woke up I couldn't get out of my bed and always feel tired all the time.

I&amp;#39;m not trying to self diagnose bc I know someone else has worse symptoms than I do but at some point every month I don&amp;#39;t know why I always feel like crap. I&amp;#39;m constantly trying to be busy so I won&amp;#39;t be thinking about my feelings too much and currently I&amp;#39;m living in a share house where basically I have no excuse of being lonely cs I can just go to the shared space and talk to someone. Everyone&amp;#39;s here is great, sometimes they&amp;#39;ll give me suggestions and advices when I asked them but idk why every month especially at the end I will still be down or having this feeling of being tired and can&amp;#39;t get out of my bed. At some point when I talked to my brother (we lost our father 8 years ago) I told him maybe I need someone to be my mentor, like a guide so I won&amp;#39;t be lost in my thoughts and trying to figure out everything by myself so I won&amp;#39;t feel like crap all the time. But then again, I feel like I have to figure out everything by myself cs I&amp;#39;m already considered as an adult (F23). These days it&amp;#39;s getting worse, the morning I woke up I couldn&amp;#39;t get out of my bed and always feel tired all the time.

,mentalhealth,"hi, this is my first time posting on this forum but i just really need to vent and this is going to come off as very jumbled and inarticulate but i think i just need to get it off my chest. 

ever since i can remember, i've had more emotions than i know what to do with. when i get frustrated, my brain goes from zero to one hundred in a split second. i feel like i'm never in control of my emotions, rather that they're in control of me. no matter how minuscule the frustration is (spilling something on my shirt, getting on the wrong elevator, etc.) it often feels like it's the end of the world even when it isn't. something very minor that feels major will happen and before i can even do anything, my brain tells me that i should kill myself. i feel like my brain is lying to me all of the time. 

the frustrations become more and more of a problem when i'm around my parents/family and i'm not quite sure why this is. one of my theories is that i control my frustrations so much during the day that when i get home and/or around my immediate family, i kind of release all of the frustrations. i'm not sure if that's what the case is but that's one of my guesses.

i am a 19 year old girl who has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, BED, and PTSD. i currently see no psychiatrist or therapist: i am looking to change this ASAP as I am in fear of my life. my main trauma comes from various forms of abuse from my sister and dad up until around age 12-13. my mom has since been my rock and i live with her and her boyfriend. she has done everything in her power to help me, though sometimes she scolds me for my issues, i think it is due to frustration out of not knowing how to help me. some other noteworthy events are the divorce, sexual harassment when younger, dating way older guys when younger (daddy issues)/getting groomed, cheated on, manipulated. i have also struggled with my weight up and down since i was younger, which takes a toll on my mental health too. i definitely have attachment issues, if i am attached to someone i will try to kill myself or threaten to hurt myself if i feel they are not in love with me/try to leave me. i also overthink/worry a lot and deal with paranoia. i have been on and off meds, in and out of therapy, and used to go to psych wards for suicide attempts when younger...

i am just so tired of the cycle and hurting those around me. another thing that is pushing me to want to make this change is that i am now becoming abusive to someone i love, my boyfriend of 8 months. at first he had his own issues and was not so great, however now ALL he wishes to do is love and support me. all i do when i am like this, which is really often, i tell him he is lying about loving me, that he wants to hurt me, and i lie and tell him i don't love him and i used him, while none of this is true. i know im a piece of shit for this. i feel so much shame and guilt. i don't want to hurt him, and it is so much mental turmoil for us both, which is all my fault. it is sick. i am a kind, loving, and very sensitive person. i don't get mean to anyone else except him, and i feel so terrible for it. i want to stop. i want to love myself and in turn stop doing this to him. the issue is, when i get into these mindsets or convince myself everyone is out to hurt or get me, it gets very hard to switch out until i destroy something.

i am seeking some sort of guidance or suggestion. i am very unhappy with my weight right now, so medication scares me due to possible weight gain, which would make me MUCH more depressed. i also have always felt zombie like/i fear my brain will become addicted. overall, medication really scares me and if it is possible, i'd wish for it to be a last resort. i was wondering if trying and sticking to therapy again would help with this. the thing is, if it has never helped since i was younger, why would it now? (in terms of my impulsiveness/attachment issues). do i need to stress my desire to learn coping skills? is there a different approach i need to take? i am so lost. i really just want to fix everything. the other day i told my boyfriend i wanted to change, to get better--i really, really do, yet today i felt so low and scared that everyone hated me, i told him i was leaving, that i did not love him, and that i was going to find another guy. i am really disgusted...i just want to make it up to myself and the people around me. i need ways to cope, as that seems to be my biggest issue because it all spirals when i convince myself that i am useless or unwanted, etc. thank you.",t2_5hfvnmqe,False,,0,False,seeking help/opinions.,[],r/mentalhealth,False,,,0,,False,t3_er6eyj,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1579515383.0,text,,,,text,self.mentalhealth,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i don&amp;#39;t want to make this too long. please ask questions if it will help with responses &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Bulimia nervosa is almost a sort of mix of anorexia nervosa and binge-eating disorder. However, it distinguishes itself from these and other eating disorders through regular periods of binging (eating an excessive amount of food in a short period of time) and purging (trying to avoid gaining weight from the food through various methods)

Eating disorders are often pushed aside when it comes to mental health, and it's a shame because many people go without knowing that they have a problem. Many people view bulimia as eating a lot and then purging by puking which, yes, is one of the more common and dangerous forms of bulimia, but is not the only one.

There are two types of bulimia. Purging type includes self-induced vomiting, but can also be an abuse of laxatives or other medications of this type.

Non-purging type, harder to spot, includes excessive exercise or fasting. Exercise and fasting in itself are not harmful, but it is when it's used for the exclusive purpose of not gaining weight after a binging episode. These methods can easily become self destructive if used for the wrong reasons.

Please! Watch out for yourself and others! Non-purging type bulimia is still dangerous despite not involving purges and is much harder to spot than purging type, so please watch for any signs that you or someone else might be suffering.

Note: Bulimia is also not just purging and non-purging.

,mentalhealth,"I apologise for the long post but in order for you to see why I feel like I need to leave I need to explain how I’ve found myself making one of the hardest choices of my life.  I also apologise for the grammar but it’s been a long emotional day and I really hope this is coherent. 

Today I have admitted something to myself that I’ve been in denial about for fourteen years. I am an addict. 

I’m a 27 year old man who grew up in a town just outside of London. My mother is addicted to prescription pills like Xanax and Valiums and also smokes about an eighth of weed a day and has done for as long as I remember. She’s mentally ill herself and loves me with all of her heart and just wants me to be happy. My father was a depressed alcoholic who spent the last ten years of his life slowly drinking himself to death after a car accident and died when I was 19. 

I grew up on an estate and have been friends with the same people for all of my life. They have always felt like my chosen family even before we started partying. We used to run around the estate causing havoc together, we got in fights with other people and each other, we laughed and we cried together. Went through trauma together. We saw all sorts of people come and go but there was always a core group of us that were as thick as thieves, so much so people to this day still talk about how envious they are about how close we still are after so long. 

We didn’t stay boys forever though and soon drink and drugs came on to the scene. At 14 a few of us had already left school and were in the park drinking and smoking weed like a lot of teenagers do but before long outside influences led us to other avenues of taking the edge off on a Friday and by 16 we were already taking ecstasy and getting into underground raves in London. By 18 we were in the pub every weekend with a pint in hand and a wrap of coke in the our pockets thinking we were living our best lives. 

When my dad died at 19 my childhood dog had died an hour before and I couldn’t understand why life had been so merciless in such a short space of time and so I began to question everything I thought I knew. Was this the point of it all? Do we just live this way and then die? What’s right and what’s wrong? I started reading books by people like Emma Goldman and Noam Chomsky and I came to realise that the world isn’t actually quite right and so began the wanting of something more but what that something was I had no idea which created an emptiness that my friends couldn’t understand. To them all I was feeling was just words. 

The older we got the more we went through. Nothing too special, few heart breaks here and there, good times and bad times just like everyone else but the drinking and drug taking had gotten heavier. I couldn’t see it at the time but I’d become so used to getting out of it to escape reality that I’d actually become addicted to it.  I realise now I didn’t want it but needed it. By 23 I began smoking joints like they were cigarettes, pub on Friday, Rave on Saturday and smoke weed while you’re on a come down all day Sunday kind of thing. I knew it wasn’t normal but we were having fun and weren’t hurting anybody and I dismissed my fears of addiction as just a come down making feel terrible. 
At 25 I’d overdosed on some bad ketamine after being a bit reckless after a recent love interest had ended things and I ended up needing to be resuscitated on site at a festival. I still remember hearing people speak but seeing only black, until I felt a sharp sting on my leg where I came back around like I’d just risen from the dead. I had a cup of tea and went back to my friends before double dropping two ecstasy tablets my friend sold me. 
As my close friends all grew stronger with their partners we saw each other maybe once a week where once it would be more or less everyday. I became distant and spent more time on my own. Getting lost in my own head searching for something I still couldn’t find, making me feel emptier inside but then in June last year I met, who I’m going to call for anonymity purposes, D. 
I’d been in relationships before but never like this. We fell in love hard and quick. She was the sister of a friend so we kind of felt safe with each other as it was like an unofficial insurance policy that kept us both honest. 
The summer was perfect and for the first time in a long time I was hardly doing any drugs at all. I was still smoking a fair bit of weed but I was very keen on kicking it if not for me then for D.  But then D got pregnant.  Our own fault. We weren’t careful. It took us a week to decide what to do and at one point we were going to keep it until eventually we decided we needed to be us a little more first.  We went to the clinic and got the pill, and then I held her for hours as she lay on my bathroom floor bleeding, being sick, shivering and sweating at the same time, helplessly just holding her. Afterwards we both agreed that we made the right choice and we were glad we did it together. 
But then things took a turn. D had to move for work and we saw each other less but we were still making it work. I had doubts but she would constantly reassure me and make me feel like there was nothing to worry about. Talking of weddings and how I’m her world in November and how she needs to be alone December, a week after I moved back in with my mother to get rid of any overheads so I could start a business, a move I definitely wouldn’t have done if I knew I was going to be broken up with due the easy availability of drugs in the house. I was complete crushed. I know relationships end all the time but I couldn’t understand why she reassured me when she was just going to leave. How was I supposed to trust anybody else when she was as convincing as she was? Something I’m sure many of you will have gone through. Naturally I was filled with grief as all of this love in me suddenly had no place to go. My world had never seemed smaller and I spent weeks in bed going out only to drink and sniff coke until 5 in the morning before coming home, taking some Xanax to fight the comedown while I smoked weed and went in and out of conciseness right through to Christmas and my birthday, where I began to hit my bottom and everything began to change. 

I was outside a bar on my birthday with a friend smoking a cigarette when he said that D was walking toward us. I didn’t believe him because I didn’t know she was in town but low and behold there she was.  She looked at me and turned away, walking and pretending that we hadn’t just locked eyes. I could barely breath. I needed a drink and another boot of coke but as I went back inside a bouncer stopped me and searched me, pulling out a joint id left on the inside pocket of my jacket that I’d forgotten about. We argued and he threatened to call the police over one joint and I laughed at him and told him to do it and as I did, British transport police pulled up at the traffic lights outside and the bouncer waved them over, where they proceeded to arrest me for the weed and the wrap of coke I’d forgotten to disclose on account of being a drunken mess. It was my birthday after all which the police were more than kind enough to arrange a stay 25 miles away from where I live only to leave me there for another part of the police to deal with. I broke down in my cell and I cried. Cried for D waking away. I cried for being in a cell on my birthday while I was still rushing off coke. The station nurse came to see me and declared me a severe concern or something of the like. I was later released where the custody sergeant apologised to me as I should have been dealt with on the road there and then and been dealt a caution. Thankfully he offered two officers overtime pay to drive me the 25 miles home as it was 5 in the morning and I didn’t have any money. I got into bed and stayed there right the way through new year and the first few days of January where my dog (the one to replace my childhood dog) had died of advanced liver cancer.

I gave up.  I couldn’t see which way I needed to go anymore so stayed in bed alone but for weed, tramadols and Valium’s. Until Friday where I decided to put up a facebooks status essentially seeking attention and making out like I was going to commit suicide but in reality what I was saying was that an old me has to die for a new me to be reborn but I didn’t correct people who were wrong because I enjoyed the attention. 

My mum would come in a few times a day each time with some more weed and pills because all she wanted to do was see her boy smile and this seemed to be the only way to get close. 
My friends pulled me out of bed yesterday afternoon where we drank and then sniffed coke until 6 in the morning before I walked home, slowly pondering everything that had gone over the last month and then when I got home and started looking back at the last year, then the last five before finally I started looking at my whole life before coming to the conclusion that I was, as Russel Brand puts it,  “a little bit fucked” 

I realised that I actually want to be sad because I want to get high and escape. When D left of course her absence hurt but that wasn’t the real problem. The real problem was I wanted her to save me. To save me from becoming what I was well on the way to becoming, my father. 

Every time I feel like maybe my life is going in the right direction I end up in a place I never even knew could feel this bad, so I turn to escape reality in an environment where drugs and drink are everywhere I turn. I can escape reality but not the means to get away from it. 
When I looked back at my life, I genuinely couldn’t remember the last time I was completely clean.  Alcohol, weed, cocaine, ecstasy, MDMA, DMT, shrooms, Xanax, valiums, tramadols, diazepams, two overdoses, countless blackouts, nights where I’ve lost everything and made mistakes that have sent shockwaves reverberating through out my life. 

I’ve never been suicidal. Not truly. I get very reckless and flirt with things that seem risky and generate a sort of romantic perspective of death because the closer I feel to it the more I feel something, anything to make me feel more alive. 
Over the last two decades or so I’ve been blessed with what some people go there whole lives without having but I have become desperately unhappy in my life right now and feel trapped. I’m terrified a great deal of the time. Terrified of being my dad or worse. It consumes me and starts to affect people around me. At home my mum wants be to be happy but she doesn’t know how to make it happen so she does what she can but it makes it worse. My friends are the same. They don’t understand that the life we live and our attitude towards drink and drugs isn’t normal and that it’s slowly destroying me. 

Which leads me to the point of this whole thing. I want to live a life sober, but I’m not strong enough to avoid the temptations that come hand in hand with the people I love most in this world. I have to either pick my mum and friends who’ve shaped me and been my family or I pick a new life that’s far away from any kind of life I’ve known before. 

So am I the asshole if I leave my friends and family in order to be clean and have a better chance of happiness in life? Or am I just being over the top and do I need to find a way to be clean and be around the people I love despite what comes with that? 


My brother supports me and tells me I need to get out of this place as soon as I can. My mother supports me even though she knows it means she might lose a son.  My friend says to I’m being over the top and I should try CBT something I’ve already tried. 

I’m going to the doctors first thing tomorrow but until then I guess I’m just after a strangers ear. Someone who doesn’t know me to tell me their perspective on it what I’m doing is brave or cowardly.

So its quite late well almost early just 5 minutes until tomorrow and I'm up crying and searching some pretty personal stuff up. But that's what this post is, sharing this information.   So I was searching some things about depression and anxiety, at the moment I'm crying because I have most of the symptoms but I dont think I have depression.

I’m not sure if this is the right place to talk about this, sorry if it isn’t. The last couple of months I’ve been dealing with a bunch of things that have really taken a toll at my energy. 
I consider myself a lucky person and my friends joke that I’m Domino from deadpool (silly but is a cute reference). Lately I haven’t been feeling as lucky, in the last three months of 2019 I got into a car accident in the highway (construction site badly signed and at night) and literally nothing happened to me, just a stiff neck, my car had considerable damage but the insurance covered everything, this is an example of what I mean to have bad things happen to me but getting the best outcome out of them. In that same period of time my uncle went missing and was found 3 days later (he was the lucky one in this one, he is totally fine) and just last night someone tried to rob my car, that I’ve just gotten back from the shop, luckily(ha) because of this there weren’t any valuables inside, they tried to take the battery but they couldn’t. 
Friends and relatives keep saying that everything is fine, at least nothing worse happened in each case, that I’m safe and I get the sentiment but I’m so done with this stuff happening to me, I still get angry and scared, I’m scared to drive, to go outside too late or alone, I’m even scared to be in my apartment now and I don’t know what to do or why this kind of stuff keep happening to me. Should just accept that I’m like cursed? Or can I do anything to stop this kind of things from happening?  
I think the worst part is that for example I’m sure I got the trauma from my accident but since I didn’t have any physical injuries I had to deal with everything in silence, like I didn’t get the chance to recover mentally along an injury? Like I have to recover myself from all this things in silence and to keep going because I have other obligations and I just wish I could stop time and have a moment to heal myself or to even cry them out of my system and if I say something people keep telling me that it wasn’t a big deal because I’m fine physically but this things just keep eating me alive and I’m scared and far away from home and my parents and maybe all this things aren’t really that big of a deal anyways and I’m just being silly?

,mentalhealth,"
So I've been talking to this guy for a month. He was ok but he did say he had a past with suicide and whatnot. I didn't really mind since I've had mentally ill people in my life before they were usually ok just talk about suicide. Suicide doesn't bother me. It's not my life not my concern. But like he said he had financial trouble had been homeless before and says stuff like that he doesn't like living. Ok so it got more intense after our second visit and I gave him 40 dollars last Sunday he told me a sad story on how he couldn't go to work. Then two days later he's having trouble with work and saying he can't pay rent. Well on Friday he's begging for 100 dollars to cover his rent. He goes on extreme after that. When we were hooking up I did notice that he does cut he has cuts on his thighs and wrists. He always said he struggles with mental health and eluded to having been depressed. So I can't tell if he's ill or just wants money?




Here's the whole dialogue of last night


Me: ""What are you up to?""


Him: ""Being sad and hungry ""

""Contemplating""


Me: ""Sorry about that you want anything at the store on Monday I could get you I'm going into town on Monday""


Him: ""Anything that doesn't require cooking utensils""


Me: ""Why?""


Him: ""Because I don't have any""


Me: ""What ones don't you have maybe I can get some. Yeah I'm pretty sure I can get you a cooking pan""


Him: ""Why bother? By next thursday afternoon I'll be homeless again. I haven't been able to find anything that will make me the money I need I  the time I need it""


Him again: ""It's taking all my self control to not take a warm bath with this razor right now, but I'm not ""supposed"" to do that and I know it makes me a piece of shit to even acknowledge that's what I want to do, but I  personally would have preferred M***** said anything like this before she commit suicide but she stayed silent like a ""good/kind"" person""


Me: ""Do you still need 100 dollars? I think I can get it if I get my laptop from UPS apparently it's waiting for me there. Just give me until Monday that's why I'm coming into town""


Me again: ""Oh you want to commit suicide? Over this? You know time will past and this will be behind you.""


Me again: ""You're not a piece of shit. You're a very good person. It would be terrible if you weren't here.""


Me: ""Hello are you there?""


Him:""You say ""over this"" as though it's nothing. Have you ever even experienced what ""this"" is like? Do you have any idea the arrogance and ignorance that comment contains? Do you have any idea what 27 years of having nothing in this world feels like? Of what being condemned to misery actually entails? Of being pressed to look up just to be met with a boot in your face every time? To come to know ""hope"" as a poisonous and toxic thing? So what if I do somehow manage to come up with next weeks rent. What about the one after that or after that. You want me to look forward to another 63 years on this earth without taking a moment to consider how exhausting that sounds to someone like me. How utterly unbearable that feels? 63 more years of having everything I dream of ripped to shreds. 63 more years of having all my efforts dismantled by a cold cruel world. 63 more years of torture. 63 more years of a desire less existence. You just like the vast majority of this world speak negativel!

 y on a topic you couldn't begin to comprehend. How could anyone who's soul hasn't been broken possibly understand what it's like to not even remember what a desire to be alive feels like. Just because people like you feel fear over dying, doesn't mean those of us who embrace the idea are wrong.""


Him:""Why would it be terrible? Because I won't be here to bring kindnesses to this sick place, what makes you think anything in this world deserves what I have to offer in the first place?""


Me:""I'm miserable right now lol. I don't think about today I think about tomorrow. My good days are in your position honestly and I enjoy that every time I'm in that position. Life can hurt but there's always a soft point. That's what you need to hold onto""


Me:""I really don't have an opinion on suicide as if it's wrong right that's a personal decision I'm a libertarian. I'm just saying that your life doesn't have to be hell it could be perfect it could be beautiful and it could all be worth it. When dying could be app for what? I mean there's a purpose to even pain.""


Me:""No because you have suffered so much for nothing you have meaning you have value. Much more than to just be thrown away like that""


Me again: ""That's at least why I don't kill myself I have value I have meaning I have a purpose and since I was 7 I knew I had to suck it up take a hell of lifestyle because the next twenty weren't going to be pretty. People hated me despised me. Still do. For no reason enough that it's hard to get a job network make friends etc... But it's all part of a plan for the future you just have to find your own tunnel and keep going and never look back. What helps you has to be you.""


He didn't respond for almost an hour and that's when I got on the phone with the suicide line then the police twice when I was about to give his information I said you there? And he replied



""Yea I'm still here. I'm tired of being conscious though so I think I'm going to go to bed.y body feels tired enough to do it. Goodnight ""

That's all the texts last night.


That's when I told the police the wrong number and all that. Should I just try to find someone else and block this guy or do I continue to play his game or teach him a lesson? That's why I'm tired of knowing what to do in this case. To get what I want to have peace to make him focus on something else idk?


Next day it just feels like he's playing me again.




Me: ""How's ur day""


Him:""I just woke up from a nap. You got a solution to my dilemma?""


Me:""Of what?""


Him: ""How to come up with all of my rent? Cause if not then still as shitty as I was last night and this morning ""



Then he doesn't seem to want to get help either.

Me:""Oh last night? I wanted to ask you something?""


Him:""What""
""??""
""Where did you go""

Me:""I was wondering do you ever find it better to talk to someone about like your stress to alleviate it? Does it make it better for you? I know for me it does.


Oh I just did my laundry. 

I don't know anything until Monday but I hope you don't have to stress over that too much. It's only one day away""

Him: ""I don't have the money for a therapist""

Me:""Like Medicaid covers that though.""

Him:""I'm a young healthy white Male, they don't help with stuff like that""

Him:""I don't have insurance given to me because of that. Like it's literally what they told me when I went to apply is those are the reasons I don't qualify""

Me:""They help with that all the time I've seen people in therapy ur age and gender all time. Anyone who applies with the lack of funds is qualified in the welfare office actually... And as a side note you told me you were Asian lol.""

Him:""I never told you I was Asian? You confuse me with other people often""

Him:""AMD last time I went to get government aid they practically laughed at me""

Me:""No you said you were 3/4 Irish and two Asian countries you said it on the phone. I've never talked to anyone on the phone you said your aunt told you that.""

Me:""Medicaid? It's just a small application they get you approved as long as you show your paystubs.""

Me:""I do it at pecos and flaminog it's behind Panda Express near planet fitness""

Me:""I could give you the address""

Him:""I told you I'm 3/4 irish and a bunch of other stuff, some Asian ethnicities are on that list but it's a long one and yea I'm telling you last time I went they didn't give a fuck about me""

Me:""Ok maybe it was someone that didn't know what they were talking about but I'm pretty sure they'd approve you and you'd be able to talk to someone. I mean from my experience it really does help to talk about stress with someone. I mean it could alleviate your pain.""

Him:""What the hell is talking going to do? How could that possibly change anything. Not to sound like a dick but really, how does that help me cover rent or get work I won't get fuckes out of as soon as they don't need me anymore. The only way to alleviate my stress is to end it""

Him:""What time are you coming out tomorrow?""

Him:""??""

Me:""Yeah well it can help with the stress of your financial straights basically. Give you the tools in how to deal with it""

Me:""Morning""

Him:""I don't see how when they don't offer things like that to people like me. If I had a kid sure they would help but I'm just me those things don't care about people like me""

Me:""I don't have kids either lol yeah they help everyone hun not just people with kids single guys told me at precision they worked less hours to keep their food stamps in fact lol. They accept everyone""

Him:""They don't accept everyone.""

Me:""Yeah they do all you have to do is fit their income requirements""


The. Silence haven't heard from him I don't know what to do to block him to call the cops or to pretend he's saying none of this go forward? I still want to hook up with him as I'm very attracted to him. But I can't figure out is he just playing me or is he really a crazy person? I actually do like him.

I didn&amp;#39;t really mind since I&amp;#39;ve had mentally ill people in my life before they were usually ok just talk about suicide. Suicide doesn&amp;#39;t bother me. It&amp;#39;s not my life not my concern. But like he said he had financial trouble had been homeless before and says stuff like that he doesn&amp;#39;t like living. Ok so it got more intense after our second visit and I gave him 40 dollars last Sunday he told me a sad story on how he couldn&amp;#39;t go to work. Then two days later he&amp;#39;s having trouble with work and saying he can&amp;#39;t pay rent. Well on Friday he&amp;#39;s begging for 100 dollars to cover his rent. He goes on extreme after that. When we were hooking up I did notice that he does cut he has cuts on his thighs and wrists. He always said he struggles with mental health and eluded to having been depressed. So I can&amp;#39;t tell if he&amp;#39;s ill or just wants money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the whole dialogue of last night&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;What are you up to?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him: &amp;quot;Being sad and hungry &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Contemplating&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Sorry about that you want anything at the store on Monday I could get you I&amp;#39;m going into town on Monday&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him: &amp;quot;Anything that doesn&amp;#39;t require cooking utensils&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him: &amp;quot;Because I don&amp;#39;t have any&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;What ones don&amp;#39;t you have maybe I can get some. Yeah I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I can get you a cooking pan&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him: &amp;quot;Why bother? By next thursday afternoon I&amp;#39;ll be homeless again. I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find anything that will make me the money I need I  the time I need it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him again: &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s taking all my self control to not take a warm bath with this razor right now, but I&amp;#39;m not &amp;quot;supposed&amp;quot; to do that and I know it makes me a piece of shit to even acknowledge that&amp;#39;s what I want to do, but I  personally would have preferred M***** said anything like this before she commit suicide but she stayed silent like a &amp;quot;good/kind&amp;quot; person&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Do you still need 100 dollars? I think I can get it if I get my laptop from UPS apparently it&amp;#39;s waiting for me there. Just give me until Monday that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m coming into town&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me again: &amp;quot;Oh you want to commit suicide? Over this? You know time will past and this will be behind you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me again: &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not a piece of shit. You&amp;#39;re a very good person. It would be terrible if you weren&amp;#39;t here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Hello are you there?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;You say &amp;quot;over this&amp;quot; as though it&amp;#39;s nothing. Have you ever even experienced what &amp;quot;this&amp;quot; is like? Do you have any idea the arrogance and ignorance that comment contains? Do you have any idea what 27 years of having nothing in this world feels like? Of what being condemned to misery actually entails? Of being pressed to look up just to be met with a boot in your face every time? To come to know &amp;quot;hope&amp;quot; as a poisonous and toxic thing? So what if I do somehow manage to come up with next weeks rent. What about the one after that or after that. You want me to look forward to another 63 years on this earth without taking a moment to consider how exhausting that sounds to someone like me. How utterly unbearable that feels? 63 more years of having everything I dream of ripped to shreds. 63 more years of having all my efforts dismantled by a cold cruel world. 63 more years of torture. 63 more years of a desire less existence. You just like the vast majority of this world speak negativel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; y on a topic you couldn&amp;#39;t begin to comprehend. How could anyone who&amp;#39;s soul hasn&amp;#39;t been broken possibly understand what it&amp;#39;s like to not even remember what a desire to be alive feels like. Just because people like you feel fear over dying, doesn&amp;#39;t mean those of us who embrace the idea are wrong.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;Why would it be terrible? Because I won&amp;#39;t be here to bring kindnesses to this sick place, what makes you think anything in this world deserves what I have to offer in the first place?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m miserable right now lol. I don&amp;#39;t think about today I think about tomorrow. My good days are in your position honestly and I enjoy that every time I&amp;#39;m in that position. Life can hurt but there&amp;#39;s always a soft point. That&amp;#39;s what you need to hold onto&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;I really don&amp;#39;t have an opinion on suicide as if it&amp;#39;s wrong right that&amp;#39;s a personal decision I&amp;#39;m a libertarian. I&amp;#39;m just saying that your life doesn&amp;#39;t have to be hell it could be perfect it could be beautiful and it could all be worth it. When dying could be app for what? I mean there&amp;#39;s a purpose to even pain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;No because you have suffered so much for nothing you have meaning you have value. Much more than to just be thrown away like that&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me again: &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s at least why I don&amp;#39;t kill myself I have value I have meaning I have a purpose and since I was 7 I knew I had to suck it up take a hell of lifestyle because the next twenty weren&amp;#39;t going to be pretty. People hated me despised me. Still do. For no reason enough that it&amp;#39;s hard to get a job network make friends etc... But it&amp;#39;s all part of a plan for the future you just have to find your own tunnel and keep going and never look back. What helps you has to be you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t respond for almost an hour and that&amp;#39;s when I got on the phone with the suicide line then the police twice when I was about to give his information I said you there? And he replied&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yea I&amp;#39;m still here. I&amp;#39;m tired of being conscious though so I think I&amp;#39;m going to go to bed.y body feels tired enough to do it. Goodnight &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all the texts last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I told the police the wrong number and all that. Should I just try to find someone else and block this guy or do I continue to play his game or teach him a lesson? That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m tired of knowing what to do in this case. To get what I want to have peace to make him focus on something else idk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day it just feels like he&amp;#39;s playing me again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;How&amp;#39;s ur day&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;I just woke up from a nap. You got a solution to my dilemma?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;Of what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him: &amp;quot;How to come up with all of my rent? Cause if not then still as shitty as I was last night and this morning &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to want to get help either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;Oh last night? I wanted to ask you something?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;What&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;??&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Where did you go&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;I was wondering do you ever find it better to talk to someone about like your stress to alleviate it? Does it make it better for you? I know for me it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh I just did my laundry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know anything until Monday but I hope you don&amp;#39;t have to stress over that too much. It&amp;#39;s only one day away&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have the money for a therapist&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;Like Medicaid covers that though.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a young healthy white Male, they don&amp;#39;t help with stuff like that&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have insurance given to me because of that. Like it&amp;#39;s literally what they told me when I went to apply is those are the reasons I don&amp;#39;t qualify&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;They help with that all the time I&amp;#39;ve seen people in therapy ur age and gender all time. Anyone who applies with the lack of funds is qualified in the welfare office actually... And as a side note you told me you were Asian lol.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;I never told you I was Asian? You confuse me with other people often&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;AMD last time I went to get government aid they practically laughed at me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;No you said you were 3/4 Irish and two Asian countries you said it on the phone. I&amp;#39;ve never talked to anyone on the phone you said your aunt told you that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;Medicaid? It&amp;#39;s just a small application they get you approved as long as you show your paystubs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;I do it at pecos and flaminog it&amp;#39;s behind Panda Express near planet fitness&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;I could give you the address&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;I told you I&amp;#39;m 3/4 irish and a bunch of other stuff, some Asian ethnicities are on that list but it&amp;#39;s a long one and yea I&amp;#39;m telling you last time I went they didn&amp;#39;t give a fuck about me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;Ok maybe it was someone that didn&amp;#39;t know what they were talking about but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they&amp;#39;d approve you and you&amp;#39;d be able to talk to someone. I mean from my experience it really does help to talk about stress with someone. I mean it could alleviate your pain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;What the hell is talking going to do? How could that possibly change anything. Not to sound like a dick but really, how does that help me cover rent or get work I won&amp;#39;t get fuckes out of as soon as they don&amp;#39;t need me anymore. The only way to alleviate my stress is to end it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;What time are you coming out tomorrow?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;??&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;Yeah well it can help with the stress of your financial straights basically. Give you the tools in how to deal with it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;Morning&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t see how when they don&amp;#39;t offer things like that to people like me. If I had a kid sure they would help but I&amp;#39;m just me those things don&amp;#39;t care about people like me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have kids either lol yeah they help everyone hun not just people with kids single guys told me at precision they worked less hours to keep their food stamps in fact lol. They accept everyone&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Him:&amp;quot;They don&amp;#39;t accept everyone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:&amp;quot;Yeah they do all you have to do is fit their income requirements&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The. Silence haven&amp;#39;t heard from him I don&amp;#39;t know what to do to block him to call the cops or to pretend he&amp;#39;s saying none of this go forward? I still want to hook up with him as I&amp;#39;m very attracted to him. But I can&amp;#39;t figure out is he just playing me or is he really a crazy person? I actually do like him. But then I tend to like people like that are crazy so no surprise there.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"So, I've had issues with my mental health for as long as I can remember. This is the first time in a long time that I have been without medication (can't afford to go see the Doctor, even low cost ones.)

Things have gotten worse lately. Around Christmas,  I'm always a bit more depressed. I lost my dad around the holidays years ago. This year I lost my mom only a few days after the anniversary of my dad's passing. 

Not long after this, I wake up in the middle of the night. I guess I should note that I have a habit of checking for movement of breath if I see someone sleeping. After I wake up, it doesn't look like he is breathing (the blanket he was using made it hard to tell). I try to nudge him. Nothing.  I nudge him a few more times, still nothing. I grab his arm to shake him and his arm is ice cold (turns out he started sweating in the night and took his arms out from under the blankets to cool down).
I gasped loudly because he still hasn't woken up. I almost fall off the bed trying to turn the light on. He wakes up. He asks me what's wrong and I lose it. I break down crying.  I was so scared. 

Since then, I haven't been able to sleep at night. If I sleep, it's a couple of hours during the daylight. I don't know how much longer I can survive this way.

This is the first time in a long time that I have been without medication (can&amp;#39;t afford to go see the Doctor, even low cost ones.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have gotten worse lately. Around Christmas,  I&amp;#39;m always a bit more depressed. I lost my dad around the holidays years ago. This year I lost my mom only a few days after the anniversary of my dad&amp;#39;s passing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after this, I wake up in the middle of the night. I guess I should note that I have a habit of checking for movement of breath if I see someone sleeping. After I wake up, it doesn&amp;#39;t look like he is breathing (the blanket he was using made it hard to tell). I try to nudge him. Nothing.  I nudge him a few more times, still nothing. I grab his arm to shake him and his arm is ice cold (turns out he started sweating in the night and took his arms out from under the blankets to cool down).
I gasped loudly because he still hasn&amp;#39;t woken up. I almost fall off the bed trying to turn the light on. He wakes up. He asks me what&amp;#39;s wrong and I lose it. I break down crying.  I was so scared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I haven&amp;#39;t been able to sleep at night. If I sleep, it&amp;#39;s a couple of hours during the daylight. I don&amp;#39;t know how much longer I can survive this way. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Hello, this is my first ever post on Reddit! Be gentle with me... 

Basically, I am struggling with my life a bit at the moment, and I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it - I don’t like talking to my family about personal stuff, and I don’t have any friends with whom I’d feel comfortable talking about myself, and not feel like a nuisance. Strangers on the internet it is, then.

To give you some backstory, I am an early-thirties female who has always been prone to feelings of sadness, loneliness, unfulfillment - though I am hesitant to use the word ‘depressed’ because I have never been suicidal, think I do have some worth, and have always hoped that life will get better and I will be happy someday.

Nothing really bad has happened to me, but life has been quite disappointing so far - I grew up with a difficult father who was sometimes abusive, and a mother who always defended him and dismissed my concerns about his behavior (and still does). I was unpopular at school, then I went to university, which I thought was going to be wonderful, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. After university I had a string of unfulfilling jobs. I’m an honest person, and I know my lack of professional success is partly due to laziness - but I also think that getting a job and being successful professionally has a lot to do with luck and being in the right place at the right time, and I think I’ve also been really unlucky. I tried for a while to get into the museum/heritage sector and did quite a bit of volunteering, and a few years back I tried to get into library work and applied for some library traineeships, none of which I got so much as an interview for.

The best thing I have done in my adult life is to get the frick out of my home country (England) and away from my family 6 years ago. I travelled Asia, lived in Australia for a while and then two years ago I moved to France, where I currently am. 

Oh, did I mention that I’ve never had a boyfriend? Yeah.

I have mostly worked as a waitress since coming to France but a few months ago I decided to train as an EFL teacher. It was a month-long intensive course, which I had to stay in a different European city to do as the city I live in doesn’t offer it. It was one of the hardest, but also one of the best things I have ever done. I had 9-5 classes every day and spent most of my evenings and weekends studying, so it was stressful, but it also felt great to be so busy and have so much going on in my life. The other people on my course were all lovely and, although I stayed in an apartment by myself, I never got lonely, because I was so busy and had plenty of interaction with my coursemates. It was everything my university experience wasn’t. 

Anyway, since coming back from the course a couple of months ago, I have struggled to live my life productively. I should be feeling excited about my new career and finally having a profession, but I’m not. My life has gone from full to empty. A language school in my city has given me a few classes to teach, but I’m still only working a couple of hours a week and am mostly relying on benefits to survive. My EFL course showed me that I AM capable of working hard and using my time wisely - I had no choice because otherwise I’d have failed the course - but, now that I have the option of doing nothing, I just do nothing. My worst habits are waking up late (like 11am), and spending most of my waking hours lying in bed playing with my smartphone. Even when I ban myself from social media sites, I still find other ways to waste time on the internet. Despite almost all my time being free, I struggle to get anything done and feel as though I have ‘no time’ for anything.

Unsurprisingly, these behaviors are making me feel like shit. I am also suffering from a lack of social interaction. I haven’t made many friends since moving to my current city two years ago, and I haven’t socialised since I came back from my course two months ago (apart from spending one week with my family at Christmas). The vast majority of my time is spent alone (I rent a room through a property guardianship organization and don’t speak much to the other people in my building). 

Oh, and being a British citizen in France with Brexit looming is not exactly doing wonders for my mental state.

I’m stuck in a rut that I desperately want to get out of. Even without a job, I could still be living a much fuller and happier life - applying for jobs, reading, making art, going for walks, meeting friends, cooking - not staying indoors not speaking to anyone and staring at my phone (much as I am doing at this very second).

I desperately want to be ‘living my best life’ (corny expression, but I like it) but I think that right now the most important thing for me is to get more teaching work so that my life has more structure, and start socializing again. But in order to do that I really need to overcome the toxic habits mentioned above that are hindering my productiveness and making me feel like crap. Today was the first day I didn’t even bother to shower, get dressed or make even a token attempt at productivity.

About a year ago, I had suffered the worst of my anorexia, and that time it really just took over my life. I would sit in class with lots of unfinished homework and instead of doing something about it, I just kept obsessing, meal planning, calculating, looking at thinspo, etc. It was taking time from my day the way a full time job would. I was so sad, and felt so empty, that it was really the only thing that made me feel happy.

My grades dropped drastically, so did my weight, and I freaked out. I promised myself I would take a break. It was really just a huge breaking point in my life.
Of course, an eating disorder doesn't just go away, so it only made me feel more and more worthless, especially combined with everything else going on in my life. 
Before I realised it, my self worth has dropped so much, that I had to stop myself from crying and apologising after my best friend helped me move something large into our dorm room, and I just felt that I wasted her 3min that she could have spent doing something else. I feel like shit trying to accept any help from anyone at all, and it's becoming a huge problem.
I've stopped sharing my problems and feeling with anyone and everyone, and I have a feeling that it might just be because I let myself gain weight and I lost everything that held me together....

I feel so so worthless, so hopeless, so extremely tired no matter what time of day it is, and I'm doing everything I can at the moment to help myself, but I'm so scared of asking for help, because I feel like I'm being almost selfish and like I'm wasting people's time on me.
I've gone through many times when I was suicidal, but I don't even feel like I deserve that anymore. That'd be inconvenient for everyone. I even entertained that thought at my lowest points, and came to the conclusion that I would have to sell everything I own, give my pets good new homes, basically pay for my funeral before it happens, and lose as much weight as humanely possible so that it'd be easy to clean up after my body, and so it'd be light to lift up for the people taking it away. At least this is stopping me from doing anything reckless, so I have the time to snap out of it. 

Now I'm taking 2 courses, while I usually can take 3 or 4, and I haven't turned in any of my assignments on week 2 of school... I just can't get the motivation, and I feel so incredibly tired all the time. I waste most of my energy on stressing over everything. Getting food, taking a shower, or doing anything at all makes me anxious. Being in class makes me so anxious that I feel physically sick. Add to this the anxiety I've had for years including things like being afraid that I make too much noice when walking, or that I'm breathing weird, or being afraid if wearing both my headphones when listening to music because I'm scared I'll make a sound without realising it or that I'll breath too loudly without noticing. I'm even stressed about the way I might look when I walk, which makes me afraid that I walk weirdly BECAUSE I think about it too much... Recently I've become anxious over watching YouTube on full screan, and I have absolutely no idea why. It's such an intense feeling of anxiety, almost fear or sorrow that it twists my stomach, and makes me lightheaded if I let it get too far.
I am constantly angry, because I'm just so irritated by all this anxiety, and I'm so angry about being the way I am, because in my mind I am an absolute idiot, below average intelligence, and I feel like I look and act like I have down syndrome or something, but everyone has always told me the exact opposite thing. It's the most infuriating this ever. 

I'm so fucked up about all this, and I am so scared that I'll disappoint my mother. Not to mention that I want to be a good example for my little sibling who means the world to me.

Right now the only thing that makes me happy is my research and my animals, and for both I barely have enough time. I can only feel fine when I spend time with them, or when I'm writing my book.

I hate being lazy, and I go crazy if I have nothing to do. I need to be busy, but I am so damn sad, and so tired that I just can't do anything no matter how much I want to... 

I need to manage those two courses I have now, and I'm seriously considering just taking a break from school, and going to work for a little while instead. I have no time to even manage these things in my head, there is so much going on, and I'm so extremely overwhelmed...

,mentalhealth,"I'm usually very controlled with my alcohol. I don't drink often and when I do it's usually a glass of beer or a mild cocktail after a reasonably heavy meal. Before yesterday, I have never been drunk or high in my entire life.

Also, I know I get sad (depressed?) sometimes with occassional suicidal ideation. This started after I broke up with my ex last year and flares up on significant dates like on birthdays and holidays. I haven't sought help but it's infrequent enough that it doesn't affect my work and social life.

Yesterday I decided to throw caution to the wind and drank several shots of gin (can't remember how many) on an empty stomach at a party consisting mostly of work colleagues. I don't remember much about what happened when I was drunk but I recall screaming for my colleagues to kill me or let me die. I remember crying and begging them to let me jump out the window. I woke up with scratches and bruises on my body and a bloody toe.

None of my colleagues seem to acknowledge what happened. I don't know if they are pretending nothing happened or if I just imagined the whole thing. A few that I asked said I mumbled a bit and went to sleep, which contradicts my injuries. I don't know what the alcohol did to me. I don't know if this is normal when people get drunk. 

I hope someone can advise me what to do. Should I seek help from a mental health professional? Or would it be enough just to abstain from alcohol from now on?

,mentalhealth,"Just for backstory of the two things that may be related, I smoked weed around once every fortnite but haven't since last Friday (10th january) and I had my bottom braces put on Wednesday this week, and was on paracetamol and ibuprofen. Since Thursday I have been having this thing where I suddenly feel really distant, and almost high but not really, more just that my awareness and reaction time is dropped with less control over my body, and I dont think about what I say.

,mentalhealth,"Although I am not sure, but I assume I have mild OCD of type: Checkers. I basically get intrusive thoughts telling me to check that the lid of my water bottle is closed tight before going to sleep.   
And sometimes, when I unplug a certain power cord, these intrusive thoughts force me to make 100% sure that I unplugged the power cord. Or similar and less intrusive ones. But they're weak enough for me to just block them out (except for the bottle-lid one, as it's a little harder for some reason to block it). It all started a couple years ago for some reason that I am unaware of.

&amp;#x200B;

English is my second language. Now, throughout my day, I always experience weird intrusive thoughts that question the grammar of certain sentences in English. For example: I get a thought asking me: ""Is it: these types of things, or these type of things?"", this is just one example, if I decide to completely block that thought, I will do fine until another thought of the same kind pops up in my head. But if I decide to act upon the thought and inquire the correct grammar, I will get confused and really anxious. I really can't prove these English grammar structures which is why I choose to completely block these thoughts. I really speak English instinctively, I learned it while growing up. I wasn't taught it with grammar structures like adjectives, past, present, adverb and other things.  


Now English isn't the only case. It also occurs when I do Math, intrusive thoughts pop up in my head telling me to prove certain things such as why you can't cancel certain fractions algebraically. And these thoughts are more intrusive than the English ones, they really scratch my head and disrupt my focus from learning new things until I prove why you can't do certain things or why a certain thing works the way it does. Hell, I'm not even a mathematician, but I have to use everything I know to prove why it is the way it is. I believe these thoughts are more intrusive and harder to block because I can prove certain things in Math unlike in English where I can't prove grammar rules (as I don't know how to). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the most part, these thoughts don't occur in day-to-day exchanges of information, such as recalling a friend's name, writing down something, buying groceries, browsing the web and other day-to-day things.

,mentalhealth,"(Originally posted to r/AmITheAsshole but got taken down for mentions of self harm and suicide so i thought this sub might be a better place for it)


This might be a bit of a validation post, if I'm being honest. I'm angry and sad and very lost on what to do and feel seriously guilty and keep doubting myself on whether I actually want to do this.


I am a 16-year-old trans/nonbinary teenager. Please, if you're going to mention something about how I'm mentally ill or just trying to be trendy or some bullshit, leave. I don't want those comments because, frankly, I hear them every day and don't need to be reminded again. 


My parents don't fully know about my gender identity. I attempted to tell them when I was 14, but they basically told me I was just a tomboy and it has never been brought up again. My dad thinks being trans is a mental illness and transitioning to match your identity is equivalent to self harm. They know I've wanted a haircut for years. I bug my mom about it every couple days. My mom gets seriously angry at me for it because she's annoyed with my nagging, but I'm also annoyed because there are a lot worse things I could be doing to my body than just cutting my hair. I could be out fucking everyone who'll have me and getting a fucking drug addiction, but I'm not and never would. All I want is a damn haircut. She's straight-up told me, ""you're a girl and I don't want you to have a boy's haircut."" At least she's not using shitty excuses anymore and actually being honest. Doesn't make it any less ridiculous tho.


It's gotten to the level where I'm just angry all the time at everyone and everything because I feel so out of control. It's of course not *just* the hair that's causing it. It's a lot of things they've done that have hurt me, things that have affected my relationships with other people and my own mental health. Just the general knowledge that my parents refuse to accept me for who I am. The hair is just an offset of that.


I have a history of depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts and this whole ordeal has put me back into an extreme dark place. I'm worried for my own health at this point, and I know some people will see this and think ""come on -- it's just a haircut"", but it goes so much beyond that. It goes into feelings of never being good enough, of feeling like a trophy to my parents, of having my appearance matter more to them than my comfort, of just feeling extremely invaluable to them as a whole, of knowing that they do not show the same respect for me that I do for them. It's caused me to act out and get into rather large arguments with them lately and I feel sick and sad all the time.


Maybe this post doesn't even belong on this sub. I'm unsure of where I should post. But would I be the asshole if went and got my hair cut without their permission/against their explicit wishes?? Is it illegal for me to do so?? Would the hair stylist get in trouble because they cut a minor's hair without parents' permission?? I don't want anyone else to get in trouble due to my actions either. Should I just tough it out another couple years so I can get a haircut then??


Again, I think this is kind of a validation post and I apologize. I just need to know I'm not alone in this. I need to know that I'm not being stupid or sensitive.",t2_3l7zl6bi,False,,0,False,Would I be in the wrong for getting my hair cut against my parent's explicit wishes?,[],r/mentalhealth,False,,,0,,False,t3_eqzpjg,False,dark,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1579485790.0,text,,,,text,self.mentalhealth,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Originally posted to &lt;a href=""/r/AmITheAsshole""&gt;r/AmITheAsshole&lt;/a&gt; but got taken down for mentions of self harm and suicide so i thought this sub might be a better place for it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be a bit of a validation post, if I&amp;#39;m being honest. I&amp;#39;m angry and sad and very lost on what to do and feel seriously guilty and keep doubting myself on whether I actually want to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a 16-year-old trans/nonbinary teenager. Please, if you&amp;#39;re going to mention something about how I&amp;#39;m mentally ill or just trying to be trendy or some bullshit, leave. I don&amp;#39;t want those comments because, frankly, I hear them every day and don&amp;#39;t need to be reminded again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents don&amp;#39;t fully know about my gender identity. I attempted to tell them when I was 14, but they basically told me I was just a tomboy and it has never been brought up again. My dad thinks being trans is a mental illness and transitioning to match your identity is equivalent to self harm. They know I&amp;#39;ve wanted a haircut for years. I bug my mom about it every couple days. My mom gets seriously angry at me for it because she&amp;#39;s annoyed with my nagging, but I&amp;#39;m also annoyed because there are a lot worse things I could be doing to my body than just cutting my hair. I could be out fucking everyone who&amp;#39;ll have me and getting a fucking drug addiction, but I&amp;#39;m not and never would. All I want is a damn haircut. She&amp;#39;s straight-up told me, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re a girl and I don&amp;#39;t want you to have a boy&amp;#39;s haircut.&amp;quot; At least she&amp;#39;s not using shitty excuses anymore and actually being honest. Doesn&amp;#39;t make it any less ridiculous tho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s gotten to the level where I&amp;#39;m just angry all the time at everyone and everything because I feel so out of control. It&amp;#39;s of course not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the hair that&amp;#39;s causing it. It&amp;#39;s a lot of things they&amp;#39;ve done that have hurt me, things that have affected my relationships with other people and my own mental health. Just the general knowledge that my parents refuse to accept me for who I am. The hair is just an offset of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a history of depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts and this whole ordeal has put me back into an extreme dark place. I&amp;#39;m worried for my own health at this point, and I know some people will see this and think &amp;quot;come on -- it&amp;#39;s just a haircut&amp;quot;, but it goes so much beyond that. It goes into feelings of never being good enough, of feeling like a trophy to my parents, of having my appearance matter more to them than my comfort, of just feeling extremely invaluable to them as a whole, of knowing that they do not show the same respect for me that I do for them. It&amp;#39;s caused me to act out and get into rather large arguments with them lately and I feel sick and sad all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this post doesn&amp;#39;t even belong on this sub. I&amp;#39;m unsure of where I should post. But would I be the asshole if went and got my hair cut without their permission/against their explicit wishes?? Is it illegal for me to do so?? Would the hair stylist get in trouble because they cut a minor&amp;#39;s hair without parents&amp;#39; permission?? I don&amp;#39;t want anyone else to get in trouble due to my actions either. Should I just tough it out another couple years so I can get a haircut then??&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"(F19) Hi all,
I’ve been having on-off episodes where I feel very down and depressed and lonely. I feel anxious about other people and my lack of friends, and then I get really down and feel very alone. However, since they only came on and off again- I’d have brief periods of happiness, then deep depressive episodes which didn’t last too long- I wrote it off as a non-problem.

However, a few days ago I had a severe episode where I had some awful thoughts about being alone and hurting myself and drank a dangerous amount, making myself really sick. It might have been worse, had my friend not been there to help me. It’s this that’s made me think that something has to change, and I need to confront this problem before I  have another episode.

What would you guys recommend? I’m not sure what direction to go in- for all I know, I could be overreacting, and there’s nothing wrong. Would you recommend I talk to a GP about this?

i was dumped 2 days ago, by someone i thought was the love of my life. recently, my mental health was getting worse, i was overthinking more, i was crying more, i was pulling myself away more. this has happened before, a year prior. when i met my former boyfriend, i told him when i was low, and i said i may be like that again. he promised to stay and look after me if it ever happens. we never argued, we never had disagreements, when we were sad we talked it out. everyone thought we would last. everyone thought we were soulmates. so did we. i have been diagnosed with having anxiety, depression, and being hyper sensitive. 
around November 2019, i started to dip into my depression again. i told him this, he supported me, he said he’d never leave. he spent everyday together, he held me and made me feel okay again. i told him if i ever get too much, he could tell me. he promised me he would never give up on me. i believed him. he started talking to his ex on snapchat, but they were together only in the 2nd year of high school. so a while ago now, they were 13. but he said he was really hurt by her. i started seeing a physiologist again, once a week. but i felt it didn’t help. but he was so proud of me, i was doing it for him. 
January 14th, he said that he was starting to be in a bad mindset too, and that he believed my mental illness was caused by him. we nearly broke up, but i convinced him it wasn’t him, because it truly wasn’t. he stayed and everything felt normal again. but ever since then, i cried every night thinking that it would happen again, he would try leave me, i would be alone. January 17th, he came to my house, i cried constantly because i felt he was going to leave me, but he held me and he promised me he’d never ever leave me. i believed him. i fell asleep in his arms, and i woke up crying even harder, believing he would leave and he held me tighter and told me he never would. he cuddled me while my father drove him home, the last thing he said was “i love you, i’ll never leave” and he got out the car and put his hands into a heart shape and waved goodbye, walked into his house. that night he told me he wasn’t feeling great, i told him to speak to his mother because she might be able to help. his mother said he should break up with me, i don’t know why. that night, i called him, sobbing my eyes out, my mother had to come and talk to him because i couldn’t. i cried so hard. he left me and told me he felt he wasn’t good enough. we were together for nearly a year. nothing felt real in the situation. he wouldn’t stop saying how much he loved me, how much he cared for me, how he never wanted to leave but thought he had to, to work on himself. i let him. but my heart won’t let me leave him alone. i keep messaging him, telling him how i feel, how worried i am about him. i’ve been speaking to him ever since, i know it’s wrong. but he’s been talking to me too, he’s been replying to my private story, when he sees i’m sad. i tell him he shouldn’t be he tells me he wants to. he tells me he still loves me, he misses me. but today i asked him if he still saw a future with me, he said he didn’t know, he didn’t think so. but only because he thought he wasn’t good enough, he feels i’m still good enough for him, but he’s no good for me. he was my happiness while the world was falling down. i can’t sleep, i can’t eat, i worry so much about him. i worry he will never come back, like i will never become better again. i miss him. but he’s blocked him location from me, he says he needs space. he’s taken me off his private stories, but he says he still wants on mine. he still says he loves me, he cares for me. his feelings haven’t changed. he never lies. i’m so scared, i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to be replaced. i keep feeling like his ex will replace me, i know they speak a lot, i’m scared she’s part of the reason why he’s gone. he keeps telling me he still loves me, he still misses me. but he says he’ll never come back. 
i speak to my mother and dad who have both been through mental health and relationships with it, they say they think he will come back, to give him time. they saw how much he cared for me, they thought themselves we would last. they treated him like a son. i don’t know what to do guys, someone else give me advise. i keep checking on him, when i was still able to, i kept checking his location, to see if he was okay. not to hurt himself, if he was with his ex, if he was ignoring me. if he was okay. i’m still so so so worried. i miss him so much, and i want him back so bad. i need him so bad right now. i’m heart broken. can someone please give me advise. please don’t hate on me, i’m trying my best to get through this. but i still believe he was my soulmate, and he even says he still believes too. is his mental health taking over his feelings? or will he really never come back? someone please help. i need help. thank you for reading",t2_5hbd0jsu,False,,0,False,"A hard breakup, i need advise (serious reply’s only)",[],r/mentalhealth,False,,,0,,False,t3_eqy3jo,False,dark,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1579478818.0,text,,,,text,self.mentalhealth,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, i’ve never used reddit before so idk how to do this, or if it’s okay to post it on here lol.

January 17th, he came to my house, i cried constantly because i felt he was going to leave me, but he held me and he promised me he’d never ever leave me. i believed him. i fell asleep in his arms, and i woke up crying even harder, believing he would leave and he held me tighter and told me he never would. he cuddled me while my father drove him home, the last thing he said was “i love you, i’ll never leave” and he got out the car and put his hands into a heart shape and waved goodbye, walked into his house. that night he told me he wasn’t feeling great, i told him to speak to his mother because she might be able to help. his mother said he should break up with me, i don’t know why. that night, i called him, sobbing my eyes out, my mother had to come and talk to him because i couldn’t. i cried so hard. he left me and told me he felt he wasn’t good enough. we were together for nearly a year. nothing felt real in the situation. he wouldn’t stop saying how much he loved me, how much he cared for me, how he never wanted to leave but thought he had to, to work on himself. i let him. but my heart won’t let me leave him alone. i keep messaging him, telling him how i feel, how worried i am about him. i’ve been speaking to him ever since, i know it’s wrong. but he’s been talking to me too, he’s been replying to my private story, when he sees i’m sad. i tell him he shouldn’t be he tells me he wants to. he tells me he still loves me, he misses me. but today i asked him if he still saw a future with me, he said he didn’t know, he didn’t think so. but only because he thought he wasn’t good enough, he feels i’m still good enough for him, but he’s no good for me. he was my happiness while the world was falling down. i can’t sleep, i can’t eat, i worry so much about him. i worry he will never come back, like i will never become better again. i miss him. but he’s blocked him location from me, he says he needs space. he’s taken me off his private stories, but he says he still wants on mine. he still says he loves me, he cares for me. his feelings haven’t changed. he never lies. i’m so scared, i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to be replaced. i keep feeling like his ex will replace me, i know they speak a lot, i’m scared she’s part of the reason why he’s gone. he keeps telling me he still loves me, he still misses me. but he says he’ll never come back. 
i speak to my mother and dad who have both been through mental health and relationships with it, they say they think he will come back, to give him time. they saw how much he cared for me, they thought themselves we would last. they treated him like a son. i don’t know what to do guys, someone else give me advise. i keep checking on him, when i was still able to, i kept checking his location, to see if he was okay. not to hurt himself, if he was with his ex, if he was ignoring me. if he was okay. i’m still so so so worried. i miss him so much, and i want him back so bad. i need him so bad right now. i’m heart broken. can someone please give me advise. please don’t hate on me, i’m trying my best to get through this. but i still believe he was my soulmate, and he even says he still believes too. is his mental health taking over his feelings? or will he really never come back? someone please help. i need help. thank you for reading&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently taking celexa, trazodone, and birth control. Celexa for depression, trazodone for insomnia, and birth control just for my period cramps.

Trazodone works amazing for me, I always fall asleep whenever I want after I take it. It also always gives me vivid dreams while I sleep, which I used to never experience, so it's a nice touch.

I think my celexa works alright too, probably more than I realize. Sometimes I run out of, forget to take, or just don't feel like taking my meds and it's always a grave mistake. Only thing is is that I'm super tired, like, 24/7 now which is kind of the opposite of how I was before my meds.

,mentalhealth,"I’m trying adaptogens mainly for my daily anxiety i get now, and maybe it’ll ease my depression.
I’m trying Rhodiola this time - i recently have tried Ashwagandha, Holy Basil and now this one.  Ashwagandha (300,600, then 1200 mg) i tried for 5 months.
Holy Basil (450mg) tried for 2 months. (started to get impatient bc no effect)
So the previous adaptogens have no had much luck with me. 

I’m not sure if it’s because I don’t know how to identify the feeling of relief from anxiety/depression, because i’ve had generalized anxiety &amp; low mood/depression most of my life so it’s like i REALLY don’t know or know how to know, the feeling of being ‘not depressed’ or ‘not anxious’ because i’ve always felt it. 

So i’m in day 5 &amp; been taking 300mg (1 capsule) to start, and when i hit 1 week or maybe even like 10 days, i will double the dose to the “recommended dose” given which is 600mg. 

If you’ve tried this, or any adaptogen really, what did you notice? 

Did you feel yourself not get worried about something that once did? 
Did it make you sleepy ? (heard it can have that calming affect but i have yet to experience that)

I’m trying Rhodiola this time - i recently have tried Ashwagandha, Holy Basil and now this one.  Ashwagandha (300,600, then 1200 mg) i tried for 5 months.
Holy Basil (450mg) tried for 2 months. (started to get impatient bc no effect)
So the previous adaptogens have no had much luck with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if it’s because I don’t know how to identify the feeling of relief from anxiety/depression, because i’ve had generalized anxiety &amp;amp; low mood/depression most of my life so it’s like i REALLY don’t know or know how to know, the feeling of being ‘not depressed’ or ‘not anxious’ because i’ve always felt it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i’m in day 5 &amp;amp; been taking 300mg (1 capsule) to start, and when i hit 1 week or maybe even like 10 days, i will double the dose to the “recommended dose” given which is 600mg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve tried this, or any adaptogen really, what did you notice? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you feel yourself not get worried about something that once did? 
Did it make you sleepy ? (heard it can have that calming affect but i have yet to experience that)
Was your dose the recommended amount or was it more/less?
Did you add any other adaptogens or herbal remedies that helped increase the adaptogenic affect ?&lt;/p&gt;

I tried doing my first internship last year but literally anything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong. The people were always yelling at me and being verry rude.

It felt like I was back in highschool, this one time, these adults would sat at a table during lunch, i would go sit at their table and try to socialise despite my anxiety. When they saw me they all got up, and sat at another table leaving me alone. 

Ofcourse me being a instable anxious mess, had anxiety and panick attacks on the daily. I left crying, cried all night and cried when i had to back. Eventuelly i ended this internship, failed the course and had to do an extra year of college.

Now a year later I have to try again. I’m terrified and i don’t know how to get through this. This internship lasts 3 months, the next one lasts 6 months. After this i can finally graduate... but i just don’t know how to get through this..

,mentalhealth,"Read my previous posts and you will see pretty much depressive posts exclusively. A week ago I had a breakdown that left me afraid I would hurt myself soon. It was unbelievably scary. The day after, on Monday, I felt all calm and relaxed. It was so weird. Less than a day before I was crying my eyes out feeling afraid I would hurt myself. Now, here I was, calm and relaxed. Not only did I feel calm and relaxed, but I also felt optimistic. I felt like this is the year I will see improvements. I turn 24 in a few weeks, and so far, my 20’s have been just full of depressive periods. But... 2020 is the year things will change. I am going to start making friends and, after I’ve started making friends, I am going to start dating people. And this is all happening this year. I’ve been a loner for 14 years, but I won’t be a loner for 15 years. This is the year everything changes.

I don’t think I’ve ever felt this optimistic about my social and my romantic life. Certainly not in many, many years. I had completely given up. I’ve been trying to accept life as a loner for years now. This is very weird but also very real. Perhaps it’s the fact that, because of how I felt on Sunday in regards to harming myself, I know I cannot allow for anything else to happen. It HAS to work. And it HAS to work this year. I’m not sure I could go on like this for another year or two. So this will be the year things changes.

What have I done so far? I’ve reached out to my cousin who has never been in a similar situation. She is very kind and supportive and has offered to help me through this. I will start attending a biweekly gaming evening at the university, and I will also attend a speed friending event at the university next month. I do my best to keep negativity out of my life now. Anyone who doesn’t seem supportive or is kind of negative towards me will be out of my life. Oh and I also want to see if there is any speed dating events in my city. Not the biggest city in the world but I am sure there must be something. If not, I will check out some online dating stuff and ask my cousin for some help. Or maybe my new group of friends will be helpful too. Perhaps one of them is someone I’d be interested in dating. Or perhaps some of them know someone looking for a date.

,mentalhealth,"Hey guys, this might be one of the craziest posts that you have ever read on here (I am pretty sure). First, I have suffered from severe health anxiety and OCD my whole life (I am 21). OCD is a genetic thing for me, as my father also has it. Basically, I get super scared when something happens to my health, even if there is no apparent reason. What does this have to do with hookah? Let me explain...

An incident happened exactly 3 years ago, where I fainted after taking deep hits in a hookah bar (unexperienced smoker). After this incident, I lived perfectly fine for about 1,5 years. Then, I read some German articles that were published at the time which severely triggered my health anxiety. I then made this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/9v3fow/bad\_hookah\_experience\_should\_i\_be\_worried/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/9v3fow/bad_hookah_experience_should_i_be_worried/)

The next months (I was taking a gap year after high school to build my business), I fell into a deep hole of anxiety and depression because I now thought that there was something wrong with me because of carbon monoxide poisoning (Which does not really make sense, since I never noticed anything being wrong with me during that 1.5 year span: I excelled in high school, built a business on the side, even got into a highly ranked university). You can read it in the post, but after I fainted, I felt perfectly fine (no more symptoms), so I did not go to the ER. Basically, in the articles it says that you have to get oxygen treatment immediately after, to get the CO out of your system, otherwise you risk permanent brain damage/cognitive issues etc.. I did not know that at the time, and since I was feeling so good after fainting, I thought I had just oversmoked (I was blowing rings and holding the smoke in) , so I did not go to the ER, which I now DEEPLY regret.

So I have talked to over 5 doctors about this, all of them told me I had nothing to worry about and even thought I was crazy lol. I was taking antidepressants for the first time to calm me down, and somehow after a few months I overcame my anxiety and started living normally again. I was super proud of myself and thinking ""how did you waste months dwelling on something that stupid??"" I was 10 months free of anxiety (just stopped thinking about it), doing super well, got into a highly university in September, got very good grades, but then in November, I was burning myself out because I was working/studying almost 100 hours per week, and then I started obsessing about that incident again. I had a complete mental breakdown because my thoughts were driving me crazy again, feelings of guilt: ""Why didnt you go to the ER??"", ""You are not as smart as you could have been...""

I began researching again, and became even more anxious. I was risking to drop out of university, started neglecting studying and socializing because my anxiety was just too much(How crazy does that sound??) Basically, now I am back on antidepressants and I began doing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with a psychiatrist to help me. I know this is a mental illness that I have (OCD), but it was triggered again only because of some stupid incident in a hookah bar. At the time, I did not think of it as a big deal (the articles were not published back then), but me being a hypochondriac, I just cannot deal with scary health information that I read online.

I have not smoked ever since, because it has left me truly traumatized. I really think I developed some form of PTSD because of it. I know that I am overly exaggerating things but I just wish I had never touched a hookah (even though I enjoyed it from time to time), because of all the stress it has brought me. As an extremely anxious person, I have never done any drugs etc. and since hookah is a really big thing here (70% of all 18-25 yr olds have tried it at least once here), I never thought that I was putting my health at a bigger risk. I really feel like I am stuck in the past, unable to look forward. My anxiety is telling me to go see another 10 doctors, but I know that it will not change shit. I just want to live my life again without thinking that there is something wrong with my health.

Sometimes I want to go back and change it, but I cannot... I know that fainting has happened to many people from smoking hookah, and that it can have various reasons (lack of oxygen, nicotine, standing up too quickly etc.), but the fact that it could have been carbon monoxide poisoning is just making me nuts (I cannot even google it anymore because it makes me feel extremely anxious). I have never put drugs inside my body, but at this point I see myself having damaged my health the same way as a heroin addict.

It is quite ironic that the thing that I used to calm down on the weekends ends up giving me the most stress in my life. I do not know why I am even making this post. Maybe I just want people telling me that I am in fact crazy, which I already know. Maybe its just to distract me from googling specialists in hyperbaric oxygen treatment in my area, which I have already done several times this week. Or maybe I just wanted to share my crazy obsessive thoughts that have tortured me for the last months/years and that I was never able to share with anyone. I am feeling a bit hopeless, not gonna lie.

The antidepressants are working well and I am doing a bit better now. I just have to get my shit together and not let a single incident dictate the rest of my life (I mean, there are people that had way worse things happen to them??). I overcame this anxiety once, so chances are, that I will be able to do it again... If someone has some helpful life advice, I would really appreciate it. If not, then at least I have provided you with an insight as to how OCD thoughts can mess somebody up...",t2_4n70jaj1,False,,0,False,I wish I had never touched a hookah...,[],r/mentalhealth,False,,,0,,False,t3_eqzc07,False,dark,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,self,1579455628.0,,[],{},,True,,1579484154.0,text,,,,text,self.mentalhealth,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, this might be one of the craziest posts that you have ever read on here (I am pretty sure).

&lt;p&gt;The antidepressants are working well and I am doing a bit better now. I just have to get my shit together and not let a single incident dictate the rest of my life (I mean, there are people that had way worse things happen to them??). I overcame this anxiety once, so chances are, that I will be able to do it again... If someone has some helpful life advice, I would really appreciate it. If not, then at least I have provided you with an insight as to how OCD thoughts can mess somebody up...&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"I live in California.

I went to my primary doctor the other day about my frequent memory loss.  During this visit the doctor told me that I have had anxiety disorder, and has diagnosed me with it a while ago, but I wasn't informed (or he told me and I forgot.  go figure). He said I need a Neurocognitive evaluation. On Friday, after calling out from work to handle important things, I had probably the worst day in my life in a VERY LONG time, and had, I guess it was, a 3.5 hour anxiety attack. So now I'm also wanting to get on anxiety medicine because I don't want my life held hostage for hours by any more attacks.

The big problem is it has been affecting my work badly. I'm forgetting things, and it's greatly straining my job position. I keep getting talked to and they are getting more serious and I feel I'm getting very close to having my job in jeopardy.  **I can't lose my job**.  I'm moving into a studio apartment in a week to get out of a bad living situation.  If I lose my job, or even get demoted I won't be able to afford the place.

So, tomorrow I am calling a Psychiatrist office near my new apartment about anxiety medicine.  I am also waiting to hear from my health insurance about a where I can go to do the evaluation that is in-network. I can't go to an emergency room because the visit would financially make it where I can't pay the 1st month rent. But work has expressed that the expectation of my job requires me to be able to handle it immediately. I'm thinking they are tired of my explication/excuses even though they say they are supportive. (""We are supportive, but we need to have these things you are messing up fixed now"").

So....is there a paperwork I can ask the psychiatrist and psychologist when I see them that says ""Here is what we are working on to correct Triox's mental problems, and it may take some time to kick in"" that I can give to my job, so that they can't just write me up/fire me on the next mistake?

,mentalhealth,"does anyone else have this thing where they are paranoid about the safety of food?

I can eat the foods, but if I - at any point - get an idea in my head that it may not be safe (cooking chicken etc) I'm paranoid about it nd it makes me really struggle to eat it.

Particular foods include rice, pasta, chicken, pork, eggs, untoasted crumpets and muffins, oranges, bananas and more I can't even think of right now.

one example is of rice I was cooking for a curry. it was boiling and I strained it, and I tried a bit to see if it was cooked. It was still a bit hard to chew - meaning I hadn't left it long enough. This automatically made me extremely paranoid about its safety. I told my self to get over it, and it would be fine and served up my dinner. I got about 2 mouthfuls in and started thinking about it again. I literally couldn't eat the rice, so put it to the side, I was going to eat the chicken but then started worrying that the chicken wasn't cooked either, even though it was obvious it was. I ended up binning the entire dinner and having toast that night.

It's awful. My mum was eating boiled eggs the other day, and she said if was a bit runner than she liked. I automatically got really paranoid and worried that she was going to get ill from it. She is fine, and said it was cooked just funnier, but I saw it that it was raw. And she was going to get food poisoning.",t2_4wy6m622,False,,0,False,"I'm paranoid about food safety?

It was still a bit hard to chew - meaning I hadn&amp;#39;t left it long enough. This automatically made me extremely paranoid about its safety. I told my self to get over it, and it would be fine and served up my dinner. I got about 2 mouthfuls in and started thinking about it again. I literally couldn&amp;#39;t eat the rice, so put it to the side, I was going to eat the chicken but then started worrying that the chicken wasn&amp;#39;t cooked either, even though it was obvious it was. I ended up binning the entire dinner and having toast that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s awful. My mum was eating boiled eggs the other day, and she said if was a bit runner than she liked. I automatically got really paranoid and worried that she was going to get ill from it. She is fine, and said it was cooked just funnier, but I saw it that it was raw. And she was going to get food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Little background : I'm 18 years old, I started watching porn at the age of 11 but I didn't have good internet back then so it was mostly masturbating to my imagination. At first it was no problem. Then soon I started getting overwhelmed by the feelings and I couldn't stop myself from watching porn even if others were sitting next to me ( obviously they didn't have clear view of the screen or me. )

Soon after I started getting into relationships. At first I thought that I really was in love with every girl from them, but recently I realized that I never felt love, it was just extremely strong sexual impulses. I never grabbed women or forced them or anything like that, but the thoughts never stopped. Never. For 7 freaking years, it's only been getting worse. A lot worse.

Sex and porn have been basically controlling my life. I stopped looking at women as other people whom I can form an emotional connection with. It was just the sex. As soon as I feel myself getting attached or something I gotta bail because I knew that it wasn't love it was just sexual.

Anyway I lost my V card at like 15 or so. It was horrible. Not because I didn't know what to do or because I didn't like the girl I was with, but because I didn't feel anything. I was thrusting like an animal but I still didn't feel anything. The first time I did it like that for 15 minutes and I just told her to stop. Second time I did it for a long time and I still didn't feel anything.

What I feel guilty about though is that sometimes I get a little rough during sex, like choking her and pulling her head closer when she's giving me a BJ until she gags. I don't mean to do it like that, I just get caught in the moment a lot.

And now I feel so guilty that I'm pretending to love a girl although I'm just using her for sex and I have no feelings for her.

What's really bad though is the amount of times it gets me in embarrassing situations, like getting caught kissing someone at school, having sex in the school bathroom, almost getting caught masturbating, people asking me why I take too long in the bathrooms, the countless times I got to school late because I woke up with a boner and had to jerk it off away because it hurts, not eating lunch because I spent lunch time jerking off ..

It's ruining my life, even when I was meaning to do homework and stuff I either start watching porn or get caught up sexting someone. On average I do it 2 times a day. Sometimes I get too busy all day and can't do it, but sometimes I'm free and do it 5 times, maybe even more.

I'm trying to study right now but I can't because I literally have 7 porn windows open that I'm going to watch.

I never talked about this to anyone and I can't because where I live sex is a taboo.

On the outside, I’m “normal”. When opportunities for promotion present themselves, coworkers ask me why I don’t go for them.

,mentalhealth,"My girlfriend just had a major episode/breakdown. She suffers greatly from abandonment issues and broke down crying hysterically for an hour or more, along with cutting herself slightly with a scissor (I was unaware of this at the time).

I am to blame as I just didn’t have the energy to console her when she needed me. We both were feeling a bit annoyed with each other once we got home from visiting my relatives. She wished me a goodnight a few hours later as a means to talk and be warm, but I wasn’t ready to talk as of yet. So this lead her to have a major episode. It was major because I still didn’t want to reaffirm her right away as I always do. This is very draining on me; always having to sacrifice my emotions, to help her feel better that she didn’t do anything wrong and not to worry about it. It feels like I’m never allowed to feel my emotions because she takes it personal as if she did something wrong and as if we have to break up right away (abandonment issues). 

So this time I just held out longer in apologizing while she was in the next room crying and cutting herself. Even after I checked on her and started to reassure her, it wasn’t enough to stop her from trying to leave, and crying even more, much more. 

In the end, I was able to console her and she feels much better and is asleep now. While I’m left feeling very drained, tremendously sadden for her wishing I can take away her pain, and be a better partner. But it all gets very draining. I’m human too and have my emotions and own issues. It’s very hard to put my emotions aside to help her feel better in a time when I should be allowed to feel my emotions. 

I also feel very emotional for her as her family is shit. She lost her sister to cancer when they were young, her mother abandoned her at a young age and her father is a narcissist. She’s in so much pain. I just wish I can be better for her, but scared as well that I can’t keep doing this. I suffer myself from issues and this is just too much pain. 

Her pain saddens me. She’s such an amazing person. Has so much potential. But is lost in thoughts and emotions out of her control. 

On top of it all, It’s so damn hard to find a decent place for her to go to for therapy. She has insurance but many places offer such bad care. If anyone knows of anything good trauma related therapy locations in NYC please let me know.

I have been growing closer to her and honestly been starting to think about marriage. Well, we got tipsy over dinner and I brought up marriage and we were having a really good discussion about it, and then I brought up that if we got married her debt and mine would consolidate and I would have to start paying more. I didn't word this well. Well, I'm an idiot. And she didn't take this well. Her father commit suicide around seven or eight years ago, and debt was one of the major reasons. So I try to smooth it over and it's not going well, and I'm making about me being upset. I had to go to the bathroom to have a panic attack about ruining another anniversary (last year I also did something stupid to ruin it).

,mentalhealth,"I moved away from my home state just over a year ago to be with my girlfriend. We are 2+ years strong now, and have had multiple conversations planning out our future. We both have good jobs, and solid plans to excel in our fields. I have been planning to propose to her at the end of April; essentially putting together what she has described as her dream proposal. 

Well it seems that my profession has proven to take a higher toll on my mental health than I anticipated (EMS), and my already baseline abrasive demeanor has gotten worse; even when I don't notice it. I've dealt with aggressive bouts of depression even before moving, and I've found myself in an extensive depressive state for quite some time now. 

My girlfriend literally just made it known that she doesn't see me as the guy she fell in love with anymore, and hasn't for the past 5-6 months or so. Don't get me wrong, shes not talking about any time apart or separation. However, she has said shes disappointed with who i've shown myself to be. 

The thought of ever letting it get to this point makes me sick to my stomach, and ashamed doesn't even scratch the surface of how I feel. I want to get back to how it was in the beginning where I happily went full-blown romantic casanova with her.

Here's where I'm stuck: when I was at my peak Romeo phase, I was happy. I was energetic, excited, and creative with so much shit I did. Now, i'm miserable 24/7. I need to fix myself in order to fix us, but I whole-heartedly don't know how.

,mentalhealth,"I've been feeling really in a rut these days. On weekdays I can function like a normal adult. I go to work, hang out with colleagues/friends etc. But when it comes to the weekends, I just can't get myself out of bed. The moment I wake up I just think to myself 'Fuck it's another day what the hell am I going to do.'  I can't get outta the bed and the only activity that I do is binge on videos or go on my phone.

,mentalhealth,"Hi reddit i am a 21 year old male and over the past 5 Years I have stuggled With life to the point Where i just dont know what to do any more

It all started When i was around 15-16 When i stopped going out and Communicating with my Friends Due to my low confidence, Then as the years progressed it developed into depression and Lonliness

I hardly Have any friends now because they are too busy with thier own lives and ive also never had a Girlfriend So im not Experienced With women Which makes it hard for me To develop a Relationship. Im also an Introvert as well, Would say im shy but i struggle With making connections

Im currently at School Studying Engineering hoping to progress onto uni and Get a Degree in mechanical Engineering But over the past few years i just cant seem to stick at a Job long enough Cause i Either get Bored and leave or i End up getting laid off

Over the past year ive been really Trying to put myself out there and i would Try to start Conversations With random people but i just cant seem to make a Connection with people. I find it pretty hard to communicate with random people

I see Groups of Friends and Couples With each other happy all the time But i just Wish i had what they had. I wish i could feel what it feels like to wanted Or ""Loved""

This really Hurt but the other day i was sitting at a bar on my Own and as i was sitting there this old guy came up to me and starting speaking to me, He then Told me that he was a psychologist For over 20 years and then Told me That I was a ""Ticking Time bomb"" and to get help

I wasnt even Doing anything apart From just Drinking a beer by myself But he then said that he knew by my body language and Communication skills that i was Struggling with life

This ex-psychologist Also Told me that he had a brother once Who Had the same Traits as me and he said that One day his brother ended up unfortiantly taking his own life

Dont get me wrong, This guy (Cant remember his name) was a Good person and so was his wife that he introduced me to But What he said Shook me.

I also Got Bullied When i was in School but it pisses me Off seeing the people Who use to bully me With better lives than myself. 

I was So close to beating the shit out of this guy Who use to bully me in school the other day cause it pissed me off seeing him With a Girlfriend, I felt like he doesnt Deserve a woman or to Experience love

I dont Know, I plan on just working hard in School so that i can hopefully land a High paying Job cause at least money will give me some Power

At least with money i could Buy what i want, It would make me feel a bit more happy and i could also Buy myself Woman if i wanted to so that i dont spend the rest of my life alone

People say money doesnt bring happiness but i know for a fact that my life Would be better with an Extra few Hundred Thousand in the bank

I think having more money would solve Alot of my problems Because i just dont have that much to offer. Well according to IQ tests i did once im classed as ""Intelligant"" (apparently my IQ is Around 137) But  apart From that i dont have much To offer

im not that Funny, I Find it hard To Make connections, I cant Flirt with women, Im Quiet, Im pretty good looking and Tall but im not a model But i just dont think i have much to offer

,mentalhealth,"Therapy doesn't help. I've gone to so many. Therapists. Psychologists. Psychotherapists. Psychiatrists.

All they have ever done is sit. Listen. Write on their clipboard and tell me they will see me next week. Even when I have specifically asked for them to tell me what's wrong with me, they don't. It took me 4 different people just to be properly diagnosed with GAD and I cried I was so happy. This same person told me to buy a book about CBT and just told me to keep reading it and it would help. I stopped seeing him because he wasn't giving me any advice anymore.

I have a lot more wrong with me and I'm struggling. I  have fetal alcohol syndrome and the older I get the more I think it affected my brain. Sometimes I just don't get along with.... people. I genuinely feel different. Like why can these people get along but when I try to I fail?

I've also endured a lot of pain in my life and I know that I don't handle it well. I get caught up in my emotions and I always regret the shit that I do later on.

Even when I have specifically asked for them to tell me what&amp;#39;s wrong with me, they don&amp;#39;t. It took me 4 different people just to be properly diagnosed with GAD and I cried I was so happy.

Pulling her by the hair and kicking with his feet and banging her head against the wall. But ofcourse family comes first. Saying i deserved it. And he wouldnt apologize. That seemed pretty forgettable as well. He says i caused stress and discomfort on the entire family. Nothing has been the same ever since. He tries to get information from me on the day of the incident about the people involved and who were those people but not on why i did what i did.

What i did was ""unforgivable"". My father looking at me staring dead in the eyes and saying i hate you tumse mujhe itni zada nafrat hai only when she is 22. Where he looks for reasons to hit her slaps her across her face. Anything from tying her hair to calling Eco instead of economics. Who really needs a reason anyway, right? You molest her but she is a slut and sadly she hasnt even had her first kiss. She comes home late from work and gets abused like she were being r**** mentally. The impact it leaves you is for life and will never be erased. While you are being abused because his day wouldn't end without it you just listen to him belittle you by calling you a whore and worse. No matter how hard you tried. Abuses you wouldn't give your worst enemy. Crying to sleep for months at a stretch with swollen eyes and soaked pillows making sure no one heard or youd be yelled for that too. Being to happy and joviel was a crime. Often shut down by words like don't act so smart. Staying a little longer each day at the bus stop to spend equally less time home. Sit in a park hopelessly so the yelling and abusing would reduce by a few more minutes. And this isnt even the worst of it. 

I have caused a lot of harm to these people by wanting to live my life. I have caused stress. 
He said dont meet those people you called the day you moved out. those people are a bad influence. Funnily i hadn't spoken to P*****i in ages and she still showed up. S**d is a father i never had.

,mentalhealth,"I'm from England and I have suffered through some experiences along with some mental health difficulties. about a year and a half ago I was discharged from a psychiatric hospital into a supported living flat in the community. Trouble was - my next door neighbour was very abusive. She kept this up for a long time; calling me and anpther service user 'retards'. She assaulted the other guy and she threatened to bring her three brothers into my house. She would wake me up in the middle of the night by throwing things at my window (I lived on the ground floor). I.E A football etc etc. I rang the police instead of taking it out on her as I had just had a situation with safeguarding with my mother (nothing horrible but I didn't want to complicate anything in anyway - understandably). The police were very poor at their job each time just telling me to ignore her insults and threats. At some point they did decide to try charge her with 'a public order offence with hateful intent' but the police rang me about 6 months later and told me they had left it too long so they couldn't do anything. I hate to say it but I often fantasise about dishing out some revenge. I don't want to go into it so much as it's unnecessarily inappropriate but I fantasise often about breaking into her house; beating up her boyfriend and her and torturing them both. I come up with meticulously detailed plans involving ways to hurt them both. I don't want to kill them but I'm so angry I want to do something. My nurse thinks I could have PTSD and this ordeal definetly wouldn't have helped with that. Not just the woman but I have much less of a respect for the police now. It affects much more than just how I feel but also how I think. I have a completely different perception of crime now in ways I can't explain. But I'm not too confident that it's for the better.

I think of ending my life but recently I've been more swayed by anger - leading me to prefer the option of ruining theirs more than mine.

Positive note: I'm not going to do this. I'm a good person but I feel very hurt. I want to work with my nurse and I'm on a waiting list for CBT. I'm also a big fan of the bible. I'm not very religious but I believe it holds much wisdom and I can learn from it. I do think that if there is a god. I can have the worst life imaginable - one that could possibly mirror hell itself. But I know that if I do the right thing and stay true to what is good and holy then it won't matter in the slightest for I will join Jesus Christ in heaven come judgement day.

I guess all I want right now is a little sympathy. I will be honest and hold my hands high if that sounds like attention-seeking behaviour. But in my defence I in fact crave that relativity to my peers; I want to know I'm not alone.

Final point: It saddens me to see bad things happen in this world. So can I please ask a favoir from my fellow redditors?:

,mentalhealth,"Before the story, I just want to state out some facts. 
1. Me and my friend has been friends for 10 years already. Since we're in early high school. 
2. I know about my friends depression because he told me that he had one. He has his meds as well. 
3. He also have Insomnia and he got meds for that as well. 
4. He once called me when I was at work, saying that he wants to kill someone, later kill himself because that certain someone made him pissed off. I cried instantly, begging him to not do that. He managed to  resolved that peacefully with that guy. Though with some damage to ahis neighbour's property. 


Ok so the story goes like this. I have a friend that is depressed. And easily get angry as well. So the story goes like this :

(Me and my friend loves to play video games together)
Last Thursday, my friend was expecting me to come over to his house and play some games and just hangout. But on that day, I got up pretty late as the day before I went to sleep at 6 in the morning. I woke up at a bit earlier before 2pm. He asked me what time I'll be coming at 1.45pm (I just woke up at this time) and I said to him that I'm still sleepy. And then after that he got a bit sad that I didn't come to his house on that day because I woke up later and he saw me playing game with another friend of mine on the night before, without inviting him to play together. I know he knows that I'm playing game without him because he could saw me online, and I didn't invite him. 

The next day, I asked him through whatsapp to come over to discord and have a chat(I'm sure everyone knows what this is), And he answered this : 
""I've been in a bad mood since yesterday, it's best if you don't talk to me for a while"" 
So I replied ""ok bro"" and did not message him anymore on that day. I thought that he is having a problem at home so I think its best for me to leave him alone. 

Moving forward to the next day (today), I greeted him and said ""Good evening sir"" ""Just checking up on you"". I didn't get a reply until it was 1.56 am, and he said why I used 'sir'. And he said that am I looking for a fight?  I said no, ""I'm not, boss"". I'm pretty sure that he snaps at that time, but he didn't say anything. I said I'm sorry if I have made him mad or anything. But he didn't reply afterwards. So I thought that everything was alright, and he didn't reply anything after that. 

Then my friend had snapped on me through whatsapp, where he messaged me at 4 in the morning, telling me that
""Not only are you stupid, insensitive, but you're fucking dense as fuck as well. No wonder your gf is often mad at you.""
(note that my gf and me always gets mad at me because I wake up late for quite some time). ""Please kill yourself"" is what he said to me later. Then I immediately apologise to him, and I said I don't want to get into a fight with him. I asked him, what I did wrong again. I asked him was it because I did not come to his house on last Thursday? He said partially. Then he said that me and his other friends are the same, saying everyone has forgotten him. I asked him again, what did I do wrong, because I don't know and I didn't want to Repeat doing it in the future. He said to me that to remember it myself. I really didn't know what I did wrong to him at that time. Later he said ""Do me a favour and cut yourself or something"" and I replied I don't want to. 

Then we got into quite an intense fight in the chat. He said that thanks to me and his other 'friends' that he got a headache till he cannot sleep. Then he said that I'm insensitive because I didn't think of his feelings on the day that I should go to his house because he was kinda excited for having me, but I didn't come to his house. He kept calling me insensitive a lot in his message.

He also got mad at me because when I play game, I did not invite him anymore. It's not like I don't want to invite him, but when he plays the game, even in a fun game mode, he gets super serious and when the game is not in our favor, he kept getting mad and it made the game not fun anymore with his rage. His rage made me felt very uncomfortable. 

Fast forward a few arguments later, I apologize to him, saying that I'm very sorry for what I did wrong, for all of my mistakes. But he relied with ""Go kill yourself"". I didn't know what I to reply, so I unconsciously typed ""Hm.."" and he said that ""what's that hm for you fkin insensitive piece of shit. This is a text chat, not a fkin role play chat""
""Seriously, fucking die""

That was the last of his message to me, at 5.10 am.


So that's the story. And I would really know on what to do, how should I reply to him, should I give him some time alone, or anything?

,mentalhealth,"The day started off fine . I went into town and met up with a close friend and had a great time.  I managed to hold my s*** together untill about half an hour ago when I went into a complete meltdown because of my total lack of self esteem and acceptance of my appearance.  Even though I know my parents likely feel more upset than I do , I just want to feel loved by someone or something and I feel like that's the main reason I get so upset because at the moment I feel like no one genuinely cares for me because they actually care about me if you get what I mean.  I have never been in a relationship and I just generally feel so out of league with anyone I've had an attraction towards in the past as I feel like if I see an attractive guy that they must instantly be looking at me and thinking ""Christ you're ugly"" because decent looking guys don't go for fat/chubby, ugly girls-i have a huge fear that I am never going to experience how it feels to be involved in a loving, accepting relationship as all I feel I have felt up to this point is that other people always want more from me than I can give them.

,mentalhealth,"So, I was recently confronted with hard truths. I had a great friend in my life that challenged me more than anyone else in my life to be a better version of myself. They called me out on most occasions for self-pity, self-sabotage, gaslighting, etc. I lost this friend the other day because I hurt them badly due to selfish, fear driven actions to be emotionally real. Most of the time I was completely unaware of what I was doing. I was insecure about believing them. I was insecure about myself and what they actually saw in me and how they felt about me. I had a lot of doubt in them and in myself, which caused much confusion for them.

I found that I have a fear of success. However, I have this fear I have narcissistic tendencies. Through years of being belittled, isolated, and viewed as awkward by peers, family, and those in authority over me I came to believe the lies others were telling me, I am not good enough. These lies are currently greatly ingrained in my truths to where I miss out and hurt others. So, instead of believing others I gaslit. Instead of believing I am good enough I live in self-pity, shame and doubt. I realized that I cannot go back in time and change the past, but to move forward and find healing for how I have hurt others. Also, to move forward in my own healing. I feel awful about what I’ve done.

Others thought they were the cause for how I treated them and my actions, but it wasn’t them it was me. I find myself disgusting for my actions. Now I fear this friend will never know the truth that it was me and not them. They’ve asked for space which, at first, I had a hard time respecting because I feared they would never return. So, instead of space I spent time inundating them with my thoughts, which was stupid and disrespectful and shows more sabotaging, selfish behavior. I have more respect for them to do that. I have done many stupid things. Now I have more fear because I am unsure they will ever comeback into my life. I want the best for them and currently that is not me. They were my best friend, the only person in my life, currently, who I believe cares enough to say something.

I feel lost and depressed. I have really worked on understanding myself, motivations, and intentions over the last few days. I’ve searched for the why and I’ve found some evidence, but awareness is not enough. I need to heal. I am NOT this person I have shown others, I don’t want to be this person. I don’t want to live in fear, fear torments and in my life I have tormented others. I start therapy next week to help me with healing and moving forward. I am hopeful that I will become a better version of myself. I am aware of who I have become and have a strong desire to be emotionally healthy, for myself and others.

Backstory: Admittedly I'm not the type of follow things to a T, my dad is a pastor of a youth group, and I'm in a leadership position in the group.


It started this morning, when he texted me saying we need to leave at 11:30. I had no idea what he was talking about, so I asked. Apparently during youth group he had said we are going to be playing touch football. This ended up leading to some back and forth that ended with him yelling at me and calling me lazy and a bunch of other things. I just ignored the messages and carried on.

About 5 minutes later and bursts into my room and starts yelling at me, and picks up my trash can, dumps my trash everywhere, and throws my trashcan leaving a dent, and tells me to ""pick this shit up"". I clean my room and decide to go to my study room to do some homework. He again bursts into the room and starts yelling at me saying if I don't pick up my study room ""there will be serious consequences"". I get to work on my study room when I hear him digging around in my bedroom. I go and see what he's doing, and he starts pointing out everything I missed, then yells at me for watching him leave.

I finish up what he asks, and it's peaceful for a few hours, when he again, bursts into my room. I'm just laying and reading, he shoves my bed and points out the trash underneath and says something along the lines of ""Do I need to tell you everything?"" He goes into my study room and starts throwing random shit around, I asks what he's doing and he says he's ""making the clutter more visible since I can't see it"". Be proceeds to grumble to himself saying I took advantage of him, because he was too soft. I turns and yells at me ""I'M PISSED"". His face is red, and I was afraid he might hit me. I just stay silent and move out of his way as he leaves. He just stands in the hallway, seemingly trying to stare me down, then just yells at me to get to work.

About another hour later, he comes into my room, saying he's going to the gym, and if he comes back and there hasn't been any serious effort made ""there will be consequences.

I'm afraid. Honestly, I don't know what's happened to him. I've been talking to my friends about him, and a couple say he was quieter than usual on Wednesday when we all saw him a lunch. As of now I'm just planning on A. Finishing everything up B. Leaving and spending the night at a friend's and C. Leaving the youth group.

So for almost 2 years I have been dealing with all kinds of sh*t; constant academic failure, emotional abuse (this has been a constant companion since my childhood), spiraling up in my own insecurities. All of this has just left me with  negative thoughts in my head and feeling alone all the time. I guess I have friends who'd care about me but I never really believe them (always been dealing with trust and abandonment issues). 



So in the later part of 2019 I decided to start with therapy and initially it went really well and I explained to them how I was expecting my results of the exam that I was constantly reappearing since 2 years and failing again and again.

 
2 days ago I got my results and I PASSED. 

I used to think that  probably my constant academic failure is creating problems for me and untill and unless I don't get out of this vicious cycle, I won't get any better. I always thought when I clear the exam I'd be so extremely thrilled and finally be happy after a long time of grief, anxiety and loneliness.

And yet here I am with the positive results and still don't feel a thing. I thought I'd be happier, life will change, things will start sorting out and yet I feel as if with every day passing, I'm drowning even further. I cannot seem to figure out what exactly it is.
 Maybe I need a better perspective?
Maybe I need better professional help? Or maybe I just need to stop overthinking.
I'm worried all consuming anxiety is gonna kick back again and it's gonna be all the same 2019 repeating itself. I'm not sure what I'm expecting 
I expected myself to be happy and yet here I am just lost and feel like curling up in bed all day and speak with noone forever. I have this constant feeling that maybe things got better but still something is lacking.

,mentalhealth,"I'm 20, my dad is almost 60. Over the past few years I have become much more aware of my dad's behaviour, I think just because I'm getting older. I actually think he might have OCD or Asperger's but I am nowhere near qualified to be giving anyone a diagnosis. I won't get into the reasons why I think that, but my mom (recently divorced from my father) and I have identified so many possible symptoms of Asperger's or OCD. I love my dad, and he does so much for my brother and I. 

The main problem is just that our relationship with him is so confrontational. There are a lot of good moments but almost daily there will be a huge argument or behaviour that is simply inappropriate. It hurts him more than it hurts me, because most of the time I'm able to maintain my composure and see most of what he is saying as irrational. I don't mean to sound so self-righteous, it's possible that I could be entirely wrong. Not only this, but my dad is extremely isolated and my brother and I are all he has. We will be moving out soon and then he will be totally alone. He has let almost every relationship in his life get away from him, or he has destroyed them by being so harsh and opinionated. I would really like him to see a therapist just to talk about all the emotions he has and how much he keeps inside due to being so socially isolated. 

I think I could get him to see a therapist if I told him I was simply concerned that he was sad and anxious and upset and it would mean a lot to me. But should I bring up some of the behaviours he engages in that I don't see as ""neurotypical""? Of course I have no idea if he actually has a social disorder or mental illness so I would never say that to him. He is almost 60 and I have no idea how it would feel to get a diagnosis for something he has probably had all his life. Or how it would feel for his own daughter to be the one to bring it up. Should I tell him I'm concerned about these patterns of behaviour? Would that hurt him more than it would help him?

I feel like I'm blind to my own thoughts and reasoning. I can't tell what going on inside my head.

I can't even tell who I used to be in the past or who I really am now. I don't know how long this has been a problem, I just know it's been like this for at least a few months. Maybe I've always been like this but only just noticed. But I think I've reached breaking point. I don't know what to do.

I just sat down in a dark room and tried to organise my thoughts but nothing came to me to be organised. It's like I do stuff but won't tell myself why I do them. When someone asks me why I do something I give an answer but don't believe it, it feels fake.

,mentalhealth,"So, I have never been diagnosed with any mental illness or disorder, but I have a history of mood disorders in my family. I’ve had a few bouts of depression in my life and I think I might be struggling with some disordered eating patterns, but this post isn’t about my mental health. It’s about my friends. At this point in my life I’m so very happy that I’ve found the best friends that I have, they support me, they love me for who I am, and I love them too. They are honestly one of the biggest joys that I have in my life and I couldn’t be more grateful to have them near me. However... there’s been a problem. I’ve always known my best friend, let’s call her MC, always had anxiety. She overthinks everything, everything always has to be a crisis all the time, and she gets panic attacks. It’s like, clinical anxiety that just hadn’t been diagnosed yet.  She and I became best friends over the course of a few years, and I love her to death and would do anything for her. I’ve even offered to let her move in with me because her “home” is too triggering for her. Recently, in the last year, we’ve met another girl. Lets call her GH. I didn’t know GH that well, and so when I started hanging out with her and the rest of our group, I was shocked and taken aback when she started having pretty violent panic attacks in front of all of us. While she’s recently started medication and therapy, it’s still pretty frequent and is accompanied by various mood swings, erratic behavior, etc. I really love her company and appreciate her as a human being, but things have just gotten so bad with my friends lately, I needed to vent about it. In November, GH and MC accidentally triggers panic attacks in each other. It was horrible, and literally the worst circumstances you could imagine. I found GH curled up in a ball, hiding from everyone and hyperventilating. I had to stay with her for a few hours as she kept spiraling into more states of panic, eventually ending up in her car, where she screamed and cried and violently expressed all of her inner thoughts and spiraling anxiety. I was all alone, and she was my ride. I couldn’t get out, there was no way to escape the absolute sword fight coming out of her mouth. I wanted to be there with her to help her, and I knew that it was best for someone to be there with her and that she needed it, but at the same time, it was just so scarring. I hated hearing her scream about how everyone hated her and how she just wants to die, etc. etc. she finally calmed down after about an hour of this. I’ve been nervous around her ever since, and I get uncomfortable when I’m in enclosed spaces with angry or upset people. I wanted to be there for my friend, but I couldn’t handle it. Now, as MC is dealing more and more with her anxiety issues and telling me about her panic attacks and triggers and begins to have spiraling thoughts in front of me I start getting so overwhelmed and I don’t want to be near her anymore. I know you’re supposed to be honest with your best friends, but how the hell am I supposed to tell my best friend in the whole world that her anxiety overwhelms me? She’ll internalize it and never want to open up to anyone ever again.

,mentalhealth,"My 38 year old sibling was diagnosed with LD, ADD, speech problems and allergies as a kid. My parents didn't like what Ritalin did to him, so they stopped giving it to him after 1 week. So growing up he did not take any medication. He has struggled in school, at home and work and with his weight. I believe he has an undiagnosed condition, but I don't know what type of doctor to go to for a diagnosis. 
He is morbidly obese.  He is under 5’8” and well over 320 pounds.  He is a compulsive eater, and will eat combinations of food other people simply wouldn’t think of, such as spaghetti with mayonnaise (an entire large jar of mayonnaise at that) or just plain hot dog buns.  All of this has led to a number of serious health problems, including sudden onset diabetes, which he was diagnosed with in December 2018, and severe sleep apnea.  These very serious health issues, which are dangerous and scary by themselves, are made much worse by his behavioral issues.  In fact, his diabetes diagnosis was only arrived at because there was a perfect storm of his poor health and behavioral problems.
He refuses to wear pants and prefers the cold, so during the winter he will go and sit on the porch in shorts and a tee shirt and watch videos on his phone regardless of the temperature.  He simply does not seem to feel the cold, and if he does he simply does not care.  This leads to dry skin (in addition to a chronic cough). When he gets dry skin, he picks at it compulsively which means his legs are always scabbed or bruised.  It seems like he can't tell when he has pain.  Last December, he picked at his leg and ultimately wound up with an infection.  He didn’t tell anyone about the infection until the skin was literally bubbling and oozing.  By the time he brought it to my attention (he hid it from our mom) he had a bubble the size of a golf ball by his ankle and was oozing puss to the point where there was a trail where he walked.  My sister and I insisted he go to the hospital, and when we got there he was immediately admitted (he stayed in a hospital bed for 10 days). 
While at the hospital they asked him his pain level on a scale of 1-10.  He calmly said it was a 2.  The Doctors did not believe that (so much so that they gave him Fentanyl).  After they administered the antibiotics via IV they ran blood work and diagnosed him with diabetes and informed him he was lucky to have his leg. 
Shortly after getting out of the hospital, he got an infection in his eye (cellulitis) and, after seeing an opthamologist  we were told to go straight to the ER.  He was then transferred to two different hospitals (via ambulance) because each hospital was so worried there would need to be an emergency surgery that could perhaps involve removing his eye. Once again when he was asked about his pain level he said it was a 2, and once again the doctor said he should've been in a lot more pain and administered Fetanyl. Ultimately he recovered, though the extent of the damage to his eye is still unknown.
Both times he told people that his leg or eye had looked the way it did for only a couple of days, which was impossible. His leg had been untreated for a month before anyone in the family was aware of it and rushed him to the hospital and his eye had been untreated for a week before we noticed it and rushed him to the hospital. After both of the incidents we decided to start going to his doctor appointments with him. At his appointments he said he was fine, nothing bothered him and answered questions with one word answers (the same way he responds to us). 
His health problems continue, and we once again had to take him to the hospital because of an open wound on his leg (roughly one year after he was first rushed to the ER with bubbling/oozing wounds).  They are simply made worse by his attitude/behavioral issues.  He lies to doctors, his family, and himself about his health. He is very stubborn and will do things out of spite. You can show him proof that he is wrong and he will simply deny it without offering any counterpoint. He will be sick and refuse to go to the doctor; if you ask him to do a chore he will leave and come back late at night so he doesn't have to do it; if you give him a date by which he needs to have a chore completed he will wait until an 11 PM of that date to start doing it (if he even does it all). If you talk to him about something he doesn't like (chores, doctors, weight, health, his eating, etc.) he will just ignore you and doesn't respond to you. When he is not working (he works as a cashier and is on his feet most of the day - despite doctor's orders that he limit the time spent on his feet until he loses weight) he just sits and watches tv (which, admittedly, he has done his whole life).
He also struggles socially.  While he is a very sweet and generous person he has struggled to find his place, and simply retreats into himself.  He goes to the movies by himself a few days a week. At any given time he has seen almost every movie in the theater (some of them twice). He has never had a girlfriend and has never had many friends. 
Additionally, he has “quirks” that may be indicative of something more serious. He has motor and vocal tics - blinks his eyes multiple times, twitches/shakes his head/neck, jerks his mouth/lips, and makes a spitting/hissing noise with his tongue against his teeth.  In addition to his compulsive eating, he seems to have other compulsions such as picking his skin until he bleeds, washing his hands with scalding hot water, checking and rechecking things (like closing doors), touching things.  If his clothes are in the dryer and you move them, he will wash them again. He also hoards and keeps things that most people would get rid of immediately.  He doesn't clean his room or car and refuses to allow anyone to. 
He also falls asleep when he is driving (he has been in many car accidents because of this). When he is not driving, he falls asleep every car ride within minutes. When he was left in charge of taking care of my parents cars that are in the garage, he would have to start them every few days so that the battery wouldn't die. He would start the cars in the closed garage and leave them running for a couple of hours nearly killing himself and me. When he was told he could not do that he got upset and just ignored me. The next time he did it he cracked the garage door, but did not realize it wasn’t opened above the exhaust pipe, and once again filled the garage and house with exhaust. I told him he could not do that, he had to open the garage fully and/ or take them out of the garage. He still refuses and I have to go out there and open the garage door. He has left the air compressor running all day nearly blowing up the house.  He refuses to help out around the house or follow any of the rules set for him (clean his room/bathroom). 
He has run up $20,000 credit card debt, 95% of it on food. He has no savings or any money. He lives pay-check to pay-check and everything else my mom takes care of. He lives with my mom. I do not believe he will ever be able to live on his own. We have tried antidepressants and nothing changed. Not too long ago I asked him about his future and he said he was going to get married and have kids one day. He is 38 and has never had a girlfriend or done anything that would lead to him one day getting married or having kids.  
Obviously, there are a lot of issues/problems.  I love my brother and want him to live the best life he possibly can, but when I look at everything that is going on and everything that has happened, I know that he will not be able to until he receives the proper care, which begins with a proper diagnosis. He does not think he has a problem, and would be heartbroken if he knew how apparent it is to those around him that he needs help.  Because he is 38 years old I am not able to direct his medical care.  I want to help my brother before it is too late, and know that he needs medical assistance but am unable to direct his medical care.

,mentalhealth,"Hey!

Im a male in my 20s from sweden diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. I have been in touch with psychiatrists  that says i need CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy i think?) but the queue to even get there is 6 months and i can't afford to go to a private psychiatrist.

I know my panic disorder and anxiety is based on me being scared of ""going crazy"" or ""insane"" and everything that makes me think about something irregular or weird triggers panic attacks and anxiety even tho i know very well that im ""fine"". Every time that i distract myself being with friends or having fun in general i feel great. But every time i feel great i also wonder like ""do i really feel great or am i going to feel bad soon?"" which of course makes me feel anxious and depressed.

The doctors i have talked to asked if i wanted anti-depressant but i already take medicine for epilepsia which have side-effects of their own and im scared anti-depressants will make me feel bad in another way.

I just want to throw myself out here in this subreddit and ask for some kind of guidance and to see if anyone understands what im going through. My friends and family are VERY supportive but nobody really understands how it feels. The only time im happy is when im somehow distract myself from this negative thinkingcurve. I eat pretty healthy and exercise regularly, should i just ""wait it out"" or ""power through""? 

I guess im just venting and looking for someone to guide me in the right direction, or any tips at all.

,mentalhealth,"im 23 y/o (f) and I’m sad, all the time. I haven’t been able to get a good nights sleep for the last month almost, I go to bed at 10 and lay awake until 3am.
I feel like I am at a constant battle with myself to pick myself up out of my little black ball of dark and twisty and whack on a smile for everyday life.

,mentalhealth,"Hi there folks, I was wondering if i could ask for some help. You see, i used to cut myself a lot when i was younger (around 11-16 years old) because i had depression and didn't know how to deal with it. I've been on a variety of different meds since i was 13, and those help. When i turned 16 i stopped, and when i turned 17 i started getting tattoos to fill the void that was left from cutting. I don't think im suicidal, i have not felt that low for a good wee while.

So that's a wee bit of background for you.

A few weeks ago, i got low again. I think it might have been just before xmas. But i didn't turn to cutting straight away, but i also didn't tell anyone. When i first went to do it, i just cried and didn't do it. But then 2 weeks ago i started. I'm cutting my upper leg, because then no one will know. I have my first appointment with a psychologist in a week, my first appointment since i was 15.

So my question is this, is it okay to feel the way that i do? Like, is it okay to want to do it and feel awful and good about it? 

I'm sorry for bringing this here, i just don't want to hurt my family again.

,mentalhealth,"My life hasn't been going the way I'd imagined for a year now. I am stuck in a country where I can't work, with someone who takes all of the money I try to save up to get a work visa or more recently, a phone, and spends it on beer or other unnecessary things. If we needed rent money, I'd get that. But that's not what's going on. 

Anyway, I'm at wits end lately and this morning is one more straw on my invisible camel's back and I can see the poor thing about to invert entirely where the hump used to be. ""If you don't clean this up I'm going to throw it away,"" is probably the worst thing you can say to someone that doesn't have much of anything anymore. I haven't been able to buy new socks or underwear for a year now, and when the animals that live in the same house as you have a knack for destroying all of your belongings because you haven't lived with dogs or cats in over ten years and don't know what they'll get into (the cats destroyed my discount bag of bread and ate the toppings off my pizza??? But left my wife's alone because she just eats cheese.. Its never been an issue in the past, probably because we never get toppings because it's expensive or I'd have put the pizza in the oven) and before you convinced the person you live with to crate their animals at night, they destroyed plenty of your clothes but hey.. Its your fault for not putting them elsewhere and you know it... 

But there's very few places the animals can't get to and if you try to use one of the spare rooms to protect your stuff, you get accused of trying to take it over for yourself.. I just. I can't believe someone would threaten to throw your shit away when they know you lost everything to be with them and when you barely have enough belongings to fill a BACKPACK, it hurts. All because you stupidly said that if they weren't going to clean up things that have been in the same messy pile for months into a bag and put away instead of stepping in cat puke because you didn't notice it in the pile of clothes you had to step on to get to something.

I am stuck in a country where I can&amp;#39;t work, with someone who takes all of the money I try to save up to get a work visa or more recently, a phone, and spends it on beer or other unnecessary things. If we needed rent money, I&amp;#39;d get that. But that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s going on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;m at wits end lately and this morning is one more straw on my invisible camel&amp;#39;s back and I can see the poor thing about to invert entirely where the hump used to be. &amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t clean this up I&amp;#39;m going to throw it away,&amp;quot; is probably the worst thing you can say to someone that doesn&amp;#39;t have much of anything anymore. I haven&amp;#39;t been able to buy new socks or underwear for a year now, and when the animals that live in the same house as you have a knack for destroying all of your belongings because you haven&amp;#39;t lived with dogs or cats in over ten years and don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;ll get into (the cats destroyed my discount bag of bread and ate the toppings off my pizza??? But left my wife&amp;#39;s alone because she just eats cheese.. Its never been an issue in the past, probably because we never get toppings because it&amp;#39;s expensive or I&amp;#39;d have put the pizza in the oven) and before you convinced the person you live with to crate their animals at night, they destroyed plenty of your clothes but hey.. Its your fault for not putting them elsewhere and you know it... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s very few places the animals can&amp;#39;t get to and if you try to use one of the spare rooms to protect your stuff, you get accused of trying to take it over for yourself.. I just. I can&amp;#39;t believe someone would threaten to throw your shit away when they know you lost everything to be with them and when you barely have enough belongings to fill a BACKPACK, it hurts. All because you stupidly said that if they weren&amp;#39;t going to clean up things that have been in the same messy pile for months into a bag and put away instead of stepping in cat puke because you didn&amp;#39;t notice it in the pile of clothes you had to step on to get to something. I dunno. I know I&amp;#39;m far from perfect, I&amp;#39;ve always been annoying, but now I&amp;#39;m self loathing and know I&amp;#39;ve ruined my life for a relationship that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be getting better. &lt;/p&gt;

i guess this is something rooted in attention issues, but thats not my whole concern. its also the extent to which i rely on this stuff emotionally. like, i often feel very bad anxiety and cant focus, and in those times the only way i  can think of to help is to rewatch some youtube video. i rarely engage in anything new because so much of my media consumption is based around comforting myself, so trying new things makes me feel anxious. i practically had an anxiety attack in the cinema the other day just because the film i was watching (rated suitable for all ages btw) was unfamiliar and made me nervous. i watched a new tv show recently and it also caused me to feel extremely anxious for the same reason..engaging in new characters and ideas is just so exhausting and anxiety inducing. plus, if i start relating or caring for a character a lot and something bad happens to them or they turn bad, it affects me a stupid amount emotionally and can make me feel awful. so i always just go back to the same safe stuff that i half listen to and gain nothing from. my family think i am strange and childish (fair enough).  im never trying anything new or trying to focus on whatever is causing me to feel bad, i just want comfort and distraction. even when i rely on rewatching stuff when im feeling anxious, it doesnt always help, but its all i feel able to do. 

plus, i also have a tendency to daydream a lot. its like, i have characters and narratives in my head, who ive had in my head since i was like, 8. i often cant focus on other media or tasks because im thinking about them. i dont know how unhealthy this is, i just know it seems kind of weird, and i dont know if i should be trying to detach myself from it, but that idea scares me. 

i also am kind of obsessed with one main piece of media and have been since i was 15, and a lot of my creativity and friendships especially online are based around it. i wonder if i take that to an unhealthy level too. 

should i be trying to detach myself from these habits? does anyone else do them? i know focusing on one thing properly is advised in cognitive behavioural therapy (or it as to me) and is viewed as a good thing, but sometimes when i try, it feels like ive left myself vulnerable to bad feelings by not filling my head with safe content as a buffer.

Over the Summer/Autumn, I (37M) tried to end my life twice as a result of a relationship breakdown and other issues I do not really want to go into too far; not the first time, hopefully the last though. As a result of one attempt, I have some marks/slight scarring on my left wrist. I am currently in the early stages of returning to work as a shop manager. The shop I work in requires that I often give close demonstrations of products to customers over a period of about 15 minutes, often to teenaged people. Currently I am able to wear longer sleeves so it's not an issue, however as weather warms up, I will be wearing shorter sleeves and, whilst I am fairly open with personal friends about what happened, I would rather not spend time answering the ""Hey what did you do to your arm?"" questions from customers or colleagues as I just get on with my life. 


I am wondering if anyone had any advice on ways I could cover this up. I tried a watch, but am not really a fan, preferring it on the other arm. I was thinking about using a bracelet or quantity of these to cover it but have NO fashion experience, or knowledge of what might work. Ideally I am looking for stuff that's not too masculine or feminine that would work, though I do not normally wear jewelry of any kind (other than glasses), so am a little out of my depth.

&lt;p&gt;I spoke about all of that with my therapist but she doesn&amp;#39;t seem to listen to me. For the record I am transgender and under HRT, she thinks a lot of what I am experimenting is because of my hormones levels and I know for sure it&amp;#39;s not only that. I&amp;#39;ve been 2 years under HRT and I am starting to understand how hormones works on me. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore, does anyone have some tips ? &lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"I (21, F) moved to uni a few years ago, and whilst I needed to get away from my hometown, the new place has just thrown up other issues that are slowly driving me insane.

I wasn't sure about coming to uni in the first place; I had no idea what I wanted to do afterwards, so had no indication of what course to do. I eventually picked English as it was my best subject. I hate it. The teaching is sub-par at best, and I have no motivation to either go in or complete the work. I had two hefty deadlines due last week that I had to have extended, and I still haven't worked on them. I open my laptop and stare for hours on end, usually crying periodically when my brain wakes up and realises what I'm doing (or not doing).

My dad can't afford to (/chooses not to) help out financially, and my student finance just keeps going down. My boyfriend has a chronic health condition and mental health issues that make it difficult for him to find work. We live together, and therefore a lot of the costs fall on me. I have no money to treat myself or go out whenever I want to, as we have to budget quite strictly in order to eat.

We live in a house shared with four other people, we have the loft space. The house is a lot for rent, and we don't get much for it. There always seems to be something going wrong and we're always contacting the landlord. Over the past few months, I have barely left the house, confining myself to my room, or my boyfriend's. I've had health issues that have knocked me down so much and my anxiety and depression seem to have increased tenfold. I've struggled with my eating for a few years now, and it keeps getting worse. All this has made me irritable and snappy towards my boyfriend. He does everything he can to make me feel loved and all I seem to be able to do is snap. I am trying to be better, but I hate how I've become. My mental health is not an excuse.

I have about 5 months of uni left, then I'm finally finished. But these five months just feel like they're going to be a continuation of the stagnation my life has become. I have finally figured out what I'd like to do after uni, and English is no part of it. I see no point in putting any effort into the degree any more, but I can't move forward with what I want to be doing until uni is finished.

I recently applied for a bunch of jobs in the city, stressed by the lack of money. But now I've had one rejection and a minute to think, I'm not sure I'd cope with a job alongside uni. It would totally override uni and make it even more impossible for me to get work done.

I just want to skip forward a few years, to living in a cosy little home we love, being financially stable once more, to being settled and happy with my boyfriend, a kid or two, and all the pets we keep talking about.

But I'm stuck. Stuck in this constant cycle of waking up, eating barely one meal a day, stressing about all the work I have no motivation to do, wanting to hide myself from my boyfriend because I don't want to make him miserable with my depression-fueled irritability. I have no idea what to do. I have no idea how to get through these next few months. I am at the end of my rope and I can't stand it.

I lost my mum when I was 4, and somehow I think if she was still around I'd be in a much better place.

If anyone has any advice on how to cope through the next few months til I can actually start my life, I would love to hear it.

,mentalhealth,"I am following a spiritual path as I have always been unhappy and was/am a binge eater and had various substance abuse problems.

I believe my father was emotionally unavailable and my mother was quite submissive, holding the peace in the family.

From my home life I developed a lot of worthlessness, self esteem issues etc (my dad basically passed these on).

Anyway...

I recently started really going into my self and trying to find out just what was making me tick, what am I, and the nature of my being.

I began finding out a lot. Negative traits here and there and also experienced a lot of blissful feelings, oneness and peace (for the first time ever).

With the work I've been doing I went straight to an event I know has been lurking in my mind for a long time.

The event was my first 'sexual' experience with my brother at around age 11-12. We would touch and jerk each others penises a bit, mostly with boxers on. Poke each other in the bum with boxers on and he also gave me oral sex with my boxers on.

My brother was 2 years older than me and this was entirely consensual from both sides.

The sexual bit was in apostrophes as it didn't really feel arousing. Overall it just felt like exploration and curiosity.

Lol so anyway that was an event that always lurked around and resurfaced from time to time but I thought I had already dealt with it.

Going even deeper into my self I found something worse which I had never really brought into my awareness before other than just kind of thinking of it as curiosity.

Around the same time or a year after, I was playing with my cousins (all were younger than me) as we normally would. For some reason I touched my cousin's clothed backside and sort of grabbed it.

I don't know why I did this. It seemed to come out of nowhere. I believe it was just curiosity. I never really thought about it again or did anything like it again.

20 years on this all resurfaces.

I don't want to make myself out like a victim but I have been going through pure hell working through all of this. So many layers of emotions coming and going. Suicidal thoughts have been pondering but I don't think I would actually act. I feel as though I do have hope as a human being. Albeit this is difficult to accept.

I am finally beginning to accept what I did but I just don't know where I stand.

I have only ever been attracted to females of a similar age to myself.

Do I tell my family? I don't think this is a good idea. It will cause unnecessary pain and confusion. Surely?

I don't think this has affected my cousin's life but still I abused my position of power essentially.

Looking at this from a shadow perspective; I have always done certain things that showed a complete lack of care for other people, albeit nothing like this, however things such as keeping quiet occasionally when things are to be paid for as a group, eating more than my fair share when sharing meals with people, completely ignoring people I go out with to talk to some stranger, pulling my good friend off a swing so he landed on his face. These might sound pale in comparison but there have been many more events like this.

If anyone can just give me their opinion it would really help. I am in complete turmoil. Dreams of drowning. Constant headaches. I am reaching out to therapists, forums just to have this out in the open. How do I actually integrate this experience into my character and move forward as a 'whole' person? It seems somewhat unforgivable. There must have been some form of attraction for me to grab my cousin's backside but really I see it as curiosity, and the shadow acting out. This has been deeply repressed and never faced seriously. I was working on my self so much, in an effort to help others in the future but now it feels as though there is no coming back. How can I help others if I can't be honest with myself and others? Ie, it feels as though I would need to explain this to people that want to know me well in the future.

Seems very tricky but I know it is still early days. I have been crying a lot and my body is in constant pain. Either way I am wanting to face this head on and figure everything out.

They really &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been shut down by now. This is the kind of facility one would expect to find in a movie - Not in Canadian society in 2020! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see if anyone else had any stories to share from youthdale (or perhaps similar facilities). 
I&amp;#39;ve met alot of children who had also been locked in youthdale in their childhood &amp;amp; all have equally horrifying stories and experiences too.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Hi all,

I'm a product manager based in San Francisco, and I've been supporting my partner as she struggles with depression and anxiety for several years now. In hopes of starting a new personal project, I've been looking for potential ways to help make mental health treatment more accessible. I would really appreciate your feedback on my ideas so far.

From my research, more than half of people with mental health illnesses are not getting help - even people who have health insurance.

There seem to be two major barriers that cause this:

1. There is a shortage of available and affordable care providers
   1. 51% of counties in the US have zero psychiatrists
   2. 40% of psychiatrists don’t take insurance
2. Getting insurance coverage very difficult
   1. Therapist directories are out often of date (those provided by insurance carriers)
   2. Mental health claims are rejected 2X more often as physical health claims
   3. The appeal process is too complicated for most patients to complete

I think there might be an opportunity to eliminate these barriers by providing an end-to-end online therapy solution, primarily based on video. That is, a marketplace for patients to quickly connect with their ideal therapist and book video-based therapy sessions that are covered by insurance.

1. Value proposition for patients:
   1. Faster access to therapists that match their requirements and are available due to a significantly wider selection, as patients are unconstrained by geographic location (statewide).
   2. More therapists accepting insurance since they will be provided tools to easily process insurance claims on their behalf

I am looking for any kind of feedback, tips, stories and opinions from anyone who's interested in the mental health space. It would be really helpful if you told me a little about your background (e.g. are you going to therapy, are you thinking of starting therapy, have you tried online therapy before...).

,mentalhealth,"I’m new to reddit and am not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this, so apologies if this isn’t the place for this. 

I recently got together with a group of friends from high school and, over drinks, the old days were the primary topic of discussion. I’m not sure if these guys have superhuman memories or if mine may be deficient. So many vividly recalled stories, many of which I had no recollection of(many of the stories involved me or were about something we’d done when we were young and wild). People were mentioned that I had no memory of. 
It’s not like I have no memories from that time, and there were lots of things that I did remember once they were mentioned. But it’s fair to say that I remembered much less than anyone else. 
One story in particular involved me stepping in to defend someone who was being bullied and standing up to an older, bigger kid after football practice and as the situation escalated I had to be restrained from getting into a fight. 
My friend is like, you don’t remember that??
I don’t. 
Seems like something that a person would remember right?

I’m now 40 years old and am a former college football player. I was never knocked unconscious while playing, but have learned in recent years that you don’t always lose consciousness when you are concussed. I played linebacker and there were many times when I’ve “had my bell rung” and have seen spots in my vision etc. My dad, who is now 71, played linebacker in the NFL for years and in the past year has been diagnosed with dementia and it’s likely that he has CTE. (He’s being evaluated by the NFL doctors and is part of the class-action suit against the NFL.)
Obviously this has heightened my awareness of memory lately. 

I’m not a person who spends a lot of time in the past, and I know that high school for many people is the best time of their life(not me. Not that it was bad.it was fine)and for this reason many of their best and most vivid memories are from this period. My friend with the most stories has a nearly photographic memory of those days, but I’m also pretty sure he’d say that was the best time of his life.  Meanwhile, I don’t really even remember my teachers from school save for a few(I would recognize them if I saw them) but I’m awful with names. 

I’m wondering if anyone can relate to this(how can you not remember that??)

Downvote, leave a nasty comment, I deserve worse. But please can somebody say anything? \n\nGoing to try and make this as short as I can but will likely fail\n\nI\'m 20\n\nWhen I was in middle school, I was having a really hard time.  I\'m transgender and I\'m now happily transitioning, three years on hormones and for once I enjoy the reflection staring back at me.  I was physically, emotionally and verbally abused by my father for 12 years until I finally cut him off.  During this period in middle school, my older sister was experimenting with basically any drug she could get her hand on (I didn\'t know this at the time).  She was my ride home from school, she was most days over an hour late.  I just stood there in the front for hours while everybody\'s family\'s picked them up and I called her and I called her and I called her.  Every day, late.\n\nWe got a dog when I was 2 or 3.  I don\'t remember a day without her (up until we put her down).  She was my best friend, my baby girl.  She was there for me every day.  She greeted me with a smile and a wagging tail, she slept with me.  She cuddled, she loved me.  \n\nI can\'t say whether this (situation I\'m about to explain) occured for a week, two weeks, or even a month.  At this point in my life, I was very disassociated.  Life didn\'t feel real to me, nothing felt real to me.  I didn\'t see myself growing up, I didn\'t see a happy ending for myself.  I was just angry, but I was the class clown.  I had to be a clown, I think it was a defense mechanism I developed early on.  Less tension when people are laughing.  I didn\'t know transgenderism existed.  I knew I didn\'t want to be a girl but I didn\'t know it was possible to transition, so about fifth grade I accepted it and I just tried to pretend the best I could.  As you can imagine, I was miserable.  Boobs were growing from my chest, I tried to wear make up, I tried to fit in.  The boys didn\'t view me the same as the other girls, because they knew I was a tomboy until fifth grade.  I shot airsoft and played video games, I just wasn\'t the pretty girl - I was just providing laughs.  I felt ostracized, I felt alone, I felt angry at the world, angry at god for what he (seemingly) did to me.  \n\nI would wake up, get in clothes that didn\'t feel right.  Brush long hair that didn\'t feel right, tried to crimp my hair when all the other girls started.  Nothing felt at home in my body.  I spent sox hours at school, filled with rage but with a smiling face.  Fake, I was being fake.  \n\nSo, here it is.  Where you may begin judging me, I deserve it.  I deserve worse\n\nMy baby girl, my dog - she started to have accidents while we were at school and mom was at work.  So we had to start crating her.  Then, she started doing it in her crate.  Even if I came home from a half day, three hours at school - she had done it.  It was poop and pee, and she would squish it into the crate all day, making it really hard to clean.  She would do it on the carpet if she was out, making it really hard to clean.  I knew she could hold it for way longer, I\'ve seen her do it.  I started to get angry at her, I yelled.  I know I hit her, smacked her at least open palm.  I know that for a fact, I maybe hit her closed fist on the but too but I don\'t remember for sure.\n\nMy entire life is very blurry, I don\'t have much memory beyond the last two or three years. I swear to God, I barely remember anything.  This was when I was 12 ish, give or take.  I was a girl, but I wasn\'t weak.  I caused my dog pain.  \n\nMy fits of rage would last only a few minutes.  And for years after I don\'t even remember recalling the situation.  We went on many years, we ended up putting her to sleep when I was 16.  If you were to calculate the amount of time I spent abusing her out of her life, itd be less than 1%.  But that doesn\'t matter, it doesn\'t matter.  I don\'t exactly remember when this all came back to me but it\'s been eating me alive for a few years now.  I\'m going to see a therapist ASAP, because I don\'t want to kill myself.  \n\nI write letters to her almost daily, and when I\'m alone I just talk to her in the sky.  I am so judgemental of animal abusers, and I\'m currently rescuing and taking care of a dozen strays.  \n\nI\'m a different person now, whether or not you want to acknowledge that I am a dude, I at least look like a dude.  I feel at home in my body but I don\'t feel home in my mind. Because whenever I crack a smile I think about how I don\'t deserve to smile.  I look at a picture of her and I sob, I\'m sobbing right now.  How could I cause her pain? Whether or not she could hold it in, whether or not she was intentionally making a mess, who fucking cares? I mean, what kind of monster raises their hand at a dog? Me, I was that kind of monster\n\nI really don\'t want to kill myself, I really don\'t.  I don\'t want to hurt my mom\'s feelings, that\'s pretty much the only reason - but it\'s a big reason.  I told her all about this. I told her about it, and she said that ""you were abused. I should have gotten a dog walker, and your sister was never on time to get you.  Your sister wouldn\'t clean up the mess even if she got home before you"" my mom tries to make excuses for me, but I almost want her to be mad at me.  I want somebody to be disappointed in me, I am so disappointed in me.  Matter of fact, that\'s a major understatement.  I mean I seriously consider taking my life because of this. But there\'s only me to blame.  \n\nI just can\'t stop thinking about it, I can\'t stop thinking about the pain I caused her - physically and emotionally.  How does somebody work past something like this?  I loved her with my whole heart, I still do and I always will.  Why wasn\'t I able to process what I was doing? Why did I do that? If I had the opportunity to go back in time a decade and do it all again, I would.  I would undo my transition, graduating, everything.  If I could get a chance to do it over I\'d happily clean up her poop.  I\'d clean it with a smile on my face if it meant I could hold her again.\n\nOkay, I can\'t stop crying.

,mentalhealth,"Like so many of us millennials, I’m going to use this platform to scream into the void as a poor method of emotional release. 

I just wanna start out by saying I have everything I ever wanted or desired. I got out of my hometown. I met the love of my life. I got a dream job. We got married. We travel. I get paid to do what I love. On the outside I should be happy all of the time, I should be content, I should be vibing. I should be THRIVING. Instead I’m stuck in this black nothingness. I swim in the black nothingness because I have to and because everyone tells me I have to, that things will be better when I make it out of the nothingness.

Why can’t you see the light? It’s so obvious that it’s there, at this point we don’t know what else to do to make you see the light. It’s like you aren’t even trying. 

The immense guilt I feel for seeing nothing but black is almost as bad as the nothingness itself. It is void of all light and color. It is cold. It whispers to you all of the time that you are nothing and will never be anything. That everyone secretly hates you. That everyone is unhappy because you are here. It starts to tell you to give up. 

Swimming in the dark like that for years and years and feeling so lost because you can’t see, it’s a miracle anyone makes it out. I always say that no things might not get better but they get EASIER.

Last year, the Anna Freud Centre launched www.onmymind.info, a free website to support young people aged up to 25 with their mental health and wellbeing.  On My Mind was co-produced with young people including those from the LGBTQI+ community.  This short, anonymous survey will help us develop On My Mind to more effectively support LGBTQ+ young people who may be struggling or worrying about their mental health or wellbeing.

Asking for some tips on resources but more so for how to encourage/convince an older immigrant Asian American to engage in mental and emotional therapy/counseling.

I won't go into the details or else a novel would spring up...but my near 70 year old mother has a lot of anger, bitterness and insecurities that are crippling her relationship with her family, namely her very elderly mother. It breaks my heart and frightens me when she gets into one of diatribes about all the wrongs she's experienced in her life and it was a hard life bringing up two kids as a single parent. Parts of the diatribes border on paranoia and it's why I feel like it's time for professional help rather than ""letting off steam"" as she claims. She's utterly convinced her elderly mother has looked down on her for a lifetime. And even into her 90's, is taking the effort make sure my mom feels awful about her life. It pains me to see my mom berate my grandmother. I have told my mother that even if it's all true, what do you want your 90 something year old mother to do at this point? Her time is very limited--let it go and work on yourself...

The problem is she is adamantly against any suggestion of therapy--having the notion that it's for ""crazy"" people.  According to her reasoning, she's not crazy just badly treated and bullied all her life. I try to couch therapy as a just a good chat to an understanding and sympathetic ear. Any experiences and tips to share on how I can steer her towards considering therapy? I know I can't make her go, but I can't just stand by either. I'm afraid that if she continues down this path unabated, I'm going to lose her into a void of angry paranoia.

Aside from the cultural antipathy towards mental/emotional health, there is of course the issue of finding therapy in her language and social zone. She's in Los Angeles and speaks Cantonese.  I listen and try to offer some help as I went through therapy on my own relationship with my mother.

While waiting for my next psychologist appointment, I’ve been doubting who I really am, and who I’ve always been prior.

I’ve been in denial, though, and I’ve been looking for any other possible explanation for what I could have. 

- Like I said, I don’t feel many emotions at all, and when I do they’re fleeting. I don’t show emotions on my face either, and so talking to me would be like taking to a mannequin who thinks he’s a person

- It sounds hurtful, but there hasn’t been a single person I’ve felt consistently connected to in my entire life, and I do want to get closer to people but can’t seem to be vulnerable. I distance myself from people I like, and I attributed this to depression, but I’m sure it’s got to do with my inability to feel love

- The only thing I guess I feel is frustration, due to my uselessness at emotional depth, and I’ve cried before because of that but not sadness

- Twitches on the right side of my face when I feel uncomfortable in someone’s presence/ when someone enters my personal space (it’s recent but could be signs of underlying contempt that I can’t recognise). Makes it hard to talk to people when it feels like I’m either smirking or looking at them with contempt 
This feels like more of a defensive thing, but has only recently been happening


I’m aware depression can cause numbness, but there isn’t a cause for it and I honestly don’t feel as sad as I should be given my isolation. Anxiety/stress can be causing my tension, but it’s the fact that I can fully operate and not outwardly show these feelings to people that concern me. In times were I felt stressed, no one around me could ever tell.

I know I have traits of autism, and it’d be a brilliant combination with this, but I do have cognitive empathy, just not affective, while in autism I know it’s the opposite. 
To be honest, I didn’t know the importance of eye contact in conversations until at most a year ago, but now that I’m aware, I can make it to the point of accidentally intimidating people (I tend to stare through people, predatory gaze)

I’m not schizoid, I don’t like conversations or being with people, but I did at one point, and I’d like to be able to bond with people if it’s possible. 

PTSD causes a blunt effect, and I had an event recently that borders on traumatic, but it wasn’t severe enough to cause PTSD, and I’ve felt this way even before it. 

And I don’t have NPD, I’m narcissistic (telling by my posts), but I don’t try manipulate people or seek “supply”, and it’s hard to be self aware with that disorder.

So that led me here, at psychopathy. Really thank you if you read all of this, but I just want someone to tell me there’s another way out. 
I don’t want to be a psychopath, I don’t think it’s a disorder worth being proud about, much like any honestly, and I’d rather be normal. But I’ve realised I’m not, and so I guess I’m looking for advice on what to do now.

,mentalhealth,"This is coming from the U.K. Apologies to those elsewhere if it doesn't translate to how your system works.

So, about 6 months ago I finally sought out help for my extreme anxiety (agoraphobia) and was put on beta-blockers by my GP. I asked her for therapy, explained I'd had untreated anxiety for 10+ years and I'd only just worked up the courage to seek help. I also told her that, if I didn't get help right away, I'd likely cancel further appointments b/c that's my cycle (I convince myself i'm ""fine"" days before appointments when the reality is i'm looking for an excuse not to go because even leaving the house is hard).

Anyway, she refused to refer me to a therapist because she said i didn't have a history to warrant it - I explained I didn't have the ""history"" to warrant it because I'd suffered in silence for 10 years, but she wasn't interested in that. 

In the UK, you can get free therapy if you're referred, and I couldn't afford to go private. Instead, she sent me to a ""social worker.""

Now, social workers are a weird one. I looked up the job description for them and it's *"" Social workers work with specific groups of clients, including children, the elderly and families in crisis, and help them to solve the problems they're facing. Generally, social workers specialise in either adult or child social care. Clients may be vulnerable or in difficult situations, so social workers need to be able to work under pressure and understand other people's viewpoints.""* Basically, they're therapist-lite, without the qualifications - I think?

Anyway, this guy was probably the most unsympathetic man I've ever met. He had a dismissive attitude and wouldn't let me open up about my past. He told me that people were ""moving away from talking about their past and focusing on the future"" in the mental health field, which, sounds like a load of bs to me. He then spent 3 sessions for 3 consecutive weeks telling me how much I was missing out on my life, as if I was going to turn around and be like ""holy shit you're right i better get over it, wtf was i thinking."" 

It was awful. By the third week, i was having panic attacks to and from the meetings.

So, for that third session, I decided to go all in. Since it was my first time seeking help, I thought the faults were on my end and that I needed to listen to him more, and maybe open up a lot more to get to the real issues. I had to go back for a repeat on my beta-blockers anyway (which didn't help me) but he snagged me from the waiting area before I could see my GP (i arrive everywhere about 45 minutes early. Idk why seeing as I'm so uncomfortable, but I'm always paranoid i'll miss something)

We sat down in his office and he asked me if i'd made any progress. I said no and he sighed. He told me he'd given me ""all the tools"" to get over it. He told me it couldn't be that bad and that i'm not a lost cause, and that I must not have been really trying.

I honestly thought I was either going to cry and lunge at him. I go into fight or flight when i go to the supermarket - so, when I feel threatened, it really does feel like life or death, even though, logically, I know it isn't.

""I was sexually assaulted when I was fifteen!"" I just blurted the words out. Idk why. It just came out. I'd never told someone face-to-face before (I've disclosed it to online friends, but that's it)

The guy shook his head and sighed an apathetic ""Oh okay then"" response at me. ""That must've been hard but you need to get over it. Now, lets get back to the point.""

Now, i'm no mental health expert, but I'm pretty sure the assualt I went through plays a part in why I'm so messed up today. I'm sure that speaking about it with an empathetic professional would help. I'm sure that even a stranger, let alone a ""social worker,"" would lend an ear if someone blurted that out.

I just burst into tears and left. The worst thing was I was so distraught I couldn't see my GP, missed my repeat for beta-blockers, and so humiliated I never went back. Now i have panic attacks thinking about it. It's taken me over an hour to write this post because i started shaking somewhere around the third paragraph.

I've finally worked up the courage to seek help again now and I'm about to sign on with a new GP. I'm actually thinking of writing a note to explain what I have and my experiences and just handing it to my GP on our first meeting, as maybe it was my lack of communicating well with my previous GP that had her thinking I wasn't as serious as I feel I am? I've also filed for my police reports from 10+ years ago, which will include a number of assaults I reported, hopefully with mentions of bruising etc as proof.

&lt;p&gt;So, about 6 months ago I finally sought out help for my extreme anxiety (agoraphobia) and was put on beta-blockers by my GP. I asked her for therapy, explained I&amp;#39;d had untreated anxiety for 10+ years and I&amp;#39;d only just worked up the courage to seek help. I also told her that, if I didn&amp;#39;t get help right away, I&amp;#39;d likely cancel further appointments b/c that&amp;#39;s my cycle (I convince myself i&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; days before appointments when the reality is i&amp;#39;m looking for an excuse not to go because even leaving the house is hard).&lt;/p&gt;

Insurance companies don't want to fully cover a car for me, so no financing a car. I can barely afford to anyways, I just know a car is important for work and what not. Owe $400 for a medical fee, and $400 for a student fee that I couldn't pay when it was due.

Girlfriend just broke up with me today. She's cheated on me, it's okay. I'm not sure why. She's said that I haven't changed since last October. I am not sure what she means, financially? Sure I guess but then again I let her take 3 weeks to pay me back for rent, so I guess that doesn't really help me when I get paid once a month. I don't really feel like she appreciates me anyways. Everyone knows this, my family, friends. I had a sexual history when I was young, like 13 years young. I'm okay and I have accepted that I shouldn't have. I wish I knew better and how it would've affected me.  She called me disgusting for having that past and so I feel like those feelings are what lead her to want to leave me. She's cleaning right now as I sit on the couch typing this up  I'm really not emotional and I don't want to get emotional  I don't know what to do. I don't know, honestly. I accepted her and her faults and decided she was worth sticking with, though she kept getting caught lying, and just hasn't been a really good person to me if I'm being fair to myself. I remember I had an appendectomy, and her face the whole time while I was getting drugged made me cry. I don't think about it but wow, that kinda sucks. 

Anyways, it's for the best but it's difficult to accept it. We live together, sharing a room so doesn't really help the situation, considering my financial situation, our lease isn't up until June.

I'm not sure what's going to happen. My father said he would help me get a new car but he has his own family and kids to worry about. He's also 8 states away. My mom is undependable due to her disabilities so not gonna help there. I have at least $800 that I have to pay SOON, but I never knew all of this would fall on me the way it has. I'm not sure what to do.

,mentalhealth,"Not sure if this is the sub I'm looking for, but I suppose it is.

I have noticed something about myself back in my teens. Although sometimes I'd find it a bit inconvenient (I hated that it gave me less credibility when speaking about certain subjects, if people who knew me for a little longer were around), I always thought it was just a teenager thing...and maybe it is. I'm 20 years old, so I haven't fully developed yet. Could be my answer.

The thing is, I am never ""myself."" I'm always going through some phase where I'm fascinated by something/someone, and I want to act within that realm...I *live* for every detail that can make me a believable character. I read about the subject and I become somewhat obsessed with becoming the character I've set out to be. I focus on even the slightest details, such as how I move my eyebrows and certain word choices, tone of voice, and so on.

I feel like I have no real personal values. I have lost certain values over time upon losing interest in one of my personas that I thought were real values I had developed. I feel like I have no real personality and am always developing a new personality that I'll use for several months, or maybe a year.

And even when I'm in serious situations, I am mostly worried about playing my character in a believable way. I want to be noticed for my ""personality"" by people through my subtle ways. I don't try to give verbal hints...I'm willing to behave a certain way for months so people finally pay attention to everything and notice that I ""am"" a certain type.

This is compulsive behavior. I get the urge to do this even with people I know won't buy my new persona, such as my mom. I don't try as hard, because I don't want to be seen as an imposter, but I still get the urge to act.

,mentalhealth,"I just can't take it. I want to curl up in a ball on the floor and scream for hours. I want to cry and rip myself to pieces to get rid of all the feelings I'm feeling. I just can't ever seem to get rid of them without using self harm as an punishment for thinking or feeling this way. 

I can always be better, so therefor I'll never be good enough. People are smarter than me, prettier than me, friendlier than me, happier than me. I can't be good enough beside them. I can never be good enough as I make mistakes, way too many of them. I just want to be perfect, a perfect daughter, a perfect student and maybe a girlfriend too. But I'm not good enough to be even a friend. I push everyone away by insults and being mean, as I can't let them close. If I let them close it'll be so easy for them to just turn on me, and see me hurting. I can't be hurting, I can't feel like this. I'm not being perfect by crying and complaining to internet strangers, I'm not being perfect for not getting such good scores in my tests or being calm, I'm too emotional to have my dream job or to get into the university with my scores. 

My body is a disgusting piece of fat, skin and bones, too tall and bulky. It combined with acne and personality and my ways of pushing everyone away leaves me alone. I have friends in school, I laugh with them and love to spend time with them. But nobody wants to see me. I'm so god damn lonely, and just hurting so much. I can't feel like this as it's not right, a perfect person wouldn't complain but I just have to get it out. There's literally nobody out there for me. My mother is a narcissist with always bigger problems, father just doesn't talk to me, and why would I ever tell my friends? They'd try get me a therapist by the school, I'd have to go and talk to them. But I know that person doesn't care about me, shy would they? They have no emotional connection and have never met me. Then my parents would get to know how I obsess over any single thing in my life to make it perfect and so they'd think there's something wrong with me. And I can't let that happen, I can't be a disappointment with mental health issues, I have to wait to move out before getting help even if then. I 

I can't let go of anything in my life. If I lose control the person who takes it will hurt me. They'll use the control to make me look weak, and I can't be that. I have to be perfect. And it's not possible, but that's what others want. Nobody will take anything less, nobody wants to see a shriveled mess. We want happy people around us. We want to see the happiness and also be happy. But I'm not happy. I'm so stressed and anxious I feel like I want to just crawl into the deepest part of the room and scream. I want to tell my parents that they fucked me up so bad and I wouldn't be like this, I wouldn't be hurting like this, I wouldn't be this. I would be better, I would be closer for being the best, to having my happiness. I wouldn't have memories with pain and tears for not being a good enough toddler. I want to show people that I can be friendly, I have feelings but it would hurt me, I'm always the though one. I can take anything. But I really can't, it hurts me so much. I don't want to even die anymore, I just want to get rid of this feeling, I can't do anything with it burning inside me. It makes me only see the worst and I can't be happy, I'll never be enough for it.

I want to curl up in a ball on the floor and scream for hours. I want to cry and rip myself to pieces to get rid of all the feelings I&amp;#39;m feeling. I just can&amp;#39;t ever seem to get rid of them without using self harm as an punishment for thinking or feeling this way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can always be better, so therefor I&amp;#39;ll never be good enough. People are smarter than me, prettier than me, friendlier than me, happier than me. I can&amp;#39;t be good enough beside them. I can never be good enough as I make mistakes, way too many of them. I just want to be perfect, a perfect daughter, a perfect student and maybe a girlfriend too. But I&amp;#39;m not good enough to be even a friend. I push everyone away by insults and being mean, as I can&amp;#39;t let them close. If I let them close it&amp;#39;ll be so easy for them to just turn on me, and see me hurting. I can&amp;#39;t be hurting, I can&amp;#39;t feel like this. I&amp;#39;m not being perfect by crying and complaining to internet strangers, I&amp;#39;m not being perfect for not getting such good scores in my tests or being calm, I&amp;#39;m too emotional to have my dream job or to get into the university with my scores. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My body is a disgusting piece of fat, skin and bones, too tall and bulky. It combined with acne and personality and my ways of pushing everyone away leaves me alone. I have friends in school, I laugh with them and love to spend time with them. But nobody wants to see me. I&amp;#39;m so god damn lonely, and just hurting so much. I can&amp;#39;t feel like this as it&amp;#39;s not right, a perfect person wouldn&amp;#39;t complain but I just have to get it out. There&amp;#39;s literally nobody out there for me. My mother is a narcissist with always bigger problems, father just doesn&amp;#39;t talk to me, and why would I ever tell my friends? They&amp;#39;d try get me a therapist by the school, I&amp;#39;d have to go and talk to them. But I know that person doesn&amp;#39;t care about me, shy would they? They have no emotional connection and have never met me. Then my parents would get to know how I obsess over any single thing in my life to make it perfect and so they&amp;#39;d think there&amp;#39;s something wrong with me. And I can&amp;#39;t let that happen, I can&amp;#39;t be a disappointment with mental health issues, I have to wait to move out before getting help even if then. I &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t let go of anything in my life. If I lose control the person who takes it will hurt me. They&amp;#39;ll use the control to make me look weak, and I can&amp;#39;t be that. I have to be perfect. And it&amp;#39;s not possible, but that&amp;#39;s what others want. Nobody will take anything less, nobody wants to see a shriveled mess. We want happy people around us. We want to see the happiness and also be happy. But I&amp;#39;m not happy. I&amp;#39;m so stressed and anxious I feel like I want to just crawl into the deepest part of the room and scream. I want to tell my parents that they fucked me up so bad and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be like this, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be hurting like this, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be this. I would be better, I would be closer for being the best, to having my happiness. I wouldn&amp;#39;t have memories with pain and tears for not being a good enough toddler. I want to show people that I can be friendly, I have feelings but it would hurt me, I&amp;#39;m always the though one. I can take anything. But I really can&amp;#39;t, it hurts me so much. I don&amp;#39;t want to even die anymore, I just want to get rid of this feeling, I can&amp;#39;t do anything with it burning inside me. It makes me only see the worst and I can&amp;#39;t be happy, I&amp;#39;ll never be enough for it.

,mentalhealth,"I use to try so hard, maybe even too hard. I use to have so much hope even when things weren't going so well. My life feels cursed as if I'm supposed to be stuck in a mediocre life or worse, some strange kind of hell. 

I recently got laid off, because the company I'm working for moved to another state after not being able to find the correct person they needed to higher (or though they say). Right now I'm in a limbo of not knowing where to go or what to do. I have some ideas of a couple of things I want to do, but since so many things in my life ended in disappointment, I don't have all the hope I wish I had. I feel like a butterfly that had its wings torn off, no longer able to fly.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember, back in High School, which was over a decade ago, I was so hopeful for the future. Things weren't perfect at the time, but I was very hopeful. I always knew I was different, I didn't do very well in a school other than some select classes, which were usually classes I shared the most interest in and they usually were related with performing arts and theater. Other classes, I could focus on, no matter how much I tried. I also had a very difficult time comprehending what was being taught or what I was supposed to learn. Things just didn't make sense to me. Also, my social cues are off and I've always have had a hard time making friends or even keeping friends. I have recently discovered and realized (even though still undiagnosed) that I have Aspergers, which helped me make a little more sense of my world. When I was a child, my mom knew something was up, so she had me checked by professionals, they had the idea that I was on the autistic spectrum, but in the end, they left it at ""unknown"" because they couldn't figure it out. This was early-mid 90s, so maybe they didn't have everything they needed to give me an actual diagnosis? I don't know what happened there, I wish they could have diagnosed me with Aspergers back then, that would have helped a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

 Anyways, after I finished High School, I didn't continue schooling right away. Instead, I wasted a couple of years doing something for a religion I was brainwashed into, luckily I'm no longer in that cult, but it certainly had a big turn in my life and affected me in many ways, still leaving an imprint that is hardwired to my brain to this day even though I left 8 years ago. I left this cult about a year and a half after I was I finished this particular trip I went on after I finished High School. The time I left my religion was also the same time I started school again. I went to college to pursue my interest in performing arts and theater. The school was expensive, and even though I didn't do well in all of my classes, I did very well in others when it came to things that I was actually pursuing. This was a very good time of my life, unfortunately, it didn't last. My step-father at the time, who's schizophrenic and was very involved with the religion I use to be in had some very strange ideas about me that he thought were real. It was so bad that he even believed that I was having a sexual relationship with my mother (I'm disgusted just thinking about it). He belied my mother and I would sneak out at night while he was sleeping to have sex (thinking about his believes even today makes me want to barf). Anyways, this made him very jealous and I had to move out. (My mother eventually divorced him a few years after this, which I'm glad because he was also emotionally abusive). I was working part-time at a fast-food joint and was only making a quarter more than the federal minimum wage. I had to be on food stamps so that I could afford the rent for the room I was renting at the time. I was unable to keep my car because that was out of my budget. No car meant that I didn't have transportation to go to school. The area I lived at had very good public transportation... except the location of my school, so I couldn't even take public transportation to get there. So I did what I had to do, I dropped out. I dropped out and then went to a local community college instead. 

I changed my plans a little bit, decided to do generals and receiving an associate's degree there so that I can go to the local university instead because public transportation was very accessible to both the community college and the local university.  While I was going to the community college, I was of course still working at that fast food joint so that I could continue paying rent. I didn't have any other financial support other than student loans, which wasn't enough to pay for my rent, not to mention food, so I had to keep my job to continue to support me. Plus, I needed to have a job if I wanted to continue receiving food stamps. I wish I didn't have to keep my job so that I could fully focus on school, which would have been key to my disability. If I didn't have to work, I could have used that time to focus on my school more, which could have helped me pass a couple of my classes that I ended up failing which caused other issues a little later down the road. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the semester ended, I registered for my new classes. Things at work weren't going so well, I worked there for a couple of years, never got a raise, I was pulling teeth to get a raise, which was unpromised. I was very loyal to my work but the general manager under-appreciated me, she even screwed me over, she would cut my hours and even illegally removed some over-time I had because she was more concerned about her bonuses than what was rightfully mine. I even have my suspicions that she clocked me out early before by an hour or two, making me unknowingly work for free and off the clock, this woman stole time from me. Eventually, she moved to another state and we got a new general manager, this was the guy I was pulling teeth with to try and get a raise. But, instead, I found another job that almost paid double of what I was making an hour. The job was full time, which did cause some issues for my school schedule, so I decided to do part-time school the time being and just changed my schedule for the upcoming semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Around that same time, my mother separated from her husband and moved to an apartment. She couldn't financially afford this by herself, so I moved in with her to the new apartment as well as one of my sisters in a two-bedroom apartment. My mom and my sister shared the master bedroom and I had the other room to myself. School started again, which I went to class after work by taking public transportation. On the first day of class, after class, I took the bus home. While I was at the bus stop, this foreign girl that was in my class was also waiting for the same bus. So I started to talk to her. I was a very lonely guy, never really had a longterm relationship before, lol, I was even a virgin at the time. The last relationship I was in before that only lasted about a month, which I had that relationship while I was still in that religion shortly after I got back from that particular trip. So I start talking more to this girl from class. We became friends, but I wanted more than friendship. I really liked her, but she had a boyfriend I come to find out in her home country. We were still hanging out and such and even though I knew she had a boyfriend, I decided to take my chances and asked her to be my girlfriend. She said no.

&amp;#x200B;

She still wanted to hang out with me and remain friends after that, but I had to explain that I had feelings for her and would have a hard time just staying friends. But even after I explained that we still hung out anyways and stayed friends, at least for a little while. As we hung out more, I got closer to each other, I had a strong feeling that we would soon be a couple. One day we were hanging out at her apartment. I was about to leave, but she wanted me to stay. So I did as she begged. She didn't have a couch or anything to sleep on, so she had me sleep on her bed that night. We didn't have sex or anything. She fell asleep and I couldn't fall asleep. I just laid there and kept my hands to myself, except for one time when she almost fell off the bed why she was sleeping, I pulled her back up so that she wouldn't fall on the floor. But I was wide awake the entire time. I tried to sleep, but just couldn't. This was my first time laying in bed with another girl. The next morning, she woke up. I not sure what happened, but she looks at me and then starts kissing me. I kiss her back, we are then we completely start making out and holding each other, I felt like my dream has come true. After that, she broke up with her boyfriend in her home country to be with me and then we were a couple. 

We finished that semester being together. My schooling went ok. At the end of the semester, my girlfriend and I had moved in together. I think I took the following semester off and didn't take any classes, though I can't remember exactly why. My girlfriend, of course, continued taking classes and I think I just worked. Later on, my job decided to lay off some employees because it was too slow. So I was unemployed, I got laid off towards the end of the semester and the new semester was about to start. Since I was unemployed, I thought it would be good to take classes for the following semester. Unfortunately, since my grades didn't meet standards, I was unable to get student loans, so I would have to pay out of pocket. I decided, since I needed to get a new job anyway, so stick with part-time, and took two evening classes, one of those classes my girlfriend and I had together. I found a new job and was able to work and go to class, but I had to pay rent and the place we were living in was expensive, so I couldn't afford to pay for my classes. Eventually, we moved to a new place that wasn't so expensive. My girlfriend has always begged me to get a car because we were always walking and taking public transportation everywhere and she grew tired of that. After being pressured to get a car for a while, I eventually gave in and got a car. It wasn't easy to get a car, because my credit score wasn't all that great. I couldn't continue school, because my tuition was still unpaid for, I was unable to register for school. So I continued working full time. I found a new and better full-time job and left the one I had for this new job. I worked at this new job for a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend ever since for the most part. But she is abusive, mostly emotionally and verbally but also sometimes physically. I've left her a couple of times, but she promised in the past that she changed and my stupid self would get back with her. But she hasn't changed. She wasn't abusive right away, I don't think signs of her abusiveness didn't actually show up until we were together for at least half a year. She's also got mood swings, where at one point everything seems fine and then out of the blue she just starts yelling at me for who knows what. Sometimes I'm just minding my own business and then she starts arguing with me. When people yell at me, I get really quiet and I don't say anything until it stops. With her, it doesn't really stop, and because I get quiet, I'm not giving her the attention she wants. She hates being ignored and will sometimes start hitting me to get my attention. Sometimes when she pushes me that way and the pressure builds up, I lose it and then I'm furiously screaming at her out of stress, sometimes gesturing aggressiveness even though I'm not hitting her, I'm sometimes throwing something to the other side of the room. Which scares her when I'm acting like that and that makes her angrier and then she may even hit me because of it. Things are out of control, my mind always tries to tell me to calm down and just leave, but for some reason, I can't and I'm still freaking out. Yelling at her and telling her not to hit me.

&amp;#x200B;

She's always calling me lazy, saying I don't do enough. In a way she's right. I haven't done much at all with performing arts or theater at all recently, even though I've been really wanting to. But I think my depression and my anxiety got the better part of me. Not doing what I've been wanting to do, but also struggling with money and financially, I tried getting into entrepreneurship and start my own online business. But that hadn't been easy. I tried selling stuff on Amazon using Fulfillment by Amazon, but I was actually spending more than what I was making and I wasn't selling much even though I advertised, so I ended up having Amazon send me back all my stuff. Later on, I tried again, but this time not with Amazon, I discovered Dropshipping, studied and learned a lot about that and opened my own store on Shopify. I wasn't selling on there either, even after following some strategies I found online and having a Shopify store that was opened for half a year I only made one sale even with advertising, so I gave up. Sometimes it feels like there's someone or something keeping me from being successful. Purposely stopping me from becoming successful and financially secure. But even though I'm sure that's all in my head, it almost feels real, like the big guys, maybe part of Google, Amazon (fyi, I'm not actually blaming companies like Google or Amazon, just a funny idea in my head) or some big corporation or maybe even the Illuminati or something making sure the little guys like me make sure that I stay down and never progress. But again, I'm more convinced that this isn't reality and just my imagination. But it indeed feels like I'm stuck in the low life mediocre life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently going through a lot of depression, stuck in this limbo of this strange hell. I don't know what to do. Sometimes I wish I was never born and have never existed at all. My girlfriend yelled at me earlier today, making me feel worthless. She's always talking about business and how great capitalism is and how I need to study more and read more books and all kinds of nonsense. It's so boring when she talks because when she's not yelling at me, that's 99% of her conversation. I'm not even allowed to have other conversations much for the things I'm interested in. Then, of course, she gets mad at me when I show boredom. I don't know what to do anymore. Since I'm unemployed, I've been delivering food using food delivery apps. And then she yells at me telling me I'm not doing enough of that and that I should deliver more so that I can afford rent. I feel lucky that she might be moving back to her home country soon because that would end this relationship by default. I don't understand why it's so hard to leave, especially a toxic and unhealthy relationship. I guess I'm afraid to feel alone because getting into a relationship is a serious and complicated task for me because I don't have the that great social skills, I'm actually very awkward to be around with, which is the reason why I even have a hard time making friends. I'm the kind of person that doesn't know what to say or how to say the things that I want to say. I'm also not all the attractive, nor in good shape and not all that healthy, so getting into another relationship almost feels impossible. But this one is toxic, so I understand that I really need to get out of this one.

As far as finding a new job, that hasn't been easy. I'm not all that great at interviews, which I think is normal for most and I know I can land a job because I've done it before. But at the same time, I'm tired of working  9 to 5 jobs, just barely making enough on slave wage. Which is the reason I tried starting a couple of business, I'm just tired of this. I hate having to work to live and that I have live to work, what is that all about. I feel like life should be so much more than just work, eat, sleep, repeat and it's causing me to be more and more depressed. I can't handle it anymore. I don't want to live like this, I hate this. I've tried so hard and I kept trying again and again and again. Always trying to find ways to find new strategies and try again but then keep watching myself fail over and over and over again that my hope that I use to have so much is hanging on by a thread. I'm only 30, but my health isn't all the great and I feel like I might die by heart attack anytime soon, which scares me, but at the same time, I'd rather be dead. I think I'm starting to become suicidal because I don't know what to do anymore. I need help, but I can't afford help. I'm in serious debt and lately, I've been getting lawsuit after lawsuit from creditors from unpaid debt from years ago because I couldn't afford to pay for this or that, which is just adding more and more on my shoulders. I don't know what to do anymore. I stay up late watching Youtube and playing video games until late to get away from the world and then sleep past noon. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as good things that are happening, I'm seeing a talent agent next week because I really want to pursue theater and performing arts and thought I should really do something about it, but at the same time, I'm filled with anxiety. Because of my personality, because of my lack of social skills, I have this anxiety that I will be turned down. So I'm really hanging on to that hope that's hanging on by a thread, hoping that this will work out, that I will pursue my dreams. But overall, I really need help in life and I just don't know where to turn.

If you've gotten this far, I really want to thank you for sticking with my story this far. I know that was a lot. I'm really hoping somebody, anybody will really analyze everything I have written. Someone that can really look into this and provide me with the help I need as far as my mental health goes at the least. There's so much more in my story that I haven't mention, something much more severe that I went through not to long ago, perhaps that'll be another post for another time because that was a very scary time of my life. But I hope that I can find what I need here in this subreddit.",t2_5gvd6kvc,False,,0,False,Why isn't life working???,[],r/mentalhealth,False,,,0,,False,t3_eq9lp8,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1579338392.0,text,,,,text,self.mentalhealth,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use to try so hard, maybe even too hard.

I didn&amp;#39;t have any other financial support other than student loans, which wasn&amp;#39;t enough to pay for my rent, not to mention food, so I had to keep my job to continue to support me. Plus, I needed to have a job if I wanted to continue receiving food stamps. I wish I didn&amp;#39;t have to keep my job so that I could fully focus on school, which would have been key to my disability. If I didn&amp;#39;t have to work, I could have used that time to focus on my school more, which could have helped me pass a couple of my classes that I ended up failing which caused other issues a little later down the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the semester ended, I registered for my new classes. Things at work weren&amp;#39;t going so well, I worked there for a couple of years, never got a raise, I was pulling teeth to get a raise, which was unpromised. I was very loyal to my work but the general manager under-appreciated me, she even screwed me over, she would cut my hours and even illegally removed some over-time I had because she was more concerned about her bonuses than what was rightfully mine. I even have my suspicions that she clocked me out early before by an hour or two, making me unknowingly work for free and off the clock, this woman stole time from me. Eventually, she moved to another state and we got a new general manager, this was the guy I was pulling teeth with to try and get a raise. But, instead, I found another job that almost paid double of what I was making an hour. The job was full time, which did cause some issues for my school schedule, so I decided to do part-time school the time being and just changed my schedule for the upcoming semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around that same time, my mother separated from her husband and moved to an apartment. She couldn&amp;#39;t financially afford this by herself, so I moved in with her to the new apartment as well as one of my sisters in a two-bedroom apartment. My mom and my sister shared the master bedroom and I had the other room to myself. School started again, which I went to class after work by taking public transportation. On the first day of class, after class, I took the bus home. While I was at the bus stop, this foreign girl that was in my class was also waiting for the same bus. So I started to talk to her. I was a very lonely guy, never really had a longterm relationship before, lol, I was even a virgin at the time. The last relationship I was in before that only lasted about a month, which I had that relationship while I was still in that religion shortly after I got back from that particular trip. So I start talking more to this girl from class. We became friends, but I wanted more than friendship. I really liked her, but she had a boyfriend I come to find out in her home country. We were still hanging out and such and even though I knew she had a boyfriend, I decided to take my chances and asked her to be my girlfriend. She said no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She still wanted to hang out with me and remain friends after that, but I had to explain that I had feelings for her and would have a hard time just staying friends. But even after I explained that we still hung out anyways and stayed friends, at least for a little while. As we hung out more, I got closer to each other, I had a strong feeling that we would soon be a couple. One day we were hanging out at her apartment. I was about to leave, but she wanted me to stay. So I did as she begged. She didn&amp;#39;t have a couch or anything to sleep on, so she had me sleep on her bed that night. We didn&amp;#39;t have sex or anything. She fell asleep and I couldn&amp;#39;t fall asleep. I just laid there and kept my hands to myself, except for one time when she almost fell off the bed why she was sleeping, I pulled her back up so that she wouldn&amp;#39;t fall on the floor. But I was wide awake the entire time. I tried to sleep, but just couldn&amp;#39;t. This was my first time laying in bed with another girl. The next morning, she woke up. I not sure what happened, but she looks at me and then starts kissing me. I kiss her back, we are then we completely start making out and holding each other, I felt like my dream has come true. After that, she broke up with her boyfriend in her home country to be with me and then we were a couple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished that semester being together. My schooling went ok. At the end of the semester, my girlfriend and I had moved in together. I think I took the following semester off and didn&amp;#39;t take any classes, though I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly why. My girlfriend, of course, continued taking classes and I think I just worked. Later on, my job decided to lay off some employees because it was too slow. So I was unemployed, I got laid off towards the end of the semester and the new semester was about to start. Since I was unemployed, I thought it would be good to take classes for the following semester. Unfortunately, since my grades didn&amp;#39;t meet standards, I was unable to get student loans, so I would have to pay out of pocket. I decided, since I needed to get a new job anyway, so stick with part-time, and took two evening classes, one of those classes my girlfriend and I had together. I found a new job and was able to work and go to class, but I had to pay rent and the place we were living in was expensive, so I couldn&amp;#39;t afford to pay for my classes. Eventually, we moved to a new place that wasn&amp;#39;t so expensive. My girlfriend has always begged me to get a car because we were always walking and taking public transportation everywhere and she grew tired of that. After being pressured to get a car for a while, I eventually gave in and got a car. It wasn&amp;#39;t easy to get a car, because my credit score wasn&amp;#39;t all that great. I couldn&amp;#39;t continue school, because my tuition was still unpaid for, I was unable to register for school. So I continued working full time. I found a new and better full-time job and left the one I had for this new job. I worked at this new job for a few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been with my girlfriend ever since for the most part. But she is abusive, mostly emotionally and verbally but also sometimes physically. I&amp;#39;ve left her a couple of times, but she promised in the past that she changed and my stupid self would get back with her. But she hasn&amp;#39;t changed. She wasn&amp;#39;t abusive right away, I don&amp;#39;t think signs of her abusiveness didn&amp;#39;t actually show up until we were together for at least half a year. She&amp;#39;s also got mood swings, where at one point everything seems fine and then out of the blue she just starts yelling at me for who knows what. Sometimes I&amp;#39;m just minding my own business and then she starts arguing with me. When people yell at me, I get really quiet and I don&amp;#39;t say anything until it stops. With her, it doesn&amp;#39;t really stop, and because I get quiet, I&amp;#39;m not giving her the attention she wants. She hates being ignored and will sometimes start hitting me to get my attention. Sometimes when she pushes me that way and the pressure builds up, I lose it and then I&amp;#39;m furiously screaming at her out of stress, sometimes gesturing aggressiveness even though I&amp;#39;m not hitting her, I&amp;#39;m sometimes throwing something to the other side of the room. Which scares her when I&amp;#39;m acting like that and that makes her angrier and then she may even hit me because of it. Things are out of control, my mind always tries to tell me to calm down and just leave, but for some reason, I can&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;m still freaking out. Yelling at her and telling her not to hit me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s always calling me lazy, saying I don&amp;#39;t do enough. In a way she&amp;#39;s right. I haven&amp;#39;t done much at all with performing arts or theater at all recently, even though I&amp;#39;ve been really wanting to. But I think my depression and my anxiety got the better part of me. Not doing what I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to do, but also struggling with money and financially, I tried getting into entrepreneurship and start my own online business. But that hadn&amp;#39;t been easy. I tried selling stuff on Amazon using Fulfillment by Amazon, but I was actually spending more than what I was making and I wasn&amp;#39;t selling much even though I advertised, so I ended up having Amazon send me back all my stuff. Later on, I tried again, but this time not with Amazon, I discovered Dropshipping, studied and learned a lot about that and opened my own store on Shopify. I wasn&amp;#39;t selling on there either, even after following some strategies I found online and having a Shopify store that was opened for half a year I only made one sale even with advertising, so I gave up. Sometimes it feels like there&amp;#39;s someone or something keeping me from being successful. Purposely stopping me from becoming successful and financially secure. But even though I&amp;#39;m sure that&amp;#39;s all in my head, it almost feels real, like the big guys, maybe part of Google, Amazon (fyi, I&amp;#39;m not actually blaming companies like Google or Amazon, just a funny idea in my head) or some big corporation or maybe even the Illuminati or something making sure the little guys like me make sure that I stay down and never progress. But again, I&amp;#39;m more convinced that this isn&amp;#39;t reality and just my imagination. But it indeed feels like I&amp;#39;m stuck in the low life mediocre life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently going through a lot of depression, stuck in this limbo of this strange hell. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Sometimes I wish I was never born and have never existed at all. My girlfriend yelled at me earlier today, making me feel worthless. She&amp;#39;s always talking about business and how great capitalism is and how I need to study more and read more books and all kinds of nonsense. It&amp;#39;s so boring when she talks because when she&amp;#39;s not yelling at me, that&amp;#39;s 99% of her conversation. I&amp;#39;m not even allowed to have other conversations much for the things I&amp;#39;m interested in. Then, of course, she gets mad at me when I show boredom. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. Since I&amp;#39;m unemployed, I&amp;#39;ve been delivering food using food delivery apps. And then she yells at me telling me I&amp;#39;m not doing enough of that and that I should deliver more so that I can afford rent. I feel lucky that she might be moving back to her home country soon because that would end this relationship by default. I don&amp;#39;t understand why it&amp;#39;s so hard to leave, especially a toxic and unhealthy relationship. I guess I&amp;#39;m afraid to feel alone because getting into a relationship is a serious and complicated task for me because I don&amp;#39;t have the that great social skills, I&amp;#39;m actually very awkward to be around with, which is the reason why I even have a hard time making friends. I&amp;#39;m the kind of person that doesn&amp;#39;t know what to say or how to say the things that I want to say. I&amp;#39;m also not all the attractive, nor in good shape and not all that healthy, so getting into another relationship almost feels impossible. But this one is toxic, so I understand that I really need to get out of this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as finding a new job, that hasn&amp;#39;t been easy. I&amp;#39;m not all that great at interviews, which I think is normal for most and I know I can land a job because I&amp;#39;ve done it before. But at the same time, I&amp;#39;m tired of working  9 to 5 jobs, just barely making enough on slave wage. Which is the reason I tried starting a couple of business, I&amp;#39;m just tired of this. I hate having to work to live and that I have live to work, what is that all about. I feel like life should be so much more than just work, eat, sleep, repeat and it&amp;#39;s causing me to be more and more depressed. I can&amp;#39;t handle it anymore. I don&amp;#39;t want to live like this, I hate this. I&amp;#39;ve tried so hard and I kept trying again and again and again. Always trying to find ways to find new strategies and try again but then keep watching myself fail over and over and over again that my hope that I use to have so much is hanging on by a thread. I&amp;#39;m only 30, but my health isn&amp;#39;t all the great and I feel like I might die by heart attack anytime soon, which scares me, but at the same time, I&amp;#39;d rather be dead. I think I&amp;#39;m starting to become suicidal because I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. I need help, but I can&amp;#39;t afford help. I&amp;#39;m in serious debt and lately, I&amp;#39;ve been getting lawsuit after lawsuit from creditors from unpaid debt from years ago because I couldn&amp;#39;t afford to pay for this or that, which is just adding more and more on my shoulders. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. I stay up late watching Youtube and playing video games until late to get away from the world and then sleep past noon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as good things that are happening, I&amp;#39;m seeing a talent agent next week because I really want to pursue theater and performing arts and thought I should really do something about it, but at the same time, I&amp;#39;m filled with anxiety. Because of my personality, because of my lack of social skills, I have this anxiety that I will be turned down. So I&amp;#39;m really hanging on to that hope that&amp;#39;s hanging on by a thread, hoping that this will work out, that I will pursue my dreams. But overall, I really need help in life and I just don&amp;#39;t know where to turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve gotten this far, I really want to thank you for sticking with my story this far. I know that was a lot. I&amp;#39;m really hoping somebody, anybody will really analyze everything I have written. Someone that can really look into this and provide me with the help I need as far as my mental health goes at the least. There&amp;#39;s so much more in my story that I haven&amp;#39;t mention, something much more severe that I went through not to long ago, perhaps that&amp;#39;ll be another post for another time because that was a very scary time of my life. But I hope that I can find what I need here in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;

So this is something I can't quite get over. The mainstay advice if you're unattractive is to basically get in shape and become physically fit. I've been going to the gym for 2 years, have made okay progress but honestly am not where I should be. Because I'm not at my potential looks-wise, I feel worthless about who I currently am. I don't want to be happy until I've reached my full potential and this is causing a lot of anguish. When I look at gym transformation pictures, I don't feel motivated to change myself. Instead I feel bitter and resentful about how much better my life would be if I looked good and feel pity for my current meek self. There is no logic to these feelings. Of course it would be better to be strong and have muscles than to not, but to me this is synonymous with the paradigm that until I've reached that goal, I basically suck and am worthless. I just can't stand the thought of people in the future liking me because I've reached (lets face it) an evolutionary standard of male attractiveness, whereas before that I was a loser worth no ones time.

Has anybody else dealt with this? I want to change for the better, but I also don't want the journey to be painful. I could really use an eye opener right now, or some book recommendations/general advice.

,mentalhealth,"I apologize if this is out of place for this reddit as a question for what essentially may seem like a request for a diagnosis, but please, hear me out first. I want to ask rather if it's worth checking into. I'm currently 16, close to 17, and living with my parents. I would have gone to them about this, but in the past they've tended to tell me that any concerns I have about myself are unfounded or will disappear in time. It's more of an optimistic outlook than them being negligent, but I still don't feel comfortable going directly to them about it.

  I think I might have social anxiety. I don't believe it's severe, but I think it could be affecting me in negative ways. I always feel nervous when interacting with people outside of my family. I always worry about whether or not they look down on me, whether or not they may have ulterior motives, and always try to consider the worst case scenario to make sure it's aborted. I can hardly carry on a good conversation with anyone outside of the few I am more comfortable with before stopping out of fearing how stupid they must see me. I can stand familiar, more organized collections of people, such as classrooms, but I find it difficult to even talk to most of these individuals, as I recognize them but don't know them personally. I'm currently in my Junior year of highschool, and even though I haven't had any problems with going to pep ralleys, (Which are essentially mandatory,) recently I've started skipping them due to the uncomfort they were giving me from everyone being crowded together. I am at my worst in more disorganized settings, say like at a party, and  with people I am unfamiliar with. Rarely can I muster any courage to overcome the fear that comes to talking with people I am unfamiliar with without feeling like impending doom is on the horizon. Because of these issues, I've started getting very frustrated with myself. I don't have any close friends, and I constantly fear putting off any casual friends I make, which has on several different occasions caused me to stop talking with them, and eventually lead to us drifting apart.

However, the worst moment I've had that I can remember in regards to a social setting was when I was going to sing the national anthem with my school's choir at a football game. I was still unfamiliar as to how I'd get in, whether or not I had to still pay for admission. My father had dropped me off and pulled right up near the entrance, and was waiting to see if everything would turn out okay. But just the idea of asking the admissions people was horrifying. After I eventually got out of the car, I started walking up to them but stopped before simply walking back and forth. Eventually, I heard my father call my name and I walked closer to talk, telling him I didn't think I felt comfortable doing it. After going back and forth, my dad, peeved about the situation, and asked for me. It's not a situation I'm proud of, and it still embarrasses me to this day. I've had similar situations where I've done okay with walking up and asking a random person a question, but it usually happened after a period of mental prep time until I felt ""ok"" enough to go and talk.

Again, I know this is a subreddit for mental health, and I understand it's primarily a platform for those suffering from mental illness. I feel bad about using this to ask, but as currently I don't feel comfortable talking to my parents about this, I thought, ""Hey, what the hell?"" The internet is the one place I don't feel constantly exposed, so I definitely felt more comfortable about asking this. My real question is whether or not this is worth getting checked out with someone. If this seems more like shyness or social awkwardness than anything else, then obviously it's probably not worth the time. However, even if it's possible, could I try to ride it out? I don't expect an official diagnosis, but I guess I just wanted some other opinions before I jump to any crazy conclusions.

I want to ask rather if it&amp;#39;s worth checking into. I&amp;#39;m currently 16, close to 17, and living with my parents. I would have gone to them about this, but in the past they&amp;#39;ve tended to tell me that any concerns I have about myself are unfounded or will disappear in time. It&amp;#39;s more of an optimistic outlook than them being negligent, but I still don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable going directly to them about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I might have social anxiety. I don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s severe, but I think it could be affecting me in negative ways. I always feel nervous when interacting with people outside of my family. I always worry about whether or not they look down on me, whether or not they may have ulterior motives, and always try to consider the worst case scenario to make sure it&amp;#39;s aborted.

,mentalhealth,"Hi all

I'm making this post regarding ""episodes"" I had when I was younger. If it is of any help, I have struggled with OCD throughout my teens and still am, although I doubt this is relevant.

While living in France between the ages of 8-14, I would often have periods lasting weeks where I would question every single thing around me.

 It's hard to describe but I would ask myself questions such as ""Why is the floor like this ?, Why can I touch ?, What is hearing ?"" , it was as if I was being overwhelmed by my senses while also having an existential crisis if that makes sense. 

Something else to note is that I used to always call what I felt ""The feeling"" as I had no other way of describing it at the time. I also remember it being triggered by the cramped attic in my house as well as the emptiness and quietness of the area, as it was a very rural.

I am now 17 and haven't had anything similar happen for a good few years now, but it has always bugged me because I've never heard of anything similar from anybody I know, I never knew why it happened in the first place or what I was even experiencing. I also worry that it could creep up on me again as this was usually what would happen back when these ""episodes"" were much more frequent. 

I know that I would be able to get much more help out of a professional (Which I plan to seek help from), but I've never actually taken the time to write any of this down. If anybody reading this can relate or can think of what this sounds like please let me know, I would appreciate it very much.

,mentalhealth,"Attempt 3 at writing this. I’m on a throwaway account and please bear with me since it’s a bit difficult to put into words. 

So I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety. It’s gotten to the point where I’m pretty much not going outside during the day and just staying in my room away from anyone who could hurt me. I’m too afraid to talk about my feelings, possibly due to talking to someone a while ago who said that they would help and they just said that I was ‘silly’. 

To make the next part hopefully easier to understand I’ll call myself H. 

I feel like I’m a mask or a shell of a person and the real H is hidden inside. I’m pretty sure there’s someone blocking the real H from actually coming back out into this world. It’s like they’re telling me I have to complete certain things of a challenge to get the real H back into the actual world. 

The real H is like a ‘normal person’ would be. However they’re never actually here since it’s as if they’re trapped. On the other hand I feel like I’m controlled by people on what I should wear, eat or say. 

Sometimes I feel completely disassociated from the world and other times I feel as if everything I’m seeing is in a movie. Sometimes I feel happy as a human can possibly get (and as of recent I’ve noticed I also tend to ‘want’ to spend more money when I feel like that) and other times I have no interest in absolutely anything. 

I feel like I can keep going but at this point there’s probably no barrier between reality and a fake world. I have animals to care for (3 hamsters) which are helping I guess?

It’s like they’re telling me I have to complete certain things of a challenge to get the real H back into the actual world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real H is like a ‘normal person’ would be. However they’re never actually here since it’s as if they’re trapped. On the other hand I feel like I’m controlled by people on what I should wear, eat or say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel completely disassociated from the world and other times I feel as if everything I’m seeing is in a movie. Sometimes I feel happy as a human can possibly get (and as of recent I’ve noticed I also tend to ‘want’ to spend more money when I feel like that) and other times I have no interest in absolutely anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I can keep going but at this point there’s probably no barrier between reality and a fake world. I have animals to care for (3 hamsters) which are helping I guess? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been listening to more and more positive songs recently. I guess that’s a step forward? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for making you read this post. I needed somewhere to drop this that wasn’t going to annoy anyone. If this breaks any rules feel free to remove.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone. I’ve never made a post and I hope I’m doing this right. I just really want someone to talk to about how I’ve felt since me and my ex girlfriend broke up. It might sound like a small thing but it’s really impacted my life since and I bottle up all the emotions because I don’t feel comfortable talking to most people about it properly. My ex girlfriend struggled with depression (still does) for years before we went out but it started to get bad again towards the end of our relationship, and the stress of the relationship mixed with it was her reason for breaking things off. Anyways she ended up being really mean to me afterwards, saying stuff like she didn’t love or miss me and just generally making fun of me. It was a big shock because I still loved her and didn’t understand her reason for being so mean, and it put me in a really dark place. I wanted to reach out to her but she wouldn’t talk to me seriously and I was so confused as to what I did wrong. A few weeks after the break up I started going into these dissociative states sometimes which were really scary, and got a few small panic attacks. I’ve been really down aswell, and I find it hard to see how things can possibly get much better. The breakup was 3 months ago and I just want to know what I can do to not feel so bad all the time. Any help or discussion would be really appreciated.
Thanks guys!

,mentalhealth,"Hi,

I was super depressed.  Like critically and considering bad things.  

I'm in a very serious Kung Fu school.  I was practicing in front of a teacher's aid.  And he was correcting my form.  The Kung Fu needs to be practiced daily and we don't always get to practice in front of someone who is taught how to coach someone.

And he told me I have to smile.  Otherwise I am just teaching myself to be angry.  I thought it was ridiculous.  But I did it because I have insane amount of respect for the Master of the school.  

So whenever I'm in pain in my work out, I just smile.  That turned into giggling and laughter.  

And then that slowly spread to other parts of my life.   I started jogging, and on the uphills I would just smile.  I think my legs are going to fall off, but I'm smiling. 

I learned that joy, happiness, and optimism are wonderful feelings.  But they also can be a discipline.  They can be learned, practiced, and repeated on demand.

Even if you don't believe this, I bet if someone showed up and gave you a birthday cake, and said Happy Birthday.  Even if it wasn't your birthday, you would smile, and most likely laugh.  So everyone is capable of learning this.  

I have recovered from depression, addressed anger issues, I'm super productive and work 16 hours a day, happily.  I even had a huge blow out with my family and somehow it didn't turn into a complete nightmare that takes years to heal.  We just accepted each other's feelings and moved on and started to rebuild a more functional relationship.  Like in a few weeks!

So maybe this could help one of you.  I know you care about yourself and others because you are on this sub.  

So maybe you can work out, or jog.  And practice smiling while doing it.  You can train your brain the way I did.  Hopefully someone finds this helpful.

,mentalhealth,"So, let me tell you about how I'm feeling and if anyone has any clue of what the hell is happening to me, I'd be very thankful.

During all three years of high school, I had this group of friends, and always felt like I had to give my all to be part of the group, bend to their likes and tastes and manners and etc, I changed a lot of my habits because it annoyed them, that kind of things. I was always dedicating myself so that I could be part of the group and very frequently I felt that they treated me very badly, many times I felt humiliated and ridiculed, but I never managed to tell them about how I felt, neither could I step out of the group because I thought that it was either that or not having any friends at all.

So I always suppressed my feelings (as I do with everything, actually).

However, these feelings that I so suppressed for so long now came to the surface and I feeling extremly angry and mad at them. I can't even talk to them anymore, we have a group chat in which I stopped talking. Even when they talk to me in the group chat, I just pretend I didn't see the text and ignore it completely because I can't put myself to talk to them. Yesterday, one of them asked in said group chat if I was mad at them and I continued to ignore because I just can't tell them that yes, I am.

Yesterday, one of them asked in said group chat if I was mad at them and I continued to ignore because I just can&amp;#39;t tell them that yes, I am. And that&amp;#39;s why I don&amp;#39;t leave the group chat either; if I do, it&amp;#39;ll be clear that something is going on, and for some reason I can&amp;#39;t manage to tell them already.&lt;/p&gt;

Generally I feel nothing, as if I'm just walking around and doing stuff pretending that I'm alive. But I feel so dazed and numb. However, if something bad happens I usually feel it so much. I want to hurt people or myself. Sometimes the anger takes time to catch up.

,mentalhealth,"I always had people tell me how going to a therapist changed Their life and how happy and better they feel in life but I never really felt comfortable myself to go and talk to a therapist until last year ....... Last year I was facing some really serious anxity , depression and I was having mental breakdowns in class or in school washroom I even became extremely suicidal that is when I thought I need to see a therapist or a counselor but being from an Indian family I knew I couldn't ask my parents for it so I decided to try my school therapist .

The first therapist I met was not from my school she was a specialist that our school hired who came to school 2 times a week and helps people .... The first time I met her I had a full on mental breakdown and I cried and told her about my feelings and showed her my scares that I had from cutting my wrist and she was really nice she gave me good advice and I left there feeling more happy and relieved ( although I know it's common sense that a therapist doesn't share personal cases of their patients with anyone but still I made sure to tell her again and again that I don't want my parents to know that I am seeing a therapist ) ... A few days later my father was called into the school by my therapist and she told my father all the reason of be being depressed I know she thought it would be helpful but it just caused more problems cause when I went home my father was really angry at me and be said really bad that's to me and yelled at me for hours that just made me more disturbed .

A few days later our school hired another school counselor who I got to know about cause she used to call many people to her office for sessions ( people who were trouble makers or like that ) and one day she comes to my class and she is like does anyone needs help and I said yes she called me in her office and we talk for a while and she listened and gave really good advice and I told her the same thing I told the last counselor that not to disclose this information with anyone cause I don't want my parents to know and she reassured me that it won't happen , these sessions went on for weeks and I was getting better but around that time I had a really bad mental breakdown in my class and I was screaming and I ran away from class crying ( because I lost pretty much all my friends and I was alone and my home situation at that time was worse and everything was just affecting me a lot and I was also being assaulted by school boys ) and I went to her and I said some stuff like. "" I don't wanna live anymore "" and idk if that made her scared or something but she told the head of the department about this who then called "" my previous therapist "" and both of those counselors then called my parents and told them every little detail of my life that I shared with them .

,mentalhealth,"I think its very possible I have some sort of disorder or phobia and it really bugs me often. There's a lot of small particular things and whatnot but ill describe them all now. 

Ever since I was young maybe 7 or 8, I have been very annoyed by the number nine. It kind of makes me anxious and irritated similar to when you don't feel like speaking or when someone won't stop talking. I cannot leave any tv on volume level nine or I am very displaced. That number is just wrong and shouldn't exist is how I feel. Not sure if its because its so close to being a 10 or 8 but I don't know. 

I often imagine lines that extend off of items or other things. Like a box will have 2 lines come off of each corner and the same goes for tables and really anything else. Well when I step on these lines I get minority irritated and it kinda just builds up to annoy me or make me walk certain ways. 

When I tap something I have to tap 3 more times to complete the pattern and if not I get left with that irritated feeling again. I always need to make it go left right right left. I use both fingers arms legs or even just flexing a muscle. 

Very often I get anxiety about certain things like leaving a charger in an outlet to make sure it doesn't catch fire or sometimes ill triple check that I did something. At work I check every order I put in about 3 or 4 times or I'm anxious and uncomfortable. 

Tattoos make me very uncomfortable and when someone has one, I feel like they're tainted. I lost a very valuable, long relationship because my girlfriend got a tattoo despite knowing about my fear/discomfort of them. After that she wasn't attractive to me. Not beautiful or gorgeous like before. I tried to ignore my annoyance of it, but it was so much I couldn't touch her. 

Often if a cup, plate, wipe, pencil ECT is even near something dirty, I will feel that its tainted (very similar to a tattoo) and I don't wanna use it or have to wash it. 

My silverware, napkins ECT when I eat out need to be finely arranged in front of me or I'm feel gross and annoyed. All my friends or (ex) girlfriends have always jokingly rearranged it to look poor and it makes me feel very upset. It ruins my mood and makes me sick of being there. 

This is all kinda affecting my life I feel like all in small ways, but it overall ends up to be more. Sometimes these things aren't as active but it tends to be when I am focused on other things.

,mentalhealth,"So I have this roommate. He’s a homeless guy my mom befriended and got him to move in to the trailer in our driveway.

He had obvious mental issues. He says he’s being targeted. Hears threatening voices, sees things out of the corner of his eye like people driving by and flipping him off, the whole 9 yards.

He watches a lot of YouTube videos from other “Targeted Individuals” which is very unhelpful of course.

He has also been having some kind of legal issues that I think are unrelated, but I don’t know the details. So whenever he has a court date coming up or anything like that his symptoms really come out. Recently he contacted the FBI and gave them whatever evidence he has. So that has got him going recently.

Today he’s just been pacing around the house seesawing between sobbing, and strings of cusswords. He’s in a very cyclical thought pattern so he’ll say one thing, that leads to the next thing and then another thing that leads back to the first thing like that.

He keeps trying to corner me or my mom to go off on his tangent about being targeted and how unfair it is, but we’ve both heard it a thousand times and it’s just tiresome when we’re just trying to watch TV. And since we’re not psychiatrists we don’t have any real helpful advice for him.

All I know about these targeted individual types is that denying what they’re experiencing and suggesting they get help just drives them further into the fantasy. But doing nothing and just letting him work up into these frenzies doesn’t seem right either.

He’s a homeless guy my mom befriended and got him to move in to the trailer in our driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had obvious mental issues. He says he’s being targeted. Hears threatening voices, sees things out of the corner of his eye like people driving by and flipping him off, the whole 9 yards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He watches a lot of YouTube videos from other “Targeted Individuals” which is very unhelpful of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has also been having some kind of legal issues that I think are unrelated, but I don’t know the details. So whenever he has a court date coming up or anything like that his symptoms really come out. Recently he contacted the FBI and gave them whatever evidence he has. So that has got him going recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today he’s just been pacing around the house seesawing between sobbing, and strings of cusswords. He’s in a very cyclical thought pattern so he’ll say one thing, that leads to the next thing and then another thing that leads back to the first thing like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He keeps trying to corner me or my mom to go off on his tangent about being targeted and how unfair it is, but we’ve both heard it a thousand times and it’s just tiresome when we’re just trying to watch TV. And since we’re not psychiatrists we don’t have any real helpful advice for him.&lt;/p&gt;

It makes no seance and i cant get him his medications without it. (Out of pocket, his shot is 3 grand.) ever seance he was committed, i have been unable to get his health insurance information(thanks HIPPA),  i think they gave him a new one? Maybe? But we have yet to hear a word about this “new insurance.” I’m worried the drive will trigger him and make him less willing to go to the doctors appointment we have set up for his shot (you know, if i can figure out his insurance) next week.

,mentalhealth,"I know, i know, some may say this is romanticism of mental illness but that's not my goal here. There's so many times that my health has nearly cost my life and negatively impacted those i love. I'm not discounting or negating that fact. 

However, i do want to acknowledge that everyone has strengths and the experiences we go through can cause for some interesting and surprising adaptations for us to survive in the world that on occasion may provide an advantage from time to time. So no, not romanticism, just adaptive learning that many haven't grown a skill for. 

For example, my diagnoses in order of when i got them between the ages of 23 to 34 and now 35 fyi... Anxiety, depression, bipolar, panic disorder, adhd, ptsd and autism (Aspergers). So, some particular ""flavors"" or ""traits"" that it shows is that when i do something, that's all that i do. Doesn't matter if it's positive like cooking, sewing, working, contacting people or sabotaging behavior like watching videos in bed when i need to start my day, spending money i don't have or playing games when i should be working/cleaning. The end result is chronic disorganization and many things (and often people) get pushed aside. So, most of my life I've lived in mild to moderate hoarding conditions. Yes, this has and still has negative impacts on my life, no denial there. 

But there's an interesting fact i noticed...

What do people who have hoarding behaviors have in common with pecan pickers?

They are able to step lightly so they don't break what they find valuable and look at the small details of a pile to find what they want inexplicably faster than most people. So, i was laid off my job and needed some cash for Christmas. I live in a part of the country that buys pecans wholesale from growers and the public which usually pays 3× or more what collecting cans does. It was already late in the season with only about 3 weeks of a 3 month season left. My mom owns about 5 mature pecan trees and i got permission to pick in her neighbor's yard while he was gone. In that amount of time with very little day light (i can't ever get out of bed before noon) with a rake, leaf blower and a couple storage bins, i picked over 200 lbs by myself. Most people do that over the entire season. So, i was able to pay my phone bill and get gas money so i could do other gigs while waiting for more work to come it.

I also have used my lack of selective attention and hyperfocus to produce alot of sewing projects. I made my winter wardobe one year in one day. Also, i even turned some of my ""negative"" flavors of binging YouTube into saving the lives of kittens and prevented a kidnapping for someone else (don't recommend. Please learn to stay alert of your surroundings at all times and know how-to describe your location quickly and accurately at all times. Something i learned from work. Long story)  
Also, since i have attention and memory problems, i have learned to never rely on memory at all. So i have gotten really good at using google products, namely google docs. So i can send my resume on command, remember important medical info for myself or animals, be able to reference facts people told me etc. The way it has helped me the most was being the sole witness to a car accident. I knew the police weren't going to come since it was a busy weekend. So i wrote down what i saw and google docs has a time stamp. Now the poor guy has to go to court and i don't have to live with the anxiety of some dumbass hot shot lawyer being all abelist in my face and cause the jury to doubt me/question my memory.

,mentalhealth,"Hi everyone. I made a throwaway for this, but am active on Reddit.

I am a 35F who has had a Borderline diagnosis for 15 years. Today, I was also diagnosed with Bipolar tendencies. The last time I was manic was about 8-10 years ago when I obsessively played WoW for about a year with little sleep and not much care for anything. If you want to laugh along with me (because it's sort of funny, and humor is the only thing getting me through this), my current bout of mania is being hyperfocused on knitting. My kids are taking care of, but I am choosing to knit over cleaning the house, personal hygiene, sleep, and even work at times. I'm slightly sad about this revelation because I've been knitting since I was 7, but I recently decided to turn it into a business. I've made a little money, but more importantly, I have made friends, real ones, for the first time in my adult life. I have self-confidence I never had before, and I was feeling really good about everything, especially since I only work from home, and the idea of starting a business was really exciting. Now that it seems it's just a bout of mania, it's a bit of a punch in the gut. My doctor says if I can learn balance, I can continue on, which is a relief because knitting is something I have always loved. I didn't even realize it was becoming a ""problem"" until recently, and when my psychiatrist started to mention the diagnosis today, I was upset, though agreed, something was definitely ""off.""

Anyhow, now that we're done laughing at the fact I have the strangest mania obsession ever and I clearly must also be 80-years-old (hello Borderline, I usually age slide into my teens, but maybe I've slid into geriatrics?), I have a real-life issue. I have a low sex drive. I have two young kids (3 and 4) but I don't think it's because of them. Me and my partner get time alone, and I just have zero interest most of the time. I can go months and not care. Once we start, I'm into it, but I want to want it (I hope that makes sense). I am on Cipralex, Topiramate, and Seroquel, and am about to add Lithium. Is there anything I can do to want to have sex, other than just doing it? My partner isn't pressuring me at all. But I want to do it for them, and also for me (please don't turn this into something it isn't - no one is forcing me, and I don't think there is an expectation.

I've always had a slight droning of nihilism in the background. Some air of meaninglesness. This wasn't depression either. It was a philosophical thing. I had a lack of faith in people. I saw the worst in them. I also struggled to come to terms with death, which caused some dissociation.

,mentalhealth,"Bear with me it's quite a long wrap around of a story.

Background story, 25 M, Bisexual but only out officially to a very select few, I was outed in high school but people quickly forgot because that's high school.

So, I don't really know how to start this so I'll do my best. My birthday was the 4th of November, the Thursday two weeks before my parents tried contacting my girlfriend several times throughout the day, me, being the stubborn optimist thought it was to surprise me for my 25th. I went about my day none the wiser, work, gym, Thursday grocery shop. My girlfriend was overly affectionate throughout the grocery shop, and I just thought she had a bad day.

Half an hour after we get home my dad (he lives 200 kms away) and my brother (almost 350 kms) arrive, unannounced at my house, and inform me, that my cousin who I grew up with, was extremely close with, who was my first ally when I was outed as bisexual, committed suicide. Even now, I have not actually said the words out loud, even though I carried him to the hearse.

Lately, and when I mean lately, I mean almost every night since the 24th of October, I have had trouble sleeping, if I don't have a couple of alcoholic beverages, I struggle to get any decent sleep, which I don't like, considering I'm a PT and prided myself on being healthy and strong. My father told me to suck it up and that his parents were doing it worse, so I guess I've bottled it all inside, and it's cracking through, breaking down on boxing day, lack of sleep, irritability. 

I think about death a lot, but I do not want to die, however it's the unbearable dread of the notion, and the feeling of why did he die, when me myself, of the same age am still here? Is it fair if I was to succeed in life where he is no longer with us? He mentioned he wanted to speak to someone but was scared they'd take his guns away, which at this point i wish he did.

We swore after our grandfather died ""of a broken heart"" that we would always be there for each other  but i failed him and its ripping me apart inside. The guilt is suffocating.

I'm fearful of seeking help as I don't want to be seen as at risk. I do not want to harm myself. At all. I'm just not sure how to feel, or if my suppression is helping me move on or make me more bitter.

,mentalhealth,"Forgive me because this might be a long post for a first time Redditor like me. I've been looking for sites where I could write my story. A friend introduced me to Reddit to browse memes (so if he read this I might drop out) instead of other websites. I haven't really used it since I downloaded it so here's like my first interaction with this.  


Just like the title suggest, I'm afraid to seek help. Well, as much as possible I would like to be anonymous but I don't know how to keep anonymity in Reddit. I also don't tell others my problems in person just like in social media.  Currently, I had already deactivated most of my social media accounts tho, except Instagram, although I don't open it as much as I did and archived thousand of my posts...  


One of my problems is that I forget what they are. So I'm often left sad without any reason why I'm just sad. It started when I was younger at the peak of my puberty where I'm too anxious about everything I do and when I did something that is considered embarrassing for me but normal for others, I imagine there's a vault of memories on the back of my head where I store all my ""bad memories"" and forget them. Looking back, I used to ""open"" it and just remember all the embarrassing things I did, well I don't remember why. Then it came a time where I couldn't open that vault and it takes all my mem'ries, the ""good"" and the ""bad"". I think it took a toll on my emotions as I grew up.  


So I'm already 18 and recently came out to my parents. Well, I thought they fuuullyy accepted me and told me they were open-minded and was fine with it. About my sexuality, hmm. I don't know how to tell you the entirety of it because I'm really new to it too because I recently (well years ago tho, like 2-3) decided to think about it. So basically I was so straight (acting like one though) but I thought it was natural, I grew up like it and thinking I was straight so I thought I was tho. But you know, this is sooo new to me, the lingo, actions, everything! So when my parents asked me to explain, I really don't know the answer. So back to my parents, a day after I opened up to them, my mom called me and asked me a series of questions and lecturing me about what a bad decision this was. Although I was quiet the whole time, a little teary-eyed (I don't want to show her I was crying because it would show that I was weak and am not ready to make that decision) so with all my power within me I stopped my myself from crying and my voice from quivering. Then I said, ""Why are you like this to me? I opened up to my friends and classmates and they treated me the same as if nothing has happened. You're supposed to be the one who should understand me first before them."" then she answered this and it was too intense I went to my room, ""You've become gayer. How would we understand if you don't tell us."" (I forgot to mention that they said ""they already knew"" when I came out""). Then the next day after that, whilst I was having my brunch (It was a Saturday) she went to sit with me on the table and talked with me (Again, it was more of a one-sided conversation as I stayed quiet the whole time).  She said this, ""About the thing, you said to us the other day, you're dad was really disappointed because he has hopes for you. He would understand and accept you sooner, just give him time.""  


Fast forward, my mom's **changed**. We used to be extremely religious (Roman Catholic), I grew up praying the Rosary every night while kneeling down (oftentimes, seiza style). So as I grew up I have learned a lot and of course, in our generation, there is an answer to almost all questions with the use of your phone. I have kept myself but I don't think I could call myself religious, tho I love and respect all religions (I think that is when I started to take a step back to mine). So yeah like I said earlier, she has somewhat changed. Although she prays before going to work, now she does these rituals. I'm not used to sudden changes to I called her out while we're eating dinner. ""Why are you doing this? This is all just a scam or fakery (I don't know the proper term), who do you really believe in? We're Catholics, we're supposed to believe in one God. (I know this part became a little religious, I'm sorry guys, please bear with me) Technically, there is no ""God"" in your rituals so who do you do ""it"" for? Please stop this already."" So that escalated weeks later, I was taking an afternoon nap 'cause why not? It's the weekend. She called me to her room and told me, ""You, (my name), stop with your negativity! You're ruining this for me and for the energy coming in this house! I'm not doing this just for me but for us family!"" (It's too long I forgot the rest) So I was tired and still dazed because I just woke up so I said, ""I don't want to talk about this right now, I'm going back to my room."" While walking back to my room she was shouting, ""Come back here! I am not done talking with you!"" So I was lying on my bed my sister walked into my room looking for something, a charger maybe. Then my mom busted through the door with flaming eyes and shouting, (I forgot most of it because like I was, I was sleepy all my emotions are turned off that time and my sister was still at my room and now stuck in the situation). So she pulled my blanket but could only pull half of it as I was holding the other end. So when she realized that she let go and started pointing at me (I was pulling back my blanket at the time)  


""You've been too much for this family! You think you're so smart, you're not! You have not contributed anything yet you're so boastful! Demon! When you came out we accepted you and you're still like this!"" (My sister doesn't know I came out, well that saved me the trouble) She called me a lot of nasty things which I couldn't translate, but she called me a Demon several times, and for me who grew up religious that is something for me. So when that happened, I officially became the black sheep of the family **\*applause**\*  


Writing this is mentally draining because it takes effort to remember stuff accurately. Are you still here with me?  


This happened weeks ago and as of now, she speaks to me in a soft tone. Well I know she's doing that to forgive her, well I don't? Well, I'm doing all my duties as their eldest although there's really no feelings left. I don't think I could recover from this, I have already considered myself as dirt and demon as they have suggested.  


I grew up having only myself to support me. I cried extremely silently if they ever caught me, I'd get ""lovely beating"" because **men shouldn't cry**. I have only publicly cried in front of my previous adviser when I lost my phone and in front of my previous professor. It really takes effort to keep composure is not? I literally have no one to tell my feelings, problems, and rants. I don't have anyone to lash out, I'm just by myself. I have a lot of friends though, but we're not on the level to tell our problems.  


So in my class, I joined this clique (one of their ""leader"" or member was kicked out and I think they were looking for replacements so I was that one but I drag along a friend so it's not hard for me to adjust) They used to gossip and make fun about me when the classes just started because of my hair. At that time I was growing my hair because I shaved my head the previous year (at the time it was my way to vent? It's crazy I know that is why I grew it out) So when I grew it out, it was ugly, I know! It's all spiky mohawk like spiky. They called me names like McSundae and Spiky (like the name of a dog). I'm extremely receptive, even though I was erasing the writings on the board, I could hear them clearly and see their reflection through the glass board. I may be ambivert but I'm not a dumb one. I never confronted them about this until I joined their clique and admitted that I knew from the start. Then after I joined their clique, a few weeks (maybe months) have passed and I started to smell bad! Like bad-bad! I couldn't stop or control it, I used products to stop it but all failed. It's because my anxiety came back (well I was not diagnosed but it is what it is) then I heard whispers again and they started picking on me again jokingly this time, but I knooow. It's gone now though, I'm really glad. Until now they didn't know that I knew.  


In the clique, this was this girl that I got close to and I thought I could trust her. But now the others are teasing her with a boy who used to blatantly bully me the previous years. Of course, I don't want to ruin our friendship and their growing romance so I don't tell her that he used to hurt me. Then my only escape, my friend, was gone. I couldn't trust her anymore, well maybe I do, but I don't know. I don't want to interact with anyone who's affiliated with that boy.  


So last year, my friend wants me to introduce myself to the school guidance counselor which helped him and two others from our class. So one day I said yes, but when we came to her office I chickened out. Luckily there was a research convention in our school at the time and she wanted to come and I used that to get out of there but I went with her and got to know her a little. She was really kind and extremely intelligent! She gave me her one and only chocolate. I'm embarrassed to talk with her again, I really want to but I can't it's too embarrassing to tell her this story of mine.  


I am not suicidal (yet I think) but there's always a thought in my head that I want to do it but I don't (confusing? a'ight) If only if I decided to do it, I want to do it quickly with no pain. Again, it's just a thought. I'm afraid to seek professional help because I'm afraid of the truth (that I might be depressed). I don't want to open up to my friends because I know they have problems too, I really do, they had told me and I listened. I feel like they'd laugh at me or something like that and think ""Just because of that you're like that?"". This is my form of venting out. It feels so great doing this. If you finished this, daaamn!

I&amp;#39;ve been looking for sites where I could write my story. A friend introduced me to Reddit to browse memes (so if he read this I might drop out) instead of other websites. I haven&amp;#39;t really used it since I downloaded it so here&amp;#39;s like my first interaction with this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the title suggest, I&amp;#39;m afraid to seek help. Well, as much as possible I would like to be anonymous but I don&amp;#39;t know how to keep anonymity in Reddit. I also don&amp;#39;t tell others my problems in person just like in social media.  Currently, I had already deactivated most of my social media accounts tho, except Instagram, although I don&amp;#39;t open it as much as I did and archived thousand of my posts...  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my problems is that I forget what they are. So I&amp;#39;m often left sad without any reason why I&amp;#39;m just sad. It started when I was younger at the peak of my puberty where I&amp;#39;m too anxious about everything I do and when I did something that is considered embarrassing for me but normal for others, I imagine there&amp;#39;s a vault of memories on the back of my head where I store all my &amp;quot;bad memories&amp;quot; and forget them.

,mentalhealth,"Well i am somehow in a really strange situation, i have started an internship in a local startup and i really love everthing about it, the work and the people are all great. I do get real and important tasks. For the first time in my life (21M), I have the feeling of doing something useful and getting recognition and praise for my work. 

Now to the problem. Whenever i show my coworkers or bosses something on my laptop or just discussing something with them i somehow get the urge to kiss them even though they are all men too. I have depression but haven't had a phase for like 2-3 years. i never got any medications for it or went to a therapist. 

My guess is am just so love-deprived that it causes these urges. I do have a family which i do dislike and never get any appreciation and not really from anywhere else.

I've had two relationships so far, my first GF was emotionally abusive and i broke up when i noticed i didn't enjoy the relationship. My second relationship was really great i loved her to the core of my heart. Well also this relationship ended because she realized we didn't fit together after like one and a half years and only because she never told me anything that bothered her, i thought i was always encouraging to share everything with eachother because talking to each other is the most important thing. She broke then up rather suddenly via text and now i see we didnt fit well enough and we had some problems, but it took a lot from me and i have trust issues ever since.

Ever since i never had a relationship because i don't want to get to know other girls because i am afraid of getting hurt.

&lt;p&gt;My guess is am just so love-deprived that it causes these urges. I do have a family which i do dislike and never get any appreciation and not really from anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had two relationships so far, my first GF was emotionally abusive and i broke up when i noticed i didn&amp;#39;t enjoy the relationship. My second relationship was really great i loved her to the core of my heart. Well also this relationship ended because she realized we didn&amp;#39;t fit together after like one and a half years and only because she never told me anything that bothered her, i thought i was always encouraging to share everything with eachother because talking to each other is the most important thing. She broke then up rather suddenly via text and now i see we didnt fit well enough and we had some problems, but it took a lot from me and i have trust issues ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since i never had a relationship because i don&amp;#39;t want to get to know other girls because i am afraid of getting hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly i don&amp;#39;t know what to do, i sure can live with this situation but it is really weird to wnt to kiss your 35y old Boss all the time, especially as i don&amp;#39;t consider myself gay.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel so alone. This is my fourth I think mental breakdown of January, and things just seem to get worse. I feel like my friends aren't there for me, all of them seem to be in a relationship or in a good friendship and I am just in the background. The people I really want to hang out don't seem to care about whether I am there or not. This is even harder to cope with since I am still in the closet. All of them are Christian, I am most likely the gay one out of all of them, this makes it so so so hard to hang out with the people I want to hang with, and even tougher to be in a relationship. And It makes it even worse when I see people all around me happy with people who actually give a shit whether they are going to make to the event or not, or whether everything is doing alright with them. On my social media feeds, I see happy couples, doing things couples would do, and deep deep down, there is a part of me that knows that I may never get that. Then I see the gays, some closeted some not. The ones who or not, happily being them, being who they really are and I am terrified of what people will think of me. I can't be girly, I can't hang out with the people I really want to,  I just can't do it. I barely hang out with anybody, since I am homeschooled, I don't go to public school so I don't see people that I would call my friends on a daily basis. I feel secluded in my room, typing this, tears running down my face, rather than talking to a close friend. My school work piles on me constantly, I am always finishing things at the last minute and I never really get the weekend off. I have anxiety and social anxiety so I find it hard to go out in public to try and build friendships with people.

I just feel like everything is stacked against me, no social life, the fact that I am homeschooled, restricting how much I get out of the house, my anxiety, being gay and wanting a relationship and not being able to truly express myself, and that limiting me in pretty much everything I do. My life just feels like a checklist, my mom has everything planned out for me in high school, and is expecting me to go to college, but what I really want to do for a living is to be on youtube or twitch, doing the things I love, and having a loving and supporting community, which I could really use in times like these.

,mentalhealth,"Hey y'all. This is my first post on here so I apologize if I break any rules. I did read them to be safe but I just wanted to throw that in just in case.

I am a 36 year old woman who has had 3 children. My oldest (may my sweet girl RIP) would have been 19 next march and my youngest just turned 12. I did not have very many symptoms until after I had my first Angel but they really hit hard and all at one time. Also, she passed away st 6 weeks old which is pain I will never stop feeling. I have just learned to do the best I can but there is no way to ever not feel the loss of a child IMO. About 2 years after she was born, (she had passed a year and 8 months before this as well) I  was diagnosed with Bipolar type 1, Schizo effective disorder and severe GAD. It was vary hard dealing with those and being a new mom of an Angel and I always prayed it was severe PPD and depression from burying my babygirl and it would go away but sadly that didn't happen.

I do feel blessed that I have never had severe issues with the Schizo effective effective disorder like many other have to deal with. For many years, it was just  auditory hillusinations and paranoia where I always think people are staring and talking about me but for the past 5 years or so, the voice (its always been just the one male voice but the things he says are beyond terrible. (I would imagine anyone who suffers with any form of hallucinations, especially visual ones. That would horrify me) about 5 or so years ago it seemed like all three of my diagnoses became 1,000 times more severe at the same time and I have no idea why.

OK want to add that I am a heroin addict who has been in recovery for 8 years now which I sure has to have something to do with it but why didn't it start until after 3 years of sobriety? I take 1200 mg of Lithium a day, They upped my Depekote from 250 mg to 500 mg extended release and also put me on 2 mg of Klonopin 3 times a day but haven't had them since I moved from NY in 2012.  nothing is getting better and I am so lost and feel so hopeless and have no idea what to do! I am uninsured so I go to a clinic that has sliding scale fees and normally they are still very good doctors but sadly the only I see now doesn't listen to me at all. For months I have stayed in a bad anxious state where I just know something is really wrong but don't know what is and can never figure out what it is and the panic attacks have become so severe that I have called the EMTs at least 10 times in a month. Last week I Passed out from a a panic attack and the EMTs that come every single time I call, made me go to the hospital but after Trying on 4 different BP machines including a manual one, my BP stayes so high that none couls get a reading. The hospital is 30 mons away and it wast until halfway there and even at that poont, the bottom number was 133 which is beyond stroke level. Even though I have felt the same feeling for over 16 years, each one is still  terrifying because of how fast my heart rate gets and how high my blood pressure gets. I have barely slept on months because the voice has gotten so loud and so constant that it keeps me awake. If there are any Supernatural fans in here, it feels so much like what Sam went through when Cas broke down the wall in his brain making him go insane from his time in the Cage and he was constantly Hallucinating that Luci was with him st all times, singing or throwing those poppers on the ground all night which caused him to almost doe from lack of sleep.

This is my first post on here so I apologize if I break any rules. I did read them to be safe but I just wanted to throw that in just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a 36 year old woman who has had 3 children. My oldest (may my sweet girl RIP) would have been 19 next march and my youngest just turned 12. I did not have very many symptoms until after I had my first Angel but they really hit hard and all at one time. Also, she passed away st 6 weeks old which is pain I will never stop feeling. I have just learned to do the best I can but there is no way to ever not feel the loss of a child IMO. About 2 years after she was born, (she had passed a year and 8 months before this as well) I  was diagnosed with Bipolar type 1, Schizo effective disorder and severe GAD. It was vary hard dealing with those and being a new mom of an Angel and I always prayed it was severe PPD and depression from burying my babygirl and it would go away but sadly that didn&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do feel blessed that I have never had severe issues with the Schizo effective effective disorder like many other have to deal with. For many years, it was just  auditory hillusinations and paranoia where I always think people are staring and talking about me but for the past 5 years or so, the voice (its always been just the one male voice but the things he says are beyond terrible. (I would imagine anyone who suffers with any form of hallucinations, especially visual ones. That would horrify me) about 5 or so years ago it seemed like all three of my diagnoses became 1,000 times more severe at the same time and I have no idea why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK want to add that I am a heroin addict who has been in recovery for 8 years now which I sure has to have something to do with it but why didn&amp;#39;t it start until after 3 years of sobriety? I take 1200 mg of Lithium a day, They upped my Depekote from 250 mg to 500 mg extended release and also put me on 2 mg of Klonopin 3 times a day but haven&amp;#39;t had them since I moved from NY in 2012.  nothing is getting better and I am so lost and feel so hopeless and have no idea what to do! I am uninsured so I go to a clinic that has sliding scale fees and normally they are still very good doctors but sadly the only I see now doesn&amp;#39;t listen to me at all. For months I have stayed in a bad anxious state where I just know something is really wrong but don&amp;#39;t know what is and can never figure out what it is and the panic attacks have become so severe that I have called the EMTs at least 10 times in a month. Last week I Passed out from a a panic attack and the EMTs that come every single time I call, made me go to the hospital but after Trying on 4 different BP machines including a manual one, my BP stayes so high that none couls get a reading. The hospital is 30 mons away and it wast until halfway there and even at that poont, the bottom number was 133 which is beyond stroke level. Even though I have felt the same feeling for over 16 years, each one is still  terrifying because of how fast my heart rate gets and how high my blood pressure gets. I have barely slept on months because the voice has gotten so loud and so constant that it keeps me awake. If there are any Supernatural fans in here, it feels so much like what Sam went through when Cas broke down the wall in his brain making him go insane from his time in the Cage and he was constantly Hallucinating that Luci was with him st all times, singing or throwing those poppers on the ground all night which caused him to almost doe from lack of sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am honestly not sure why exactly I am posting this but K just got such a strong urge to vent to people who truly understand. My husband is the only person I have who is by my side all all times and doesn&amp;#39;t say rude and hurtful shit like I am just being dramatic and overreacting and I should be a strong enough person to not panic.

New here.

I have a depression and I am autistic (aspergers), and I have recently decided to share my journey with other people. About how I deal with things (or not) and how I am going to deal with things, how I am (going to be) fighting my depression, and maybe in the process of this all, hopefully be able to not just help myself by talking about these things, but also help other people with simillar issues, or even just give them the courage to talk to someone or get help.

My first video of the year I am just explaining some things about me, where I have been and where I want to go.

But I will be creating more video's (not just about these two subjects) about depression and autism.

Hope you guys and girls appreciate what I am trying to do here, and maybe take the time to watch my video and give me some things to talk about, like, what you want ""regular""/healthy people to know and be made aware of, or just say hi to me and to support me on this.

,mentalhealth,"As strange as it sounds I have struggled for the past decade with who I am and what my personality is. 

I have developed social anxiety over the years and I've seen there are mental techniques that help me deal with it (i.e focusing my attention outwards/ or actively changing my thoughts). Over the years I've come across many different techniques/ ways of thinking that make me more able to deal with anxiety and the stresses of life. The issue is whenever I adopt a new technique it feels as though i'm a different person. I feel a distinct difference in myself and my thinking everytime a new technique is used. The change is so noticeable to me that I refer to them as different personalities because of how different I feel and think whenever I shift from one technique to another. 

There are other examples of different techniques that i am using such as: faking confidence, trying to find the humor in things and life, thinking more positively, trying to be more talkative, forcing myself to have more energy, trying to enjoy social situations more, forcing myself to concentrate on the outside world so i dont miss something out, trying to put myself in the shoes of someone else so i can see where they are coming from and there are a few others too that i have experimented on throughout the years. 

​

The change in me feels so strong that even my interests change depending on which technique I use, my skill in certain tasks such as video games (I quite like the video game Fifa and I notice I am far better at it when I use one personality/technique vs when I use another, to the point other people have even stated it's like they're playing against another player, further adding to my belief that each technique is distinct and has it's own strengths and weaknesses. 

My video game online multiplayer record would also change, I could be in one personality/ way of thinking for a few days and notice I am winning a lot of my online games consistently however for one reason or another I would change my thinking technique/ personality and then I can see a noticable difference in how I play. My play style changes and as a result my win/ loss ratio also changes. I would begin to lose many of my online games then. If i wanted to start winning again i would just change the technique my mind is using into one i know which is better at the game. 

This doesn't just happen with online gaming, this effects pretty much every aspect of my life: the shows i am interested in, my hobbies, taste in music, people i am attracted to, career aspirations etc. 

I notice my friendships/ relationships change depending on which personality/ technique I have. For example I could be talking with my brother and see that the personality I am in/ the technique i am using doesnt gel that well worth my brother, so I change my personality to one I know has a better connection with him. In the past i've even categorised which personality works with which person. This became quite confusing though however when I would be in a situation where I would be interacting with multiple people and where i've categorised one person preferring one personality and the other person preffering another. it could get to the point where I would switch my personality mid conversation according to who was talking. As you could imagine, that was extremeley confusing for me and lead to me withdrawing from many many social situations. In all honesty i've become more of a recluse as time has gone on because socialising became such a drain for me to do. 

​

For many years I was jumping from technique to technique or personality to personality but all the confusion and feeling like I wasnt the same person as I was at the start of the day as I was to the end of the day was very difficult to deal with for me. I began having strange fantasies of suicide just so I didn't have to deal with this anymore (just to clarify none of them were serious thoughts, I just thought about them when I was low because that was one way out of this mental pain I was going through). 

​

Anyway so I thought screw it all and screw the techniques, I'm just going to let myself be. I'm just going to let my mind be it's natural self and not try and change it so at least I can feel like the same person day in day out rather than chopping and changing all the time. I wanted to have my relationships mean something and i wanted the accomplishments i have made to feel like i had made them, not some other version of me. 

​

So i kept it as a rule to just let myself be, not change my personality and to try and be myself. When doing this i felt more natural and more like my genuine self. Like i wasn't trying to be something else and i could just let myself be. I've been trying to do this now for the past 4 or 5 years however i've been finding it difficult as I would get really anxious and my mind/ thoughts would get away from me. Without using the techniques the anxiety builds up and i start feeling so low and even paranoid that I feel I just have to change my personality to deal with the stresses of life. I got to the point where i would last around a month or two without shifting or changing the techniques i used/ the personality i am in, but i would get quite down and more and more anxious as time would go on. 

​

This inevitabley lead me to changing my approach/ personality several times just so i could feel calm again. Every time i changed the technique i was in, it feels like pressing a reset button and all the events/ situations that took place in the past personality were meaningless as it was a different ""me"" living through them. 

​

I have struggled to hold a job down becuase i simply cannot decide which personality/ technique to stick with. I believe i preform to an addequate standard when i have a job, however because i keep changing my personality i struggle with any long term commitments. I recently had to leave a well paying job because i simply could not handle the anxiety. 

​

I recently discovered meditation and i like the concept of developing a seperation from your own thoughts/ feelings, that you can just observe them and not get too attached to them. Using this approach/ technique i feel calmer in general and dont wake up feeling sick from my anxious thoughts anymore. However the same issue arises in me, i feel as though it's just another technique. I don't really feel genuine/ natural when using this approach in my day to day life. It's like there is my base self and i have to attach a technique in order to feel okay in my regular day to day activities. I just don't feel natural when using a technique. Another issue is i find it quite draining having a techanique being played in the back of my mind 24/7. I've read the human brain uses about 25% or your bodies resources and i add more pressure onto it by having a constant technique playing in the background as well. 

​

I felt like meditation would have been the answer but it kind of just feels like another technique that although helpful, makes me feel unnatural and disingenious. 

So i often think i can't win if i let myself be and just try and be natural becuase i get anxious stressed easily, but i can't use different techniques because they just make me feel like i am not being my true self. 

​

I know this is a very strange post and i appreciate if you have read it all, my writing style isn't the best and thanks for sticking it out to read it all. The weird thing is i would have wrote this completely differently if i were using a different technique/ in a different personality. 

​

I just want to know if anyone has any advice or if has any knowledge of a feeling like this. I thought this could be linked to a disorder called dissociative identity disorder, previously known as multiple personality disorder, but after seeing around 6 or 7 different therapist/ councellors over the last few years they have ruled this out.

,mentalhealth,"Im currently at my lowest moment as of now. I just had a mental breakdown in front of my teacher and a couple of my friends. They were so nice to calm me down, but i really felt as if everything i did was out of my control.

Basically i went on a fit of rage due to me not being able to get signatures from my teachers for my research papers, i had searched on every nook and cranny of my school only to be told that they were away on an important meeting. At the same time one of the teachers had mention that you need to include one more page naming the teachers that had examined my team at the presentation last sunday. I didn't have that page, while the paper had to be collected today

I don't blame them AT ALL, i knew that i should've finished my research papers a day before it was collected. In which case i could've done small revisions. However my research paper was done on the day it was supposed to be collected, so no window of time was available to us to revise or edit a few things. 

And then IT happened, the stress built up to the point i was unable to handle it, i was absolutely frustrated at myself, the only reason this research paper wasn't going to get a perfect score is due to a few minor mistakes that could've been cleaned up easily a day prior.

I was able to calm myself down, but not in a good way. Basically, in a fit of rage i punched the wall multiple times until i calmed down, i usually do this so the shock of the punch would in some way negate the anger and dissapointment i felt. I know and fully understand that it's unhealthy, but as of now, i really don't know any alternatives.

The teacher later stopped me and told to not hurt yourself, but i just felt like it was somewhat a reminder not to make another stupid mistake.

I really hate this perfectionist motto that somehow im living by. While i am considered an overachiever at school, most of my other friends that are equally if not more intelligent than me never had gone into this state of mania. I just really want to get rid of this THING and i would love advice on how to handle and let go of mistakes.

Because most of the time, when i try to let go, i keep convincing myself that every moment is an opportunity, and its either you don't do it, or you do it with the pretense that failure is not an option.

I really want to become better and especially happier this year, and these last few days weren't any better. I have never been to a psychiatrist so my condition had never been diagnosed. Is it necesarry though? Because i had gone to counseling with my teacher at school.

I dont know if how my friends would accept me now, knowing my ill condition. And especially i dont want to end up hurting anybody else. So im in dire need of advice on how to control oneself

I just had a mental breakdown in front of my teacher and a couple of my friends. They were so nice to calm me down, but i really felt as if everything i did was out of my control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically i went on a fit of rage due to me not being able to get signatures from my teachers for my research papers, i had searched on every nook and cranny of my school only to be told that they were away on an important meeting. At the same time one of the teachers had mention that you need to include one more page naming the teachers that had examined my team at the presentation last sunday. I didn&amp;#39;t have that page, while the paper had to be collected today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t blame them AT ALL, i knew that i should&amp;#39;ve finished my research papers a day before it was collected. In which case i could&amp;#39;ve done small revisions. However my research paper was done on the day it was supposed to be collected, so no window of time was available to us to revise or edit a few things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then IT happened, the stress built up to the point i was unable to handle it, i was absolutely frustrated at myself, the only reason this research paper wasn&amp;#39;t going to get a perfect score is due to a few minor mistakes that could&amp;#39;ve been cleaned up easily a day prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to calm myself down, but not in a good way. Basically, in a fit of rage i punched the wall multiple times until i calmed down, i usually do this so the shock of the punch would in some way negate the anger and dissapointment i felt. I know and fully understand that it&amp;#39;s unhealthy, but as of now, i really don&amp;#39;t know any alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher later stopped me and told to not hurt yourself, but i just felt like it was somewhat a reminder not to make another stupid mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hate this perfectionist motto that somehow im living by. While i am considered an overachiever at school, most of my other friends that are equally if not more intelligent than me never had gone into this state of mania. I just really want to get rid of this THING and i would love advice on how to handle and let go of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because most of the time, when i try to let go, i keep convincing myself that every moment is an opportunity, and its either you don&amp;#39;t do it, or you do it with the pretense that failure is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to become better and especially happier this year, and these last few days weren&amp;#39;t any better. I have never been to a psychiatrist so my condition had never been diagnosed. Is it necesarry though? Because i had gone to counseling with my teacher at school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont know if how my friends would accept me now, knowing my ill condition. And especially i dont want to end up hurting anybody else. So im in dire need of advice on how to control oneself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR, i wanted to turn in my research paper immediately, however do to minor mistakes it wont guarantee a perfect score, this made me go into a state of anger in which i hurt myself just to calm down. However i realize it isn&amp;#39;t healthy and currently affecting my life in school.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Hiya. I'm a woman age 21 and I am really confused. I wrote a lot of context about this issue, because I am having a really hard time with all of this, but if it’s too long to read I totally understand-- I titled the main issue at hand below so you can just skip to there if you would like. No matter how much you read, I really really appreciate it.

*Added a tl;dr at the end for both sections.*

CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT:

I wasn't interested in sex and relationships at all during my childhood and adolescence. When I first learned/ got the ""sex talk"" from my mom around age 8, I was repulsed by sex. It made me feel gross. This feeling, however, is not completely epitomized by the word gross. Thinking about sex made me feel so uncomfortable that I wanted to rip off my own skin. I felt absolutely awful. I never discussed these feelings with my mom, because I couldn't even say the word sex without my whole body cringing. Around this same time I was diagnosed with panic disorder {description of the illness, feel free to skip if you already know: Panic disorder focuses on having panic attacks; panic attacks are often caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain which triggers the fight or flight response when nothing is actually wrong. The main system symptom is extreme fear accompanied by some or all symptoms such as sweating, shaking, feeling dizzy and/or weak, heart/chest pain, as well as an inability to breathe. It is important to distinguish between those who have panic disorder and someone who has experienced one or few panic attacks. Many people may experience a panic attack in their lifetime, or perhaps something more accurately described as an anxiety attack as a panic attack is triggered by no particular reason. These people experience extreme anxiety as a result of a specific reason or incident. To be actually diagnosed with the disorder it has to affect everyday life}. My main triggers as a child were things like vomiting, blood, being in new/uncomfortable situations, and other things like that. I was really lucky in that my mom also has panic disorder so she recognized the signs. Most mental health disorders are diagnosed 8 to 10 years after the first major symptoms appear so I am really happy that my mom could help me with this so I didn't have to go through a super long period being afraid of fear. My mom took me to a therapist to talk about my problems and things began to get better. We established that I had obsessive compulsive tendencies and severe anxiety. After that I didn’t really think about sex and romantic relationships for a while.

At age 17 I was a senior in high school, and for the first time ever I became interested in sex. I began to think about sex more casually and it no longer gave me the ""gross"" feeling that I explained above. In fact, I started to want to have sex. Not in a crazy way, I just become open to the idea of having a relationship, falling in love, and having sex. Now I’m guessing I need to clarify that I like guys and I’m a girl. And to clarify even more I *really* like guys. Not in a boy crazy way, but I obsess over my favorite musicians, actors, and stuff like that. I also like romance dramas and movies. When I meet guys I don’t wanna jump them all or anything like that. I had no experience with guys really at all when I was 17. A guy had asked me out once (well the same guy asked me out three times over three years). The first time I said yes, but then he ignored me for a while and it was weird so I was like “okay I guess this is over.” It kind of just ended like that. The next time he asked me out I was 16 and it was a year later. I hadn’t talked to him in a while and I needed help with something a project and I needed it to be a guy so I asked him and he helped me. I had to drive him home and he turned off the music and started asking me all these serious questions like “how is your life? Are you doing okay now that your parents are divorced?” And other stuff like that. I just gave him some surface level answers and then dropped him off. This is when I felt that “gross” feeling again. I was really uncomfortable and upset. I avoided him and honestly never wanted to talk to him again. It was pretty easy to avoid him so I just kinda let it go saying that I just didn’t like him and then that was it.

After high school I went to a four year college right away. I was hoping to meet a guy, him become my boyfriend, fall in love, have sexy times, all that jazz. I remember trying to convince myself that I had crushes on guys when I didn’t really feel that way because my bitch ex-best friend at the time was super boy crazy and she had a crush on every guy she met. I also think another reason why I was trying so hard to have a crush on a boy was because I really wanted a boyfriend and to start my “sexual journey.” But unfortunately I never really felt that way about a guy so I didn’t really pursue anyone and no one ever pursued me either. My love life was nonexistent. After like 2/2.5 years of college I started to wonder why people even bothered with relationships-- not because I didn’t have a boyfriend and felt bitter though. I honestly just didn’t get it. It seemed like a lot of time to try to get along with someone. I also didn't have any close guy friends so I didn’t really know what it was like to have any kind of relationship with a guy other than my dad, my brother, and some nice coworkers.

Around this time I was having some issues with my mental health again. I regularly see a psychiatrist and take medication for my illnesses (I am very very pro-medication). One doctor visit, my psychiatrist broke the news that he had another diagnosis for me. In addition to the panic disorder, I have Borderline Personality Disorder {description of the illness, feel free to skip if you already know: BPD is a very difficult to diagnose disorder and is considered one of the most extreme and can be very difficult to treat. Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized as experiencing extreme fear of abandonment,  unstable relationships, distorted and often changing view of one’s self, explosive anger, recurring feelings of emptiness, anxiety, and depression.} Long story short this illness sucks so much and sometimes I get so angry that I can’t even think straight.

Anyway, when I started to wonder all these things, I went abroad to study for four months in South Korea and the whole time I was there I was much more occupied with all the great things I was doing so I wasn’t really thinking about boys or sex or that kind of stuff. I had such a great time in Korea! I learned a lot about myself. I realized that my bitch ex-best friend was indeed a bitch that made me hate myself and was super toxic. When I got home I dumped her ass (I actually cried a lot and was super sad. I’m just trying to make myself sound like a cool badass). I missed my brother and sister so much while I was away; I knew that I would because I am super close with both of them, but I was surprised because I actually missed my mom and dad too. My parents are a mess in so many ways, but me being away made them realize how much they depend on me and they started to be more appreciative towards me. I really learned to love myself and for the first time I can remember, despite all the trauma and horribly difficult obstacles I have had to face in my life, I was genuinely happy and I genuinely really liked myself.

THE MAIN ISSUE THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

Now cue the issue I am having that made so much of that happiness, confidence, and comfort go away. The fall 2019 semester (last semester) was the beginning of my last year of college. I was coming back from Korea so I was getting used to going to school in the US and seeing old friends. Two of my closest friends go to school out of state and I wasn’t friends with that bitch ex-best friend anymore so I was hanging out with different people. This is when a friend from a club I was in since the beginning of college reached out to me. (He is important to this story and I will just be referring to him as “Boy” through the rest of this post.) I met up with Boy and we had a great time. We are the same age but he graduated early. Right now he is doing freelance work in the film industry and he has a lot of free time. We started hanging out like once a week and I really enjoyed it.

He confessed to me that during the semester I was gone he got kicked out of our mutual club. I asked him why and he told me that he did something bad to a girl. I already knew Boy was a black-out drunk, but he told me at a party he was black-out drunk and he felt up a girl without her consent. He was clearly super beat-up about it and felt extremely remorseful. Boy is a super liberal guy and really doesn’t seem like the guy to do this sort of thing. Since I wasn’t there when it happened, it was really hard to believe it or even get a grasp on the situation. As someone who has been sexually harassed I before, I felt super conflicted about being his friend, but like I said I wasn’t here when it happened so it seemed pretty unbelievable to me. He told me he was going to group therapy and that he was having a tough time because he hated himself for what he had done.

After a while of hanging out I started to think that I might have a crush on him-- I really think this was because I wanted a boyfriend more than wanted him. I felt super guilty, because of what he had done to that girl, but it was hard to understand. After hanging out a bunch for like 2 months we were at his place watching a movie and he started to cuddle up with me. It was fine and I was telling myself that I liked it and that it something romantic was finally happening. After the movie we ended up in a weird state-- like the vibe was weird. He was being really touchy and kept hugging me awkwardly. At the time I kept telling myself I liked it. Thinking about it now while I’m writing this I feel super uncomfortable.

We hung out again next week and at first things were good as usual. We were going to my place to watch the sequel to the movie we watched last time. As soon as I turned it on he snuggled up against me and suddenly I felt painfully uncomfortable. I started thing things like “I don’t want to do this and I want to be somewhere else.” I told myself that I was just nervous. After I calmed myself down a little I started to get irritated thinking things like “this is boring. I’d rather be watching the show I’m binging right now, and why is he cuddling against me in the traditionally ‘girls position?’ If I could cuddle with a boy I would want to be the one hugging; this is just annoying.” His hair touched my face a bit and it felt course and I was disgusted. He touched my stomach a bit and I felt disgusted. Even though I know that was what I was feeling now, at the time I just brushed it off as being nervous. After watching the movie we were talking about all kinds of stuff. He hangs out with my bitch ex-best friend sometimes and that pisses me off because she did a lot of really horrible things to me and at some point that came up which just pissed me off again.

I’m not the type of person that likes uncertainties and I am also not the type of person who lets a problem be unsolved. I am what you would call a “fixer.” So anyway in one way or another I asked him if he liked me and he said he didn’t know. Well that was kind of annoying but whatever. He asked me too and I also said I didn’t know. Then he asked if he could kiss me and I said yes. I’m kind of ashamed to admit this but I felt like a loser being 21 and never being kissed. I know that I shouldn’t feel bad about it, but the issue still stands. So I really wanted to kiss somones-- or should I say anyone. The kiss was not good. It didn’t feel good. He stuck his pointed tongue on my teeth. It was really not good. After the kiss, I wanted him to leave. I wanted to think by myself about how I felt, but he wanted to talk more. And he basically held me hostage in my own home for a couple hours. It was horrible. Everything he said made me cringe. After he finally left I called my brother and he told me it seemed like I just didn’t like Boy.

For the next week I was seemingly okay, but whenever I thought about the kiss I would violently rub my mouth and have that intense “gross” feeling. I didn't want to think about it anymore, but I thought about it all the time. By the end of the week I was having a full-blown breakdown. I never wanted to see/talk/think about Boy again and I still don’t. He texted me and everything he said was super annoying. I didn’t want to explain to him what was happening so I just told him I was busy and I was going through something. He said texted me annoying stuff like “oh ok...” and “I must have really messed up.” I really don’t like pity parties so it just made my dislike towards him increased. This is really unfortunate because we really were good friends.

It's been about 2 months now and I am still super uncomfortable. When I think about it I get violently upset and I want to aggressively rip the memories out of my brain. I can’t even say these things out loud because it makes me so uncomfortable. Just trying to say “we cuddled” made me so distraught I started to feel painfully uncomfortable and I start to cry in an angry and distressed way. I am so confused and I feel so helpless. My head is constantly swirling with questions like: Are my obsessive compulsive tendencies coming back? I have to wash myself a lot throughout the day, is this related? This is too uncomfortable to just be a dislike of kissing right? Is it just because I don’t like Boy specifically? Is it because I’m not super comfortable with my body (I am overweight and I used to be really insecure but I’m pretty confident these days)? Will I ever be able to have sex? Is it related to my mental health disorders? Or am I possibly some type of asexual, like a gray asexual? Am I alone in all this? Or maybe is this some new mental illness that I need to add to the list of things wrong with my brain? What even is normal? And when will I feel better?

*tl;dr: I have a history of mental illness (Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies, Panic Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder). As a child I was disgusted by sex, but when I turned seventeen I became interested. I went from really hating myself to really liking myself in the past year.*

*tl;dr: I somehow got involved with a friend of mine that is a boy. We kissed and know I have been plagued by this violently “gross” feeling for the past 2 months and continue to feel that way. I hate him because of it and I feel super helpless. I am worried about never being able to have sex and always feeling so violently repulsed.*

I&amp;#39;m a woman age 21 and I am really confused. I wrote a lot of context about this issue, because I am having a really hard time with all of this, but if it’s too long to read I totally understand-- I titled the main issue at hand below so you can just skip to there if you would like. No matter how much you read, I really really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a tl;dr at the end for both sections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t interested in sex and relationships at all during my childhood and adolescence. When I first learned/ got the &amp;quot;sex talk&amp;quot; from my mom around age 8, I was repulsed by sex. It made me feel gross. This feeling, however, is not completely epitomized by the word gross. Thinking about sex made me feel so uncomfortable that I wanted to rip off my own skin. I felt absolutely awful. I never discussed these feelings with my mom, because I couldn&amp;#39;t even say the word sex without my whole body cringing. Around this same time I was diagnosed with panic disorder {description of the illness, feel free to skip if you already know: Panic disorder focuses on having panic attacks; panic attacks are often caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain which triggers the fight or flight response when nothing is actually wrong. The main system symptom is extreme fear accompanied by some or all symptoms such as sweating, shaking, feeling dizzy and/or weak, heart/chest pain, as well as an inability to breathe. It is important to distinguish between those who have panic disorder and someone who has experienced one or few panic attacks. Many people may experience a panic attack in their lifetime, or perhaps something more accurately described as an anxiety attack as a panic attack is triggered by no particular reason. These people experience extreme anxiety as a result of a specific reason or incident. To be actually diagnosed with the disorder it has to affect everyday life}. My main triggers as a child were things like vomiting, blood, being in new/uncomfortable situations, and other things like that. I was really lucky in that my mom also has panic disorder so she recognized the signs. Most mental health disorders are diagnosed 8 to 10 years after the first major symptoms appear so I am really happy that my mom could help me with this so I didn&amp;#39;t have to go through a super long period being afraid of fear. My mom took me to a therapist to talk about my problems and things began to get better. We established that I had obsessive compulsive tendencies and severe anxiety. After that I didn’t really think about sex and romantic relationships for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 17 I was a senior in high school, and for the first time ever I became interested in sex. I began to think about sex more casually and it no longer gave me the &amp;quot;gross&amp;quot; feeling that I explained above. In fact, I started to want to have sex. Not in a crazy way, I just become open to the idea of having a relationship, falling in love, and having sex. Now I’m guessing I need to clarify that I like guys and I’m a girl. And to clarify even more I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like guys. Not in a boy crazy way, but I obsess over my favorite musicians, actors, and stuff like that. I also like romance dramas and movies. When I meet guys I don’t wanna jump them all or anything like that. I had no experience with guys really at all when I was 17. A guy had asked me out once (well the same guy asked me out three times over three years). The first time I said yes, but then he ignored me for a while and it was weird so I was like “okay I guess this is over.” It kind of just ended like that. The next time he asked me out I was 16 and it was a year later. I hadn’t talked to him in a while and I needed help with something a project and I needed it to be a guy so I asked him and he helped me. I had to drive him home and he turned off the music and started asking me all these serious questions like “how is your life? Are you doing okay now that your parents are divorced?” And other stuff like that. I just gave him some surface level answers and then dropped him off. This is when I felt that “gross” feeling again. I was really uncomfortable and upset. I avoided him and honestly never wanted to talk to him again. It was pretty easy to avoid him so I just kinda let it go saying that I just didn’t like him and then that was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After high school I went to a four year college right away. I was hoping to meet a guy, him become my boyfriend, fall in love, have sexy times, all that jazz. I remember trying to convince myself that I had crushes on guys when I didn’t really feel that way because my bitch ex-best friend at the time was super boy crazy and she had a crush on every guy she met. I also think another reason why I was trying so hard to have a crush on a boy was because I really wanted a boyfriend and to start my “sexual journey.” But unfortunately I never really felt that way about a guy so I didn’t really pursue anyone and no one ever pursued me either. My love life was nonexistent. After like 2/2.5 years of college I started to wonder why people even bothered with relationships-- not because I didn’t have a boyfriend and felt bitter though. I honestly just didn’t get it. It seemed like a lot of time to try to get along with someone. I also didn&amp;#39;t have any close guy friends so I didn’t really know what it was like to have any kind of relationship with a guy other than my dad, my brother, and some nice coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time I was having some issues with my mental health again. I regularly see a psychiatrist and take medication for my illnesses (I am very very pro-medication). One doctor visit, my psychiatrist broke the news that he had another diagnosis for me. In addition to the panic disorder, I have Borderline Personality Disorder {description of the illness, feel free to skip if you already know: BPD is a very difficult to diagnose disorder and is considered one of the most extreme and can be very difficult to treat. Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized as experiencing extreme fear of abandonment,  unstable relationships, distorted and often changing view of one’s self, explosive anger, recurring feelings of emptiness, anxiety, and depression.} Long story short this illness sucks so much and sometimes I get so angry that I can’t even think straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when I started to wonder all these things, I went abroad to study for four months in South Korea and the whole time I was there I was much more occupied with all the great things I was doing so I wasn’t really thinking about boys or sex or that kind of stuff. I had such a great time in Korea! I learned a lot about myself. I realized that my bitch ex-best friend was indeed a bitch that made me hate myself and was super toxic. When I got home I dumped her ass (I actually cried a lot and was super sad. I’m just trying to make myself sound like a cool badass). I missed my brother and sister so much while I was away; I knew that I would because I am super close with both of them, but I was surprised because I actually missed my mom and dad too. My parents are a mess in so many ways, but me being away made them realize how much they depend on me and they started to be more appreciative towards me. I really learned to love myself and for the first time I can remember, despite all the trauma and horribly difficult obstacles I have had to face in my life, I was genuinely happy and I genuinely really liked myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE MAIN ISSUE THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now cue the issue I am having that made so much of that happiness, confidence, and comfort go away. The fall 2019 semester (last semester) was the beginning of my last year of college. I was coming back from Korea so I was getting used to going to school in the US and seeing old friends. Two of my closest friends go to school out of state and I wasn’t friends with that bitch ex-best friend anymore so I was hanging out with different people. This is when a friend from a club I was in since the beginning of college reached out to me. (He is important to this story and I will just be referring to him as “Boy” through the rest of this post.) I met up with Boy and we had a great time. We are the same age but he graduated early. Right now he is doing freelance work in the film industry and he has a lot of free time. We started hanging out like once a week and I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He confessed to me that during the semester I was gone he got kicked out of our mutual club. I asked him why and he told me that he did something bad to a girl. I already knew Boy was a black-out drunk, but he told me at a party he was black-out drunk and he felt up a girl without her consent. He was clearly super beat-up about it and felt extremely remorseful. Boy is a super liberal guy and really doesn’t seem like the guy to do this sort of thing. Since I wasn’t there when it happened, it was really hard to believe it or even get a grasp on the situation. As someone who has been sexually harassed I before, I felt super conflicted about being his friend, but like I said I wasn’t here when it happened so it seemed pretty unbelievable to me. He told me he was going to group therapy and that he was having a tough time because he hated himself for what he had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while of hanging out I started to think that I might have a crush on him-- I really think this was because I wanted a boyfriend more than wanted him.

,mentalhealth,"I experienced traumatic experiences as a child and I'm afraid I may be mentally disturbed.

I have a few life experiences I'd like to share.

One of my younger memories of my mother was when I (6 at the time) and my brother (3 at the time) watched as my mother was screaming at my father on the phone as she tried to pull off the locks on our ammunition cabinet. I'm not sure if she was trying to shoot herself or my father. I made my brother go up to her and tell her she was being crazy. She just turned to him and yelled ""Oh yeah? Well you have a crazy mama.""

I used to have big anxiety as a kid, and still a tiny bit now, of when my parents would drive me places and I wouldn't recognize the roads that they were taking me somewhere to kill me, abandon me or drive the car into water to kill us.

I used to be hypersexual as a young child (5-10) because of the stuff I saw on TV. I would often get in trouble at school because I was write or draw sexual things in books.

My father used to beat me and my brother with his belt when we misbehaved. I think he wanted to and liked hurting us. He would say he waited for use to act up so he could hit of on the ass 5, 10 times with his belt.

My father also attempted to murder me (11 or 12 at the time) at a house party we were having when somebody ate his plate of food he has hiding in the microwave. He said he was going to shoot every last motherfucker there until he found out who did it. His friends had to drag him away from the ammo cabinet and gun safe. I grabbed my younger cousin and hid I my mom's car with a pair of scissors while it happened.

In 2nd grade I tried to commit suicide. I've been morbidly obese my entire life and was dehumanized at school daily. I wrote a suicide note that my parents accidentally found. I tried so, so hard to hit my head as hard as possible on the cinderblock walls of my school with the intention of dying, not knowing that that wouldn't kill me. I used to jump off the top of my playground equipment too, and fall without catching myself, just like how it felt when I would collapse on the floor and hit my head. I did it over and over again. I was 9.

Jump to 7th-9th grade. I began cutting my wrists. I became addicted. I then later had sexual responses from it. I now have very scary and violent, dangerous fetishes and sexual intrests.

In 10th grade I tried to kill myself again.

I was incredibly depressed my Jr year, too. But no suicide attempt. I would cry myself to sleep, almost manic, nearly screaming because I was terrified that I was insane because of the thoughts on my brain.

That's all I will like to share, if you would like to know more, ask.

Now, present day I'm scared I may be mentally disturbed as I take pleasure in violent porn and have murderous fantasies that I take sexual pleasure in.

I feel like a creep when I think about people. I feel something wrong in me, like if my brain were a clock it would be ticking differently than other people. It's hard for me to feel love for other people or animals. I struggle with food addiction too but have stopped cutting for a long time. 

A week ago my doctor suggested to my mother that I see a therapist because I seemed depressed (just diagnosed with an autoimmune disease). When I was first diagnosed I thought about killing myself more than I already do. It was all I could think about.

&lt;p&gt;I feel like a creep when I think about people. I feel something wrong in me, like if my brain were a clock it would be ticking differently than other people. It&amp;#39;s hard for me to feel love for other people or animals. I struggle with food addiction too but have stopped cutting for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week ago my doctor suggested to my mother that I see a therapist because I seemed depressed (just diagnosed with an autoimmune disease). When I was first diagnosed I thought about killing myself more than I already do. It was all I could think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to cry, and I want to feel normal but nothing inside of me feels normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need advice or just some guidance on this I’m not sure if this is normal (for this situation) or if it’s something else/more I should or need to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"I've dealt with depression for pretty much as long as I can remember, but I've been able to shrug it off most of the time and live life fairly normally. About a year ago I went vegan and starting losing weight, finally escaping my lifetime obesity. I thought all my problems existed due to me being fat, and that if I could be skinny I would be successful in everything I tried. Obviously that was disillusion, but I never ever imagined that my confidence and social skills would seemingly shed off with the pounds.

I've always definitely been a quirky person, obsessed with niche music and not much else. I've always had a natural talent for music but as a person with very low self-worth, other musicians with their own fragile egos have often seen me as a target, and I've developed trust issues an a feeling of nihilism towards my passion. When I talk to people I feel like the only thing I have to talk about is music, and I end up getting frustrated in most conversations about the topic, a recipe for social failure.

After a toxic first serious relationship and an even more toxic rebound, I decided to give up on relationships. I didn't want to be hurt anymore, but moreso I didn't want to sacrifice my own personality to better suit someone else's romantic desires. Most relationships I see appear to be full of conflict and I have no interest. I came out as asexual even though I still have the desire to have sex simply because I am repulsed by how open people are about it. Before my first serious relationship got too toxic we had an okay sex life, but I still found it to be quite overrated, and I felt like the fantasies I had developed from watching porn were not nearly as satisfying in real life. I recently went NoFap and quit porn, which has helped me feel more attracted to people, but I don't feel like I have the social skills or energy to flirt and pursue. I want to find someone who's life isn't purely about sex and relationships, and don't expect their partner to change drastically for them, but I feel more and more like this doesn't even exist. Even if it does, how would even I be able to pull myself together socially to get together with that person in the first place?

I am planning to spend my final year at university abroad in order to reinvigorate my social skills, and find enjoyment in sex/relationships again, but as the application deadline gets closer I feel more and more like I'm just running away and I don't really have any business going. Additionally, Japan is where I am trying to go. I am learning the language but its a very slow and frustrating process, but regardless, if I can't even talk to people in English how the fuck am I supposed to be able to talk to people in Japanese?

I guess I'm just lost. I have no motivation besides to finish my degree. I'm so lonely and I just want someone to put their hands through my hair and tell me it will be okay. I don't want to feel ugly anymore, I don't want to feel like a bad musician anymore. I don't want to feel like I have to run away but I also don't see what's left for me where I'm currently at. I don't want to feel like everyone is more savvy and clever than me in conversations. I don't want to feel like the least entitled person to happiness but everyone I've ever cared about has led me to believe that. I want to make new friends that I won't drift away from or won't say terrible things to me.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always definitely been a quirky person, obsessed with niche music and not much else. I&amp;#39;ve always had a natural talent for music but as a person with very low self-worth, other musicians with their own fragile egos have often seen me as a target, and I&amp;#39;ve developed trust issues an a feeling of nihilism towards my passion. When I talk to people I feel like the only thing I have to talk about is music, and I end up getting frustrated in most conversations about the topic, a recipe for social failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a toxic first serious relationship and an even more toxic rebound, I decided to give up on relationships. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be hurt anymore, but moreso I didn&amp;#39;t want to sacrifice my own personality to better suit someone else&amp;#39;s romantic desires. Most relationships I see appear to be full of conflict and I have no interest. I came out as asexual even though I still have the desire to have sex simply because I am repulsed by how open people are about it. Before my first serious relationship got too toxic we had an okay sex life, but I still found it to be quite overrated, and I felt like the fantasies I had developed from watching porn were not nearly as satisfying in real life. I recently went NoFap and quit porn, which has helped me feel more attracted to people, but I don&amp;#39;t feel like I have the social skills or energy to flirt and pursue. I want to find someone who&amp;#39;s life isn&amp;#39;t purely about sex and relationships, and don&amp;#39;t expect their partner to change drastically for them, but I feel more and more like this doesn&amp;#39;t even exist. Even if it does, how would even I be able to pull myself together socially to get together with that person in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning to spend my final year at university abroad in order to reinvigorate my social skills, and find enjoyment in sex/relationships again, but as the application deadline gets closer I feel more and more like I&amp;#39;m just running away and I don&amp;#39;t really have any business going. Additionally, Japan is where I am trying to go. I am learning the language but its a very slow and frustrating process, but regardless, if I can&amp;#39;t even talk to people in English how the fuck am I supposed to be able to talk to people in Japanese?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;m just lost. I have no motivation besides to finish my degree. I&amp;#39;m so lonely and I just want someone to put their hands through my hair and tell me it will be okay. I don&amp;#39;t want to feel ugly anymore, I don&amp;#39;t want to feel like a bad musician anymore. I don&amp;#39;t want to feel like I have to run away but I also don&amp;#39;t see what&amp;#39;s left for me where I&amp;#39;m currently at. I don&amp;#39;t want to feel like everyone is more savvy and clever than me in conversations. I don&amp;#39;t want to feel like the least entitled person to happiness but everyone I&amp;#39;ve ever cared about has led me to believe that. I want to make new friends that I won&amp;#39;t drift away from or won&amp;#39;t say terrible things to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t know where to go from here and any insight is appreciated. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"I have trouble reading mathematical proofs in papers. Noticed recently (started grad school). I am fine with formulas sprinkled in the main body of computer science and related papers (and rest of the text in the paper), however, I struggle with the appendix parts where there are often multi-page proofs.

It is better if I have smth to write on (a piece of paper or a touchscreen) to follow derivations myself, but that takes significantly more time (quick note: my writing is fine.

My reading comprehension is pretty good unless the text falls into the above-mentioned type.

So, my struggle with reading might be caused by the lack of practice - I didn't need to read many proofs in cs and engineering classes during undergrad since I understood most things intuitively, and frankly, they were far simpler (and shorter).

&lt;p&gt;So, my struggle with reading might be caused by the lack of practice - I didn&amp;#39;t need to read many proofs in cs and engineering classes during undergrad since I understood most things intuitively, and frankly, they were far simpler (and shorter). Worked at Big N after undergrad, but didn&amp;#39;t get much experience in this regard there either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to hear if you&amp;#39;ve experienced something similar as if they were linked to mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"I posted some of this on another sub for something else but is basically an example of what I mean; 

 My boyfriends license was suspended so he cant drive to work. I work on campus which is where he works. He asked me if I would be able to pick him up and drop him off because he lives on the way, but it is about 15 -25 mins extra.

It wouldnt be a big deal and I would do it BUT....I have severe anxiety and last year I got in 2 accidents (not at fault) and since ive been scared to drive and developed a tick where I squint my eyes tight/long and tense/strain my neck/shoulder muscles, so I am also constantly in pain from tensing it when it gets bad. and triggered by stress/driving which is unsafe and dont drive when its bad, however most of the time I am okay but just stressed and have painful tension, but is not affecting my driving, but i only drive what i need to...extra time is just more time being in pain and stressed. 

I go to class/work on campus which is 45 minutes away. I only drive when I have to. I see doctors and say its caused by stress and have tried things to help, they say I can drive unless I feel it is very bad and going to affect my driving (which sometimes it will so I choose not to drive that day/call out of work) so i do not put others on the road in danger. He understood but yesterday he called asking me to drive him and i told him i cant and he says ""It's only 5 mins out of your way not a big deal"" I told him imagine only being able to hold your breath for 3 mins and then say you needa do it 5 mins longer, you CANT. This is how I feel to drive. It goes away when I dont drive for abit.

He tells me that he told people and he said that they said what im doing is fucked up, when of course, he didn't tell them my situation other than just ""not feeling like it"". With that being said, he did this to himself and refuses to take responsibility! he got his license revoked, multiple tickets/accidents/car stolen, why should i pay for his mistakes?

So he ends up ubering to me so I could drop him off at campus next day and said I didnt need to go to his work, just park. I agree even though he wanted me to pick him up to begin with to avoid taking uber twice which he did anyways. We leave and he starts asking why I am mad and I said im upset how he acted towards me. We get there and he starts going off on me how im selfish, told me he would never do anything for me, drive me anywhere again (which he did only few times forever ago) and says how 5 mins isnt a big deal. I start crying because I feel I am constantly told it's not a big deal when im in physical pain and anxious constantly. I told him he doesnt understand which is okay, but he says he does. We park and he says ""great now I have to walk for 2 hours to get to work"" WHEN HE TOLD ME i just needed to park and he will get to his work and made me feel like shit, so I drive him to his work which was 7ish minutes away but took me 15 to get back (I hit all the lights and there was traffic on that side) and was 1 min away from being late to work. He didnt thank me just said that hed never do anything for me again and that i made this difficult for no reason, im selfish and its my fault bc I wont ""fix it"" (my twitch/anxiety). I do feel bad, at the same time I cant change it.   


I am constantly working with doctors and doing what they advice, trying new medications/new methods to combat this and help myself but it takes time and have monthly if not more appointments to try a new medication or something else and to talk about things whatever it may be. But he keeps telling me that I'm not trying because its not ""fixed"" and keeps thinking my issues are not a big deal and that im just being dramatic. And I honestly feel awful because I constantly feel I'm not being believed....that my issues are just made up and exaggerated, that it doesnt affect me ""that much"" But then in other times he will say how understanding and supportive he is of me and always seems geniuine in times  I need it, but as soon as my issues are affecting him all hell breaks lose and he tells me he still understands, but it suddenly is not a big issue and im exaggerating. It's starting to make me feel I am exaggerating and that it isn't a big deal and that its just all in my head and i dont know how to feel anymore because i cant control any of this at all so how can i be exaggerating? i dont know anymore but i just feel so helpless and that everything is  just in my head and im just an awful person/gf and just blame myself.

&gt;Although it’s still a rather taboo subject.. many of us suffer from mental illness. The problem lies in the stigma surrounding it, and many don’t like being put in a categorical box.

&lt;p&gt;Although it’s still a rather taboo subject.. many of us suffer from mental illness. The problem lies in the stigma surrounding it, and many don’t like being put in a categorical box.  &lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"Thank you to the moderators of /r/MentalHealth for allowing me to post here!

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non- invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires, two neuroimaging sessions, and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS.
Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

If you are interested, please contact Young at 646-774-7603, or at young.cho@nyspi.columbia.edu. More information is also available at https://tdcsresearch.wordpress.com/. It is better to reach out to us directly through these channels rather than sending me a message here.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

Some details about confidentiality and the use of your personal information:

If you consent to participate in this research, your personal information will be kept confidential and will not be released without your written permission except as described in this section or as required by law. Your name or other identifying information will not be made known if the results of this study are published for scientific purposes.

To make your personal research results not be identifiable with you if they are used for publication in the scientific literature and presentation at scientific meetings, we will remove all your identifying information, including name and date of birth.
Scan results, questionnaire answers, and data collected during the task may be used in future studies, and if shared with other investigators, information that identifies the scan, questionnaire responses, or task data with you will be removed before hand. There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality from such data sharing, but this is extremely low as only de-identified data from this study may be shared.

Clinical records, including your name and other personal identifying information, and research data will be kept in secure storage at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Information in paper format will be kept in locked files. Electronic data, including MRI images, will be protected by a firewall (programming that makes it virtually impossible to access the data from outside the New York State Psychiatric Institute) and by restricting access within the New York State Psychiatric Institute through use of a password known only to authorized personnel. If information is transmitted electronically, it will be encrypted so that your identifying information remains confidential.

Records will be available to research staff, and to Federal, State, and Institutional regulatory personnel (who may review records as part of routine audits). Your information will also be available to other authorized individuals, including those at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. There are also legal advocacy organizations that have the authority under New York State law to have access to otherwise confidential subject records, although they cannot disclose this information without your consent.

Your MRI will be interpreted and the results will be shared with you or a physician who you may designate.

,mentalhealth,"Alrighty lemme get started, some things to clear up for background info, this is my first reddit post so im really new here! I just feel like i needed advice from somebody else because i have nobody to talk to except 1 person(ill get into it later), to start things off im 17 years old and i love to be outgoing for people no matter what cause i love helping other whenever/however i can and i love to make people laugh even tho it can get me in touble, im more of the class clown. When i was born my mom noticed i didnt behave normally (shes an occupational therapist) so i was taken to the doctors and diagnosed with high-functioning autism at a very young age (also im sorry if i skip around a lot i have a tendency to do that lol) my mother has always been so outgoing for me and has been there for me. And ive always been the person to overthink a lot and i  get extreme anxiety often, so ive had a very antisocial life up until highschool when i started to break my chains finally, but up until now. Recently i feel like everything has been going downhill, first im super worried about what im going to do about life after i graduate, and when i got a job in the past summer it was very stressful because the coworkers would think im weird and think im rude by not following instructions even though its only cause i had a hard time processing things (to an average person it seems like nothing is wrong with me) and i feel like ill never be able to secure a good job and keep it without getting fired. And when school started i quit when things started getting really busy. So when my seinor year i was so happy to be just relaxed but now the past month has been nothing but doubt, mostly because when i see everything i do i always think its not good enough and i could do better but am never been able to achieve it. For example i LOVE to play music as a hobby and have been playing cello since i was 5 and have grown to play many instruments like piano, guitar, drums, ukulele, and i also sing. And at home i have a mini recording studio that i use to record myself playing and edit which i taught myself to do but as of recently whenever i record and start editing all i can do is point out the mistakes i make and can never get it to be perfect by myself even though ive watched countless youtube videos to teach myself all i can but still with that i am always finding mistakes i make and end up almost crying cause i want to be good and when i listen to my favorite bands i want to be like them but never can achieve it. I want to come out with my own little album for the fun of it but i feel like people will think it sounds bad cause it's not probably. I want to talk to my friends about it but they dont know how to talk about things like this.

I just feel like i needed advice from somebody else because i have nobody to talk to except 1 person(ill get into it later), to start things off im 17 years old and i love to be outgoing for people no matter what cause i love helping other whenever/however i can and i love to make people laugh even tho it can get me in touble, im more of the class clown. When i was born my mom noticed i didnt behave normally (shes an occupational therapist) so i was taken to the doctors and diagnosed with high-functioning autism at a very young age (also im sorry if i skip around a lot i have a tendency to do that lol) my mother has always been so outgoing for me and has been there for me. And ive always been the person to overthink a lot and i  get extreme anxiety often, so ive had a very antisocial life up until highschool when i started to break my chains finally, but up until now. Recently i feel like everything has been going downhill, first im super worried about what im going to do about life after i graduate, and when i got a job in the past summer it was very stressful because the coworkers would think im weird and think im rude by not following instructions even though its only cause i had a hard time processing things (to an average person it seems like nothing is wrong with me) and i feel like ill never be able to secure a good job and keep it without getting fired. And when school started i quit when things started getting really busy. So when my seinor year i was so happy to be just relaxed but now the past month has been nothing but doubt, mostly because when i see everything i do i always think its not good enough and i could do better but am never been able to achieve it. For example i LOVE to play music as a hobby and have been playing cello since i was 5 and have grown to play many instruments like piano, guitar, drums, ukulele, and i also sing. And at home i have a mini recording studio that i use to record myself playing and edit which i taught myself to do but as of recently whenever i record and start editing all i can do is point out the mistakes i make and can never get it to be perfect by myself even though ive watched countless youtube videos to teach myself all i can but still with that i am always finding mistakes i make and end up almost crying cause i want to be good and when i listen to my favorite bands i want to be like them but never can achieve it. I want to come out with my own little album for the fun of it but i feel like people will think it sounds bad cause it&amp;#39;s not probably. I want to talk to my friends about it but they dont know how to talk about things like this. And i do have a therapist that i see every 2 weeks but i dont feel like he really knows whats going on inside my head, and same goes with my mom but she understands me a lot more yet she is super stressed out as of recently and i dont want to bother her, so all of this has been making me just be really quiet and more anti-social than usual and i feel like crying all the time and just dont wanna get out of bed and wanna be in the shadows all the time even tho all i want is a shoulder to cry on.

,mentalhealth,"My younger brother (by 1 year), who I’ll call Joe, is suffering from depression. He aspires to be a highly successful executive in the business or finance sector, which he would be able to achieve with his high intellectual ability, his personality, and with an economics degree that he has been working towards....on and off. However, he has had to resit his first year multiple times and is currently on a break from university (in the UK we call it uni and that’s what I’ll be using from now on) after being told that he can’t resit a couple exams he failed till this summer, as opposed to last summer when he had expected to resit them. Before that happened he had mostly been doing really well, getting many 2:1s and firsts (the two best grades) in most of his exams and courseworks. But since the news about the whole year of delay he has been relapsing into his previous self-destructive behaviour, which isn’t even that bad but involves a heavy amount of League of Legends, which he is highly addicted to when in a negative mindset. He told me today that he now uses it as his way to socialise because he alienated many friends after a drunken night out; he said that if it weren’t for that he would go crazy. He also told me today that he has, a few times now, considered taking all of the painkillers in the house and consuming them all in one. Since he has a few times denounced suicide as an illogical and stupid thing that people can do (an opinion I disapprove of), this came as a shock.

We both still live with our parents because he’s an on/off student and I recently got my masters degree and am looking for jobs, but our parents are not supportive towards him so he only really has me. Neither of us have ever been able to rely on our parents to help us out with any social or mental issues we were having, and my mum in fact has a negative effect on his mindset and behaviour (and mine, when I was depressed, but I’m ok now). She means well. She is enthusiastic about bringing up two children who have the capacity and education (both privately educated and I have that masters) to go far in life, but she is not your typical nurturing mother. She doesn’t understand us, especially my brother. She came from a different culture - she moved to the UK from China when she was around my age (23-25); Chinese culture is not known for its emphasis on human psychology, instead being very focussed on academic success and the subsequent monetary rewards. Since living in the UK for 30+ years and working as a nurse, she has some understanding of mental health and how we deal with it in this country (and the Western world in general), but not enough to help my brother. Every time she sees him on that game; every time she catches him in bed past 11am; every time my brother neglects to make progress in uni or the degree apprenticeship applications that we’ve all recently agreed would be a realistic alternative to uni, she will get really pissed off and say something negative about his behaviour. He tells me that he is already feeling like shit for being like that, but her being all negative like that just makes him feel worse. And that’s so obvious to me, but my mum won’t fucking get it even though I’ve told her time after time to try and be positive towards him. I can’t blame this on my mother; Joe doesn’t want to either. But the fact is that we don’t live in a nurturing environment where we can effectively grow as people.

My own personal development came from uni, with influence from my uni friends. As a woman it’s different because I can be vulnerable in front of my friends and it’s not as much of a big deal (still really don’t like it though). But as a man who realises the negative effect of our culture of toxic masculinity has on him, yet still can’t shake his traditional masculine ideals, he can’t stand to be in a dark situation in front his friends. So he has avoided social situations altogether, with only us family members and his work colleagues (he has a part-time job as a housekeeper) as people to talk to in person. I told him that his mentality of not getting help contributes to suicide rates, of which there is a higher trend amongst men across the globe. He agrees. But he can’t help it. It’s hard to think positive when your mind is that deep in a black hole.

Today I insisted that he get therapy, which I’ve mentioned in the past but not with as much emphasis as today. He doesn’t enjoy the idea of therapy because he saw some sort of counsellor at uni for some time and he says it didn’t help at all. But I told him that he could see a psychotherapist or clinical psychologist with years of experience, a PhD and specialist knowledge in his sort of situation/issue. He says he will see one next week. But to me, a week is a long time. We have a family history of depression too; my granddad committed suicide when my dad was 12; my dad himself has suffered depressive episodes (which improved with therapy!) and my uncle is highly unstable. I believe we are genetically predisposed towards suicidal thoughts. I had suicidal thoughts when I was a teen. I hate to hear that my brother has the same currently.

Do I have to do a TL;DR for a fucking mental health subreddit? Surely not but I will anyway cos I cba to check.

I am super bad at decision-making. And i hate it.

I think that one of my main weaknesses has always been the absence of experience in some key aspects of life, especially relationships. I never had a girlfriend. I am not bad-looking, but very insecure when dealing with girls in a romantic way (mainly because of the aforementioned lack of experience). I would even go as far to say that my behavior may sometimes be considered asexual - even though I am not. Furthermore, the situation I am in right now (and who knows, perhaps also in the future) does not allow me to meet new people that easily, especially girls (I study computer engineering so yeah... lol).

I feel like this lack of experience also influences other aspects of my life. I don't feel on par with most of the people my age. I feel a not-so-much adult in an adult world, alienated, left behind. This vicious cycle will eventually get worse and worse, as people go on with their life while things will get harder and harder for me to turn around.

That said, I tried to change things - perhaps not hard enough. I asked out a girl I barely knew via DM, she eventually said yes. This was my first date of my life. It went well, or at least it seemed to me, we laughed a lot and I personally had fun. But then she said she was not interested when I asked for a second date a few days later. Thing is, she is literally the only one I could have asked out that I somewhat know. This was one month ago.

And now I am in one of those periods in my life where I feel like this is not going anywhere. I hope it's not true, but it's been like this for all these years. The hypothesis that this may be my life until the end gets more and more realistic as time goes on.

I went to therapy for most of my life - from when I was a child up until 2 years ago, when I was 21. I never had the courage to state that never having been in a relationship was a problem for me. It was something I was ashamed to express my desire of. In general, I never managed to talk freely about my problems there because of this.

I quit therapy after realizing that, after all these years, I was not happy with my life. I agree that it sounds simplistic, but I also wanted to try and live without it and see how I would fare. I still am on my meds though (prescribed from a doctor).

I would love to hear some valuable, intelligent advice on one or more topics I've talked about in this post.

I didn’t know who to turn to so here I am. Okay so I come from a pakistani muslim family. about two years I started dating another muslim guy but he is another sect.

And I still don’t know if she actually wants to change herself (which didn’t occur) or if she just plays the victim or whether I am ungrateful. I love her and I would just like to see things clearer &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope someone could tell me how these things look like from a different perspective and maybe could give me some advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot
(Please excuse any grammar mistakes etc. and I never done anything like this before so idk how this is actually working :D )&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"I was trying to get some sleep for 3 hours, but instead i found myself thinking what i would write to my suicide note . I haven't tried seeking help at all or talking about my problems that much, but now i realized, that it's the only thing left to do.

I turned 21 recently and i feel like my life has nothing left to offer.

My world is getting darker everysingle day for unknown reason.

I dont live my life for my own sake, but for my closest friends which i consider my family. I made a promise to one of my friends, that i wouldn't consider suicide as an option a while back, but if nothing changes soon there is no doubt that i would break it eventually.

I think i've been depressed since 2014, but the past year it has made my life a living hell.

I can't get out of bed, answer phone, brush my teeth or get a shower and if i manage to do one of those things, i can say it was a good one.

In 2015 i got diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis. I was unable to move out of bed for several months, and even moving my hand made my whole body crumble from pain

( I dont remember much from this year or from the hospitalization when the ankylosing spondylitis hit me )

I didn't think alot of it back then but it must have had an insane impact on my mental health without me even realizing it.

I found happiness again somehow for a solid 8 months back in 2018 when i started lifting and going to gym almost everyday. I finally had found something to do with my life that i actually enjoyed alot. I was happy that i was making alot of progress and at the end of december 2018 i injured my shoulder, and to this day im unable to go back to gym and get back into lifting because my shoulder hurts so bad that i can't lift even a coffee cup without getting pain flowing into my arm.

After my shoulder injury, i was in a dark place. I was still finishing studies and taking a final mandatory classes to get out of the miserable school i was in. For somereason i asked if i could swap seats to sit next to a girl who was sitting alone by the time. She was really good at this subject, and would teach me, since i was terrible at it. I ended up asking her out and the next thing i know, we are hanging out everyday. Me being me , i got my feelings involved more than i should after like 1 to 2 months of doing things together, but not "" dating "" , we were just randomly having sex and chilling at our places binge watching shows.

But for me, all the good things come to an end quickly for some odd reason.

This was my 2nd time where i found something good in my life to lose it after being in really REALLY dark place.

I realized that nothing good ever lasts longer than a while for me.

I dont know how many times i can fall down and get up.

Im getting more and more tired.

I recently started "" losing time "" where i might say something and forget what i said after 1 minute and say it again.

Everyday is the same and many days are all blending into one day

I can't sleep or i sleep too much.

I haven't been able to cry in years and i miss it more than anything in this world, I WISH I COULD CRY!!!

In the beginning of 2018 i lost the ability to feel any emotions ( other than anger and irritation ) at all for many months, and i thought wow , this is good since im not sad anymore, but the days went by and i realized feeling nothing was worse than being sad. I was lost, but later this year i found my emotions again, to find them only being 10 times stronger.

feeling sadness 10x the normal amount isn't really maintainable, but when it gets to that point, my emotions just randomly shut off.

I also feel like with depression and anxiety im losing my intelligence day by day.

It gets harder to think and speak. My thoughts are slow and i can't focus at anything, also remembering even the most basic stuff is getting challenging.

When meeting new people, you get asked THE QUESTION "" What are your future plans? ""

You need to lie everytime to everysingle new person you talk to. In what world would you just say, that you see yourself dead in 2 years ? No, you will just make something up and tell them what they want to hear. Its getting really troublesome and boring.

I started cutting myself to feel better few months ago, it has been the only thing beside music to keep me going for now.

Im going to try and be brave and get help before it's too late for the sake of people i care about , for the first time in my life.

&lt;p&gt;In 2015 i got diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis. I was unable to move out of bed for several months, and even moving my hand made my whole body crumble from pain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;( I dont remember much from this year or from the hospitalization when the ankylosing spondylitis hit me )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think alot of it back then but it must have had an insane impact on my mental health without me even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found happiness again somehow for a solid 8 months back in 2018 when i started lifting and going to gym almost everyday. I finally had found something to do with my life that i actually enjoyed alot. I was happy that i was making alot of progress and at the end of december 2018 i injured my shoulder, and to this day im unable to go back to gym and get back into lifting because my shoulder hurts so bad that i can&amp;#39;t lift even a coffee cup without getting pain flowing into my arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my shoulder injury, i was in a dark place. I was still finishing studies and taking a final mandatory classes to get out of the miserable school i was in. For somereason i asked if i could swap seats to sit next to a girl who was sitting alone by the time. She was really good at this subject, and would teach me, since i was terrible at it. I ended up asking her out and the next thing i know, we are hanging out everyday. Me being me , i got my feelings involved more than i should after like 1 to 2 months of doing things together, but not &amp;quot; dating &amp;quot; , we were just randomly having sex and chilling at our places binge watching shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me, all the good things come to an end quickly for some odd reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my 2nd time where i found something good in my life to lose it after being in really REALLY dark place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that nothing good ever lasts longer than a while for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont know how many times i can fall down and get up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im getting more and more tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently started &amp;quot; losing time &amp;quot; where i might say something and forget what i said after 1 minute and say it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday is the same and many days are all blending into one day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t sleep or i sleep too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been able to cry in years and i miss it more than anything in this world, I WISH I COULD CRY!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of 2018 i lost the ability to feel any emotions ( other than anger and irritation ) at all for many months, and i thought wow , this is good since im not sad anymore, but the days went by and i realized feeling nothing was worse than being sad. I was lost, but later this year i found my emotions again, to find them only being 10 times stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;feeling sadness 10x the normal amount isn&amp;#39;t really maintainable, but when it gets to that point, my emotions just randomly shut off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel like with depression and anxiety im losing my intelligence day by day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets harder to think and speak. My thoughts are slow and i can&amp;#39;t focus at anything, also remembering even the most basic stuff is getting challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When meeting new people, you get asked THE QUESTION &amp;quot; What are your future plans? &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to lie everytime to everysingle new person you talk to. In what world would you just say, that you see yourself dead in 2 years ? No, you will just make something up and tell them what they want to hear. Its getting really troublesome and boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started cutting myself to feel better few months ago, it has been the only thing beside music to keep me going for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im going to try and be brave and get help before it&amp;#39;s too late for the sake of people i care about , for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like nothing is fixable, but hey you can&amp;#39;t know before you try!&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"I am 17 and I've noticed a trend in my emotional states. It's not like I'm not happy at any given moment, but even when I am happy, deep inside, I feel dull. Even as I'm writing this, I just feel this horrible feeling inside of me that makes me want to stop and just stuff my head into a pillow and cry. And to make things worse ... I really don't know why I feel like this.

I have some friends. Most of them are not really what you would call close, but I can say that I have atleast one friend who listens to my problems. He's a good guy but he's a jock and the only thing he suggests for me is to play sports, but I've tried and it doesn't help. Punching walls when I'm angry doesn't do much better, but the pain serves as a distraction.

For some more context: I'm easily irritated. That's an understatement.
**Anything can tick me off when I'm in my sad phase**

I've not always been like this. My affinity to irritation has often led to me making some sharp remarks when I'm talking with said friends. But I feel so helpless. They think I can be very rude at times and on one occasion, I made one of my friends cry. I swear I wanted to sit right next to them and cry with them. *But I cannot.*

Jeez, I'm only 17 and I live a happy life compared to so many other people in the world. I think it's ironic for me to be this sad. 

My parents have always been prone to getting in fights with each other for the smallest things. My dad has anger issues and has broken many a pieces of furniture in his rage. I'm not comfortable talking to him till this day. 
My mother is better; I can talk to her a little more freely. She has been taking medication for depression for over 5 year now and has anger issues similar to my dad's. She'll throw her smartphone in anger and she'll stop talking to me if I ever take my dad's side in an argument. Basically, she believes she has the moral high ground in everything.
Needless to say, their marriage is not going great, but they are both hesitant to divorce. That does not mean they don't blackmail each other using divorce, which really hurts my mental well-being.

I also have a younger brother, who is 10 years old. Despite the seven year age gap, I CANNOT STAND HIM. He's a disrespectful brat who has learnt to manipulate my parents to buy him whatever he wants and he has no respect for my personal items. He won't listen to a SINGLE thing I ever ask of him and always acts entitled. But enough about him. I can't change him. I don't have the willpower.

On another note, I can sleep for hours on end and can stay away well past bedtime. Not something I'm proud of but I thought you should know.

My face is always dull and I frequently get remarks at school asking why I am always sad looking. It's just so much harder for me to show any emotions. One last thing is that, I find it difficult to cry. I think it's because I'm conditioned to suppress any sadness at home.

I rarely have any alone time and I don't have a room of my own. I share a room with my brother. My bed is a bunk bed and I have the upper bunk. That, perhaps, is the only place during the day when I can feel alone and by my thoughts. Otherwise I'm always in the eyes of people. I am typing this laying in my bed. 

If you need any more details, please comment. I just want to know if I am just your everyday sad teen or do I have depression. I am not karmawhoring. Please help me out, I will be really grateful.

,mentalhealth,"Women, if you are in a sexually-active romantic relationship, please participate in a brief survey! 

Researchers at Western Carolina University are inviting women, whether or not you have had past unwanted sexual experiences, to participate. This study investigates how past unwanted sexual experiences and discussions of those experiences with one’s romantic partner may be associated with women’s sex lives.

To participate, you must be:

·  A woman

·  18 years or older

·  In a romantic relationship

·  Have had sex with your partner in the past four weeks

The goal of this study is to better understand women’s sexual experiences in romantic relationships. You will be asked very personal questions about your sex life, personality, and romantic relationship. If you have had unwanted sexual experiences in your past, you will also be asked a few very brief questions about those experiences. 

This study will take approximately 15 minutes to complete

If you have had unwanted sexual experiences in your past, you will also be asked a few very brief questions about those experiences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study will take approximately 15 minutes to complete&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your responses are&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;completely anonymous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. This study does not collect any identifying information.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"To say I'm concerned is an understatement. My sister is at university and she won't go to the cafeteria to eat, go to class, or really do much outside of her room because she has several social anxiety. I've told her to go to see the school's mental health office, but she does not listen. 

She's been on probation before so I'm afraid that she will be expelled soon or just drop out. I know that she wants to graduate...she's just not going to class which means that she's failing her classes. 

She also has a history of depression &amp; suicidal tendencies. She used to go to a therapist when she was younger but was pulled out because our parents did not want to medicate her and she seemed to do a bit better but for the last few years she's been spiraling back down.

At this point, it's also impacting me because instead of focusing on my classes I'm just worrying about her and stressing out because she's missing lecture. It got to a point earlier this week where I was on the brink of an anxiety attack myself in the middle of the library because I was just so worried about her.

,mentalhealth,"Hi everyone. Not sure if this is the right forum to post this, so feel free to redirect me to the right one.  I grew up very privileged,  in a nice house, and lived comfortably. My mom is a single mom and has an executive-level well paying job. She ran 5 miles every day and always was put together.  Due to her job, she worked lots of hours and I didn't see her that much growing up. (she is an amazing mom and I understand the sacrifices she had to make to raise us). My life was normal, I had never faced a single hardship. However, in my second semester of junior year in HS my mom lost her job. She became extremely depressed for two months and started sleeping all day every day. This was extremely out of character for her. She attempted to kill herself and I found her and took her to the hospital.  She spent a week in a mental hospital. Though she is an amazing person, she doesn't save money and doesn't ever ask for help. Unbeknownst to my sister and me, we were broke.  We moved out of our childhood home into a family friend townhouse, 4 of us and 3 pets. She eventually did get better and got a job about 7 months after.

I never went to therapy and just continued on with my life. I had extreme paranoia and general anxiety. I stopped caring about my appearance, stopped showering, started smoking a lot of weed, I knew I was depressed. I never felt like I was in my life, just coasting through. My senior year was spent with ups and downs.. I had high functioning depression. I spent that summer in my bed. I was always numb, and since I had nothing that excited me, I began to obsess over my body. I would spend hours every day taking pictures of my naked body comparing it to the day before. I had very very bad body dysmorphia and couldn't picture what I looked like if my life depended on it.  Fast forward to college, I went across the country to four-year in new England. I carried all the same issues with me but like I said I can function a normal life with depression.  I still went to class, made friends, joined a sorority,  partied (barely), and met boys. but, I was always numb and couldn't be myself. I got a nicotine addiction because that 5 seconds of head rush gave me something to feel. I play with my sleep ((stay up all night with caffeine (for the buzz) and sleep until 1 pm.

Winter break (now ) one day I woke up cleaned my room and completely reorganized (real depressioners know how crazy this is ) and began to want to read self-help books.I feel alive and happy (not manic) It's like my depression just literally disappeared? I also picked up a new brand of cart and had a very good high with it.. wondering if that had something to do with it thast caused a shift in my brain?

Back story,  I'm 34m, 2 years out of a long relationship with an abusive partner.

,mentalhealth,"I think I have schizophrenia because most (by most I don’t mean just a few off from all but really close to all) of the symptoms line up with me, but the thing is that whenever my mom forced me to go to the doctor I said nothing to him so the only thing he thinks I have is low anxiety and low depression but the reason behind that is because my mom told him things, I never said anything, I used to cut a lot but I’m so pale that you couldn’t see the scars.

,mentalhealth,"I’m a 3rd year university student studying psychology and for the past year I haven’t been able to get off my mind the idea that the education system is in dire need of tweaking when it comes to teaching students about mental health. IMO There’s way too much time and research going into treatment studies and into identifying risk factors for mental illnesses instead of PREVENTION strategies. I’m 20 now, and I realized that for the past 8 years, I’ve been using a variety of different coping mechanisms and distractions to deal with the increasing occurrence of unpleasant emotional states I would experience. Children turning into teenagers naturally start to experience changes in their mood states, thought processes, etc, which is normal! What isn’t normal when you think about it is that the education system teaches students next to nothing about how to manage and interact with your feelings, thoughts, and emotions. It’s like throwing a baby into a pool. And 1/3 of these kids parents will have their own, completely inadequate and lacking script of how to function that they’ll pass onto their children. 

When I was 12 I became anorexic. When I was 16, I moved on and discovered bulimia. My eating disorders tormented me throughout my whole high school experience and only ended in my first year university. The thing is it wasn’t so much about my body image. I’m still not sure what stress or emotions triggered it in me. The EDs do seem to be in my past for good as I haven’t relapsed in 2 years (nothings ever permanent, but I’ve moved from vice to vice and doubt I would go back to those) When I was 12 I had nothing in my repertoire - no tools in my toolbox - and I guess I thought I found something (starving myself), that made me feel good. And because it made me feel good, I hid my disordered eating from my family and friends the whole time, because if they knew, they’d try and take my disorder away from me - And my daily thoughts and feelings completely revolved around my obsession with food and the control that I had over it and my body. At the time, I thought that if they took my disorder out of MY hands (by forcing me to get help), then everything was over for me. I probably felt that way because I didn’t know there are practices to help you manage intense feelings and emotions.

I’m not sure what job I’m going into yet after university, BUT I know that I need to contribute in some way to reforming school policies so that mental health and mind management techniques are prioritized, and become considered as important as the other subjects. Because aren’t they?? Depression and anxiety can be so debilitating that people sometimes turn to suicide. Pretty sure learning about ways to manage negative affect are more important than trying to decipher Shakespeare plays for weeks on end in English class. I’m not saying that teaching children how to navigate information, stimuli, and their consequent thought processes is the end all be all for mental health disorders. I recognize that there truly are chemical imbalances in the brain and I think medication is so important for stabilizing people and giving them a second to finally get some air from whatever they are dealing with. But why do we learn all of these techniques to reframe our thoughts SO LATE, when someones already fallen depressed and fantasized many a time about killing themselves? Only THEN it’s time for a therapist to come in and try to teach you how to rewire your brain. Instead of attempting to teach an adult who has been functioning with a certain maladaptive schema for their whole life how to build an newer, healthier one, why don’t we start that processes earlier, when children’s life story and development is just beginning and their minds are like an empty book waiting to be printed on. We could fully equip children with all of the tools and information they need to be an objective observer of their own mind. 

I’d love to know, anyone who works with a school board, or has younger children, what the curriculum is like now? I was in elementary school only 8 years ago but you never know, things may have changed and perhaps steps have been taken to implement this idea!

,mentalhealth,"So, I'm dealing with lots of stuff at the minute...as most of you all are and I just dont know how to feel or what to do.

I'm not going into details because it's a long list of things but it boils down to how I should act and feel when it comes to my wife.

She has spent the last 3 years caring after our kids, always putting herself first and making sure they are raised the best way possible, some thing I admire in her and love her for. However, recently she has wanted to find herself and that has meant that she is distancing herself from me, not the kids, and wanting to do things on her own.

Now I dont have a problem with it in theory but we have always done things together.. since we first met, and I mean everything, so I am finding it hard to not see this as a rejection or not being good enough for her. Coupled with that is the fact she has started making friends, one in particular who is another man with who she flirts with constantly..even progressing beyond that whilst at the same time not showing any interest in me.

I also have problems making and maintaining friendships, I am casual acquaintances with many people but not really friends yet she believes that they are friends which causes issues when I say this to her.

In the past I have been upset and told her what she does and more importantly how she goes about it upsets me  ut she dismisses these and tells me I'm a ""drama queen"" and just manipulating her to control her and put her down...which is not the case.

At new years I had a bit of a mental break and now I am just trying to live by the motto ""what will be will be"" and think she will do what ever she wants to do and if she wants to leave she will. My issue is that it destroys me to think I'm not good enough and that I can be everything she wants outside the bedroom  but that she doesn't want me, is uninterested and rejects me inside the bedroom.

To top it off I am overweight, feel incredibly unattractive and ugly, a waste of time and effort and generally not good enough in any aspect of my life. I have also suffered a serious of injuries that has resulted in me having surgery last week which means another 8 weeks of not being independent. I don't have an positive reinforcement about how I look or if I am doing a good job but the issues are always highlighted to me.

So, I know how it feels to “just” feel really, really bad. It’s agonizing. Just lying around, staring at the ceiling and having this pressure and pain in my chest because I’m in so much pain mentally.

But two years ago (I think, might be less) I started to really suddenly have a weird feeling. I just call it the weird feeling. I could be having a kinda normal day in the life, sitting on my couch and wham! There’s that weird feeling. It hurts, I feel weird, there’s a different kind of pain in my chest.

Until a couple years ago I was involved with drugs. And if I didn’t know any better, I would describe it as coming down of MDMA. You’re having a good time and suddenly there’s the pain again but way worse. That’s kinda what it feels like?


I just wanted to ask if any of you experience the same thing because I can’t determine where it came from or what it is. Is it anxiety? Depression? Seems like some neurotransmitters in my brain were suddenly stopped or released for a short amount of time?

Lately I've been numb. I stay up all night and wake up until 5pm.

I don't get that much out of bed, and when I do, I just play videogames. I'm not interested in anyone, or anything, in that matter. I don't feel well either. There are days where I'm excessively stressed about small things, and end up playing games and try to forget why I was so stressed. I also have some trouble doing stuff by myself. For example, I can't and won't order food when there's nothing at home, 'cause it just stresses me out, or clean my room, 'cause I find it overwhelming even if it's just a scarf on the floor. I also have a lot of trouble when I'm alone. I have this weird problem, where I feel the need to even out every single one of my movements. For example, let's say my right hand stroke my cat... well my brain suddenly has the intense urge of stroking it with the left one, and if I don't, I get really anxious. This only happens when I become aware of me. It's not as often as you think though. Finally I'm sad that I don't have anyone to talk to. My parents are separated, and I only talk to my dad abt unimportant stuff, and my mom is just a very complicated person, and scolds me when I talk abt stress, 'cause it's just ""unreasonable for you to be stressed, wait until you're an adult, then you'll see"".

For example, I can&amp;#39;t and won&amp;#39;t order food when there&amp;#39;s nothing at home, &amp;#39;cause it just stresses me out, or clean my room, &amp;#39;cause I find it overwhelming even if it&amp;#39;s just a scarf on the floor. I also have a lot of trouble when I&amp;#39;m alone. I have this weird problem, where I feel the need to even out every single one of my movements. For example, let&amp;#39;s say my right hand stroke my cat... well my brain suddenly has the intense urge of stroking it with the left one, and if I don&amp;#39;t, I get really anxious. This only happens when I become aware of me. It&amp;#39;s not as often as you think though. Finally I&amp;#39;m sad that I don&amp;#39;t have anyone to talk to. My parents are separated, and I only talk to my dad abt unimportant stuff, and my mom is just a very complicated person, and scolds me when I talk abt stress, &amp;#39;cause it&amp;#39;s just &amp;quot;unreasonable for you to be stressed, wait until you&amp;#39;re an adult, then you&amp;#39;ll see&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of you can tell me what is wrong with me, or has any kind of advice or something, please PLEASE tell me. Again, if there&amp;#39;s a better subreddit to ask this, feel free to tell me abt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to get straight to the point. Mental Health treatment in it's current iteration here in the USA is fundamentally broken/flawed. A person in crisis, essentially, cannot simply ask for help and receive any in return. A person has to make a scene &amp; spectacle of themselves, threatening to harm themselves or others. The fatal flaw in this system is that many people, MANY PEOPLE, are pushed to the edge, and end up killing themselves or others, after having the door slammed in their face so many times, simply because they didn't put on a show for mental health workers.

,mentalhealth,"(On mobile) (apologies in advance for punctuation errors)

For some background I work as a commercial truck driver, by that virtue I'm pretty isolated and only stay in contact with direct family and a few friends. 

I'll try to summarize, I met a much younger woman then me online around February of last year, we hit it off pretty well, talked a lot about music, shows, and psychology. She was very shy at the time but very sweet, found out from her that her family also worked in trucking, so they understood what my lifestyle was. Everything seemed to be going okay, I had met the family, the dad seem apathetic but I wasn't rude about it (we work crazy hours and he worked overnight). 

We hung out at her parent's house a few times, and that was pretty uneventful, I do remember sometime in either May or June where I was scrolling through facebook and one of my close friends posted something naughty and kind of cute, (which was stuff we'd been sharing for over a decade at this point), and she got upset with the sexuality of the image and pulled me into her room, apparently she was very jealous of the gif. This should have set my red flags off right there. From then on it was some good times, permeated by her being upset about things I reacted to on FB or watched, a constant self loathing diatribe about how everyone was more attractive then her, and no matter how much a protested what she said, she would just ignore what I said. 

Things had been up and down until around November, she had been doing much better with the social comparison and anxiety, and we had talked about having a child together, around that time we decided to go through with it, around mid November she came back positive, everything was actually progressive very nicely, we were in good spirits. Then it happened, early in December, she brought up my close friend that I'd known for over 15 years (she'd brought her up multiple times before as justification for me cheating), and proceeded to yell, spam, or otherwise shout at me for being a liar, cheater, scum, unworthy of fatherhood. I recognized that she really hadn't been disciplined at all throughout her early life and which led to her developmentally being behind, because her parents wouldn't sit her down and force her to continue her studies. Over the course of the argument she just kept going on and on repeating herself over and over, not listening to reason or anything I say, until I said I felt like striking her (I meant a slap, but she took it as punching or something else), because she wouldn't stop escalating and ignoring me, of course that was flipped to say I was abusive, and then retroactively said I was abusive to my exes (even though I never touched anyone). I'm pretty tall at 6'4"" and have dated pretty petite women all my life, and I already well know I could never get away with anything of the sort because who would people listen to? The tiny woman or the 6ft tall man? You get the idea. After that she just escalated to say she was going to put the baby up for adoption, with out any say from me, I was furious, because this time she had been starting arguments based on her own insecurities, and essentially expected me to just take it all and agree with everything. It took family stepping in to diffuse the situation. 

There were a few small arguments since then but nothing to serious, I'd been functioning okay, but early this past week she went nuclear over a post I made about my trans friend who had taken up cocaine and meth and fell off the face of the earth. The comic in the post was romantic, but I wasn't really paying attention to that (I cared about the acceptance part of it). I had posted it earlier in the day, she only saw it after getting online around noon, but she just started spamming, saying everything from being worthless, to saying I wanted to fuck that friend, to that she wanted to kill me, and again that I was vile, and scum, and unworthy. Her mom eventually calmed her down, and it seemed okay for a time, her parents took away her phone later because she was always looking up stuff that upset her or supported/fed her anxieties.

For me even just a day after the phone was gone, I started losing it, I was already a pretty battered and depressed person before all of this, I thought having a child would give me a sense of purpose and a reason to live, but something broke in me, I've never wanted to leave someone in the way I am now, her mother plays it off as Pregnancy Psychosis, but I can't handle being yelled at for not doing anything really bad. Being constantly accused of cheating and lying hit me all at once, I loved her, I thought she was beautiful, wanted to make her happy, but nothing ever seemed to be enough, and everything I did was either not said right or just wrong to her. I'm feeling severely disconnected and I am not feeling anything for the baby either, I just suddenly stopped feeling, and I don't know what to do about it.

I know everything is disjointed, but I feel very alone in my situation, I feel abused, and disrespected. It does feel as if everyone expects me to be the responsible adult, but would never let me be one. I feel rudderless and stagnant with not control over my life, even though I continue to do my job, eat and take care of myself.

,mentalhealth,"I'm spending the next month fundraising for an amazing Australian charity that helps with mental health, beyondblue. 

A little bit about me:

A couple years ago I was starting to notice a change in myself. I was lethargic, bored all the time and got annoyed at every little thing. I started just not caring about anything. It wasn't until one time driving home thinking I couldn't really care if a car hit me and I didn't make it out alive. I realized at that moment that I wasn't my normal self. I still didn't get help but took time of work and seemed to get better or so I thought with nothing popping up. Then my mum died suddenly while I was home and I went off the deep end. Everything crumbled around me and I didn't even know the worst would come a year down the track. I had a blow up at my boss and that was it, I broke down and went to the doctor who finally prescribed me medication. It took time but I felt much better, I still go through bad patches and sometimes really bad patches but as a whole I've picked up my life from where I was at.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright a little about my charity efforts:

I got an amazing response from my friends and family when I decided to post it on Facebook and I smashed my original goal of $500. I've still got a month to run on my fundraising so I'm really hoping to hit $1500 by the end with the amazing help of family and friends.

My fundraising consists of 2 fundraising events:

\- 24 hour stream on 14/2/2020 from 10am Western Australia Time

\- Fundraising Day at my sport club on 16/2/2020

&amp;#x200B;

How can you help?

\- Checking out beyondblue and the work they do.

\- checking out the 24 hour stream (don't mind you leaving once it's done, it's more about joining in on something that can help on the day)

\- Know of any gaming company that might help out with raffle donations? Please let me know as I would love to be able to do some giveaways 

\- If you are in Western Australia and would like to come to the charity day just contact me. I would love to meet you and have you come down for the day.

\- Just reading this post I hope it helps with anyone that is currently struggling.

I wish there was a way where we could connect more people together and focus more on the reality that we aren't as different as we may think. Mental health is something so personal and vulnerable to be able to share with our peers. 

I am determined to help with this stigma and emphasize that generating awareness is one of the most important parts of improving mental health among millennials. We have created a google form that asks a few questions regarding mental health and anxiety among this younger generation.

We will keep anonymity for every submission and want to be able to share these stories with those who may benefit from reading about other people's situations. We strive to create a community of people to help normalize talking about mental health and realize we are all humans who experience these things. Share this if you think someone can benefit from this in order to share their story!

,mentalhealth,"I've posted on this subreddit for awhile about my deteriorating mental health, and I finally checked myself into a looney bin six days ago.  I thought I'd be there longer but it was almost a week so I guess that's long enough.  It wasn't the most fun experience but it wasn't terrible either.  I feel like I got a lot of help and I'm surprised that I feel better coming out of it than going in.

Things I disliked:

The strip search.  I tried to get out of it but the doctor and orderly performing it told me to ""just get it over with"".  Had to get totally naked for a minute, thankfully there was no shit like cavity searches.  It was uncomfortable for everyone I can tell from their faces and thankfully was over with in no time.  

The closed and sterile setting creeped me out.  Everything was so clean and so safe, its not what Im used to.  I know it's a hospital but it's still weird.

Bed times, as an adult I actually had a bed time.  Most of the time I didn't sleep and I didn't sleep much at all during the six days I was there, and would fall asleep during group therapy and even individual therapy lol.  I tried to leave my room at night and just walk around but was (politely) told by orderly I cant do that and they gave me more magazines and books to read than Ive read in years.  When you dont have a phone, things get really boring fast.

No cursing.  I was told this in the common area that I curse too much and to not use f bombs and to stop cursing like a sailor.  When I first refused, they threatened to take me back to my room.  And we were all adults.

The showers were communal.  Had to shower with three other guys, blegh it was not fun.

I had to make a pledge to not self harm and not attempt escape (I voluntarily went in but still needed a discharge to leave) and told me if I got violent and assaulted anyone, they would press charges.  I felt like I was in prison when they told me that.

They made me eat enough to stop losing weight, and the food was not very good.  They thought I might be developing an eating disorder.  Having to scarf down hospital food is not the most pleasant of experiences but at least they gave you a choice what to eat.  Ate a lot of seafood.


Things I liked:

I liked actually being able to talk to psychologists and psychiatrists all the time.  I thought they would be condescending and rude, but they were understanding and nice and they really wanted to help me.  I basically spilled my guts and told them everything, and they told me ways to deal with self-harm and tried meds on me that I'm now taking and are actually working, it frankly surprises me.

The orderly were actually very nice.  I asked the orderly who escorted me to my room what do I do to not be on their bad side, they said just don't get in trouble and we won't mess with you.  Surprisingly I had no bad experiences with them minus them telling me to stop cursing and one time disconnecting my phone because I wouldn't get off of it.  That was also an annoying aspect, I'd call my girlfriend or brother and they'd get mad if it was over 20 minutes.  Was very annoying not having my own phone.

The visiting hours were generous, my girlfriend visited me every day and it'd be for around an hour.  Helped me through the isolation.  I assumed it'd just be once a week and just be between glass like in a jail.  

I drew a lot.  A lot of group therapy was fun and stimulating, I thought it'd just be fruity nonsense I wouldn't be able to use.  But I drew a lot to express myself.  I guess kind of childish but I liked doing it.

The patients were nice, I was in a part with suicidal and self harm patients and they weren't mean or violent and my roommate was pretty nice, he was just 19 and he was going through a lot of rough stuff, we would talk sometimes after bed time for a few hours and we became pretty friendly.

I feel like the medication and the cognitive behavorial therapy has really helped me.  Only time will tell, but I think this was the right choice to make.

They told me not to hesitate calling back and checking myself in again if I need to, Im surprised they didn't want me out as soon as possible.

Overall, I'm glad I did it, but it still felt like I was in a cushier jail.  But I think it saved my life, for now anyway.

They set me up with a new therapist and psychiatrist and hopefully things work well with them.  So hey, I'm not dead, not yet anyway!

,mentalhealth,"I need help. I dont know what to do anymore.  I think I have a dissociative disorder. 

Im going to split this into 2 sections to make it easier. (1). A bit of background / growing up experiences and (2). how i feel

Please forgive my spelling or grammar or whatever im typing this on my phone at like 1:30 am

(1). Im just putting this here for background purposes weather it will give some sort of insight on how im feeling or not , i dont know.
growing up i didnt have the worst childhood or the most difficult but it still messed me up and i think this stems from that. 

Im a male in my early 20s now but At a young age i was diagnosed with pretty severe ADHD and later on really bad anxiety and depression. Growing up my parents were decent enough and i had a few friends like every kid but my mother and fathers work had us move later down the road.  I think i was like 6 the first time we moved. New school , new people , no family except my parents and my younger brother. Started making friends again then within the next year and a half we moved again. This kept up for a long time. we would move, settle down, id make a friend or 2 then wed move within 1-2 years, each move a couple hours away from where we lived before. In total we had moved 11-12 times from me being age 6-18. After about the 5th move i just kind of gave up trying to meet new people and make friends cause what was the point if i was probably just going to move again. I didnt have a phone or any real way to keep in contact with old friends except like one or 2 of them. So for a long time i would be that new quiet kid in the back of the class that wouldn’t talk to anyone and was only around for the grade. I became shy, isolated, and basicly antisocial even though the only thing i wanted was a friend that wouldnt be gone in a year. When i got to high school i was at a new school again and i got bullied alot and had a couple mental breakdowns that almost led to suicide and to top it all off my mother and father had started to fight alot and eventually got a divorce because my mother wanted to be a party animal and made dumb decisions. I moved again at the end of my sophomore year back to my home town where i finished off high school. My junior and senior years were actually ok (ok as in i didnt get bullied and i did actually talk to some people on ocassion) but when high school was over i fell out of contact with all of them. And i guess over the years i really fell behind in the social department because i even now have a kinda hard time communicating with people (little to no eye contact, slightly awkward, difficulty conveying emotions and feelings) i still talk to those 2 friends and they are my best friends but besides them no one else really knows who i am. I haven’t been in a relationship scene early middle school and i want nothing more than just to be loved, understood and feel alive again.

(2). I feel empty. I space out often and stare off into the distance with a blank mind alot. I feel disconnected from everything around me like everything is fake. Like how a movie or a video game feels looking at a tv screen and it doesnt feel 3d or have any depth just like a picture, thats how i feel when i look around.  I dont take in my surroundings fully. a bright and lively room feels the same as standing outside at night in the quiet.  My mind feels foggy like it is always on autopilot weather it be at work, talking to someone, or at home alone.  Its difficult to explain like my mind and body are separate sorta like if you were to sit on someones shoulders and they did everything you would do but you yourself aren’t actually doing it if that makes sense.  Ive felt like this for as long as i can remember.  I dont think its depression but i could be wrong. Ill still smile and feel emotions on rare occasion but not very often or for very long. And i know something is wrong because sometimes i get these moments of clarity where i look around and feel like im seeing everything and feeling the size and scale of the room but i loose my focus and it fades away.   

I don’t exactly get the best sleep at night (i say as i type this at 2:30 am) so i feel like that is a factor of some sort.  I hang out with some people now on occasion but it doesn’t make me feel any different. Even when i talk to by best buddies i feel the same.  I dont have any real motivation or feeling to push onward and it feels like im only doing it cause i have to.   I still dont drive cause im terrified that because of this im going to space out or feel disconnected while driving and hurt myself or even worse, someone else.   Id prefer to not see a therapist or psychologist as i have bad experiences with them not caring or not listening to me. I know they are not all like that but it has a sort of negative association connected to them for me because of past experiences unfortunately. If i really have to ill try again but id like to know if anyone has some sort of advice or just an opinion or thoughts on how i should go about this.

Like how a movie or a video game feels looking at a tv screen and it doesnt feel 3d or have any depth just like a picture, thats how i feel when i look around.  I dont take in my surroundings fully. a bright and lively room feels the same as standing outside at night in the quiet.  My mind feels foggy like it is always on autopilot weather it be at work, talking to someone, or at home alone.  Its difficult to explain like my mind and body are separate sorta like if you were to sit on someones shoulders and they did everything you would do but you yourself aren’t actually doing it if that makes sense.  Ive felt like this for as long as i can remember.  I dont think its depression but i could be wrong. Ill still smile and feel emotions on rare occasion but not very often or for very long. And i know something is wrong because sometimes i get these moments of clarity where i look around and feel like im seeing everything and feeling the size and scale of the room but i loose my focus and it fades away.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t exactly get the best sleep at night (i say as i type this at 2:30 am) so i feel like that is a factor of some sort.  I hang out with some people now on occasion but it doesn’t make me feel any different. Even when i talk to by best buddies i feel the same.  I dont have any real motivation or feeling to push onward and it feels like im only doing it cause i have to.   I still dont drive cause im terrified that because of this im going to space out or feel disconnected while driving and hurt myself or even worse, someone else.   Id prefer to not see a therapist or psychologist as i have bad experiences with them not caring or not listening to me. I know they are not all like that but it has a sort of negative association connected to them for me because of past experiences unfortunately. If i really have to ill try again but id like to know if anyone has some sort of advice or just an opinion or thoughts on how i should go about this. Im at a loss and i just want help.&lt;/p&gt;

,mentalhealth,"

One day i woke up and i have no emotions, nothing. I have NO thought process, a VERY blank mind, like you know that voice inside your head? that internal monologue? I don't have one. I don't think ANYTHING at all, I don't feel ANY anxiety, and I can't connect with anyone or anything. It feels like im half asleep or on auto pilot all the time.  Basically, I feel stupid, have no feelings of anxiety, emotions or depression, just blankness, with no thoughts, I can't for the life of my understand OTHER people, like I have no theory of mind of other people, and I lack a thought process, I really can't compose a single thought in my head really, its like just blank, like a severe mental block. It makes me feel stupid, i can't follow tv shows, or process the emotions that they ""expect"" the viewers to interrupt to feel empathetic for the character. I just feel SOOO detached from life, like im literally not experiencing it. Before when I was hypervigilant I was OVERLY experiencing it, now its the opposite. Im a dofferent person , extremely suicidal, bad things happen to me

what does this lack of emotional/social/academic intelligence, and blank mind in sound like to you, PTSD or brain damage? I also have a HORRIBLE short term memory, like a gold fish, literally. Life has lost all its feeling, can't feel depressed, cant feel happy, cant feel sad, life is dull and flat, and empty, like nothingness.

I also feel VERY tired all the time, nothing excites me or gets me going (while when I was hypervigilant I was almost maniac), I can sleep FOREVER. I just don't FEEL like im in the world, I don't feel attached to my surrounds, its like my brains stopped integrating stuff, and I'm just some empty robotic shell.

It's like I'm not attached to my thought process, I can feel it going on somewhere, but I cant FEEL it, or get in sync with it, its like I'm outside of it, just numb and empty minded 24/7. Everything is like a movie and nothing matters. My life is like a box and im not a person. Ive lost my soul or something . Nothing stimulates me not even games or Tv. I cant laugh or ever have a moment where i feel like me or good. I look at things strange and empty. I feel trapped . Like im burried alive. I just want to live

Before this happened i was PERFECT. Really into spirituality, connected to god , had everything going for me and nothing wrong.i was so happy and into life now i just feel like darkness like evil. I didnt have any traumatizing events. I feel like a loser and that no one likes me, that they can see my negative energy or whatever this is and thing bad and wrong of me. Im not in reality and not aware of anything. I feel like im in a different world and the days are the same and keep going. Im in a relationship and dont feel anything. We fight everyday because i dont love him and im not me or in control and i do stupid things. I dont feel emotions or anything. I need help. I feel like i’ll be stuck like this and want to die. I feel like there’s something else here. If someone died who i knew i wouldnt feel anything or care. I cant get satisfied or anything its like im not alive or here. If i watch a video im completely blank and empty and i feel like i’m 5. I feel immature and as if i have autism or something (i dont). I need help im in a different reality. My minds empty and i mean it. Theres no self. I feel like theres this shiled around me where im in a different reality. I stare blankly into space and think of nothing. Im zoned out 24/7 and dont feel grounded or in my body.im going crazy every second, i have no control at all and no stimulation and feel so cut off from reality everything looks blank and slow. I feel so stuck i just want to die. I feel cut off from EVERYTHING, and every day and second is hell. Theres no grasp of anything, i feel like smashing things and going crazy. i ignore everyone because im blank inside and not in reality to be in a conversation or anything (not like i can). Im scared what this is. Im scared if its some negative energy, another dimension, lost my soul, my mind, im possessed, i wont ever be the same, my life going to hell and etc. no one could understand this or how it feels. If u talk to me i will literally say “... im not me” “if i were me...” and literally nothing. I have no self, no likes , interests or anything. I cant go out anywhere because its like nothing, completely empty, meaningless, and no feelings. I feel stuck in my head and not in the outside world. No drugs help, i dont feel anything. I dont feel relaxation from going in a hot tub, cuddling, or anything. I dont know what this is considering one day i woke up and felt this, but the first couple days and week i was just so confused and disorientated and acted so differently. I woke up felt like a slob, acted like a slob, was lifeless, ate CHIPS for breakfast and only ate junk food. I would never do that. I was always classy, clean, active, happy, at a high vibration and etc. i cant get turned on, horny, exited or anything. I feel so far from my mind and body and everything. Theres no days and every day is the same. This isnt normal. I get very violent and get into physical fights with my boyfriend and feel out of control. When i was me i had the biggest heart, the most sweetest girl, spiritually connected and would never hit or hurt anyone mentally or physically. I just want to escape this but dont know how. Its been since august 2019. I feel outside of reality and my body. Like I’m just watching everything.

,mentalhealth,"I have been experiencing what I believe to be depression since grade 11, maybe even grade 10. I am in my third year of university now. When I tried to tell my dad back in high school that I thought I might be depressed he brushed it off as ""teenage angst."" I knew that teenage angst didn't make you want to kill yourself, but I felt so let down by the person I could usually turn to that I didn't pursue it further. After some horrible mental breakdowns in my first year of university I reached out to the campus counselors. While helpful, they of course couldn't diagnose me with anything and that has always been my issue. I don't think that people should rely on a self-diagnosis, but my opinion started to change the more people would refuse to help me and provide me with answers. I told my doctor before I started my second year at uni about the depression and he prescribed me anti-depressants. This was a fantastic step, and they help me a lot, but still having never been diagnosed I still felt like I had no answers. Being prescribed those meds, while a blessing, also seemed to be my curse as anytime I then tried to reach out to someone to try and get a diagnosis they would turn me away because I was already on meds. Apparently they had already done their due diligence and I would be a waste of their resources. At a check up I mentioned to the physician that I wanted a diagnosis and she told me I shouldn't bother.  It took crying on the phone with mental health services in my city to crying in my doctor's office to even get a referral. But it worked. I just got a call from a psychiatrists office and have an appointment with them next Tuesday for an assessment. 

I feel so much lighter all of a sudden, it's the only way I can describe it. There are certain services at my university and in my community that I can only access with an official diagnosis and I have managed to overcome every person who told me that it was a waste of time to get one. Yes, my medication helps me, but I have so many underlying issues that require more attention. Not to mention that I might also have something other than depression, or along side depression. Only a professional can tell me and by God I am so ready to find out. 

As a message of hope for anyone who reads this, don't give up. You can get help.

,mentalhealth,"5 yrs GAD. 

A couple of days ago my anxiety levels went back to it’s peak because of this new thing I’m experiencing.

It all started last week due to poor sleep like 3-4 hours a day and poor diet plus I had fasted a day before and was going into ketosis so no sugar that week. 

I’ve been hearing melodies on repeat in my mind. Not externally, not a loud sound, hard to explain. I’m trying to keep calm and accept but it’s so annoying. I’m fearing of going crazy, trying not to add fuel to the fire but I need somebody to reassure me that this will stop. 

it started as my home doorbell now I have “jingle bells” added to the playlist.

It got so bad I went to the hospital but only saw an ER medical doctor and he had no answers for me...

Ever since I started sleeping again thanks to the prescribed mirtazapine (7.5) the sound feels like it’s coming from another room but it still on repeat non stop. The more I think about it the more it repeats, it stops when my mind is focused on something else.

I’ve never experienced this type of intrusive ocd thought before so idk...

You can check my last posts in /anxiety /ocd for more info.
